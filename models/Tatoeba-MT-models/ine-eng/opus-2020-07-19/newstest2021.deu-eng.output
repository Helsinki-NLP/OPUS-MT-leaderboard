Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters burned
After a Corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavarian Mamming, almost 500 people are under quarantine and must not leave the holding.
A security service is monitoring the exit ban.
A total of 174 harvest helpers were tested positively on the Corona-Ereger Sars-CoV-2, as reported by the Dingolfing-Landau Landau Landing Board on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further proliferation, we have to take this step to protect the population," said Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Seven employees had already been infected in the operation before - this was the reason for the series.
The farm is a large vegetable garden, the strawberries, barley, coal and red beet about - but the barley is only for storage bottles.
Mamming is a rural municipality with a population of 3300 people not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW shop.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to remain calm: "After our information it is a closed circle of persons".
Infected by uninfected employees were separated from the court, the site is now surrounded by a barrier.
Green and SPD were co-responsibility to the government.
The two opposition groups proposed to the Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet to neglect the control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can be worse if such local infectious events occur and regional lockdowns have to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary manager of the Greens.
This is similar to the SPD: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof Mid-May we have already requested a special control programme for farmers with harvest aid," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"Just the health conditions at work and the living conditions must be strictly controlled from our point of view.
This obviously didn't happen."
The outbreak was "with an announcement".
Aidenbachstraße Metro Station: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-olds fall to Schubser's bed
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße metro station, a 19-year-old fell by a shoemaker and was taken to bed.
Oversendling - On Friday it came to a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße metro station against 4.15 p.m.
A passerby alarmed the police who attacked with several stripes.
According to the first investigations, a Municher (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man jumped over the railway side and fell into the bed of the road.
People from the 17-year-old group helped the stutterer to climb out of the loop.
There was no danger through an invading train.
As the police report, there was a conflict between the two.
The 17-year-old escaped from the tattoo, but his staff were able to be identified in the background.
With his father, he joined the police inspector 29.
By the age of 17, it is detected because of injury to the body.
Report: Seehofer insists on longer storage of storage data
The storage of storage data is currently suspended.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer, however, calls for an extension of the storage time after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of storage data - instead of the planned ten weeks a year.
As the "Image on Sunday" reports, Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter about a rapid legislative change.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He thinks it makes sense to "make the necessary adjustments in the law already," the newspaper quoted from the letter.
The storage of storage data is currently suspended.
A decision of the EuGH is expected to do so.
However, seehofer already wants the amendments to be applied immediately after a possible positive decision, that is to say in the report.
A spokesperson of the Ministry of Justice said the newspaper said that it was only reasonable to examine whether legal adjustments were necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the domestic ministers of the countries, had already spoken for a record storage in June.
NBA: Strip clubs for Clippers Star Lou Williams
Exciting in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), the Los Angeles Clippers basketball pro, is supposed to leave the tournament neighborhood in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. news, he visited the Magic City strip club in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who should have given the visit according to ESPN data, is again in isolation, is tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for these Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Anm. d. R.) have the best waves in the city".
NBA-Insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday at Twitter that the NBA Williams has arranged a ten-day quarantine.
This way, the clippers star misses the first two official parties after the test play phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finals that begin at night on Friday.
Söder expresses himself after mass infection to the Corona position
Munich - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a Tefofensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be seen live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the Dingolfing-Landau district has frightened authorities and politicians.
Currently, almost 500 harvest workers from several countries are working at the large vegetable farm, over a third have been infected with the Corona bug.
The court is currently under quarantine and is closed with a building.
No one can leave the land, food is delivered.
The good 3300 inhabitants of the municipality now offer free Corona tests.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the Land Council has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the court.
"Wisdombisse": the confession of the moderate fire-fighting of Nantes
"My mandate has been cooperative," said counsel Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defendant added: "He deeply regrets the actions, the confession was a release for him".
His mandate was "prescribed by conscience and taken very seriously by the extent of destruction".
In the case of a conviction, the man is threatened by ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was badly damaged last Saturday night by a fire.
The fire broke out in three far-off places in the church.
Laboratory investigations undermined the suspicion of firefighting.
The suspect now arrested had been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after one day.
The man worked as a volunteer for the Diocese Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the night before the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly runs into the field of views of the mediator.
discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB President Reinhard Grindel recommended the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"The German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts," said the Grindel of the "Image on Sunday".
He stressed: "For the associations that can become dangerous to the former Bavarian and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work at all: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, the debate is not about whether it is not recommended that associations which wish to join this Phalanx should facilitate the involvement of investors."
But he has doubts whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations prohibited in the Federal League by the 50+1 rule.
"There remains a legal risk of attracting the Bundesliga business site in a European internal market," Grindel said.
The former DFB leader sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Federal League will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top club at European level, but not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even a flat-rate distribution of TV money will not produce a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already huge among the first three associations.
The other 15 associations have an average budget of 130 million," said 58-year-olds.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there were people who noticed this error and went through the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said about the adoption of a expensive watch that had led to his retreat in April 2019.
"I've been very busy with this."
The gift worth about 11,000 euros had been received by a Ukrainian official.
"I have committed a violation of compliance, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," Grindel said.
"With the ominous watch gift, I've gone completely transparent and ridiculously.
Many in the DFB knew about it."
He never made a "hell out of the gift," assured the 58-year-olds.
"This may be called naive, in any case this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

She announced that after several years of break 2021 a Rakoczy race tournament would take place again.

Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time weather master Tony Martin can fully imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just putting down the framework conditions with the team, how and in what form it could go on," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper".

Argentina rejects the offer of creditors
The new requirements could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," said one opinion.
"While 50 percent of children live in Argentina in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our believers."
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under the current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina calls on its private creditors to ignore some of its claims of around US$66 billion (about €59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country again threatens the state square.
It would be the ninth payout in the Argentine history.
Last but not least, the creditors had required higher interest on State bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government remains firm in its last offer and is not prepared for any further concessions.
Argentina is in a difficult financial and economic crisis.
The last inflation rate was more than 50 per cent.
For the current year, experts estimate a decrease in economic power by about 10 percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to cover interest payments of $503 million and was thus due to a limited payment loss.
Professional arrival - not yet private
"It's going great" - this fact draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
At the end, everything went very fast: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer found out that she was going to be the successor of Lutz Feler at the Eggenfelden Notariatspost.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the promoted lawyer took up the work that the normal daily business is running on full tours for a long time.
"I still have to arrive in private," she explains in conversation with the Rotteller ad and laughs.
Of course, the short period of time has not been enough to completely drop Regensburg's food point to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolingerin.
She was currently working with her husband, who is a judge in Regensburg, looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband has been able to apply for a short period of parental time to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 111⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to spend every day of Regensburg hangings, they sometimes also have a night opportunity with their parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-olds.
Grown up in the neighbourhood, of course, the town of Eggenfelden is a concept for a long time.
When visiting the site with her family in the past months, she recently found "Eggenfelden is a pretty small town".
More than that, she was pleased that she had made the race in the selection process around the free place.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career, her home in Lowerbayern plays a central role: after the Jura study in Passau she gave up her reference period and the second state exam in Regensburg.
After several stations as notarassessorin, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in the Underallgäu as well as Regensburg - at that time she also "besides" praised the promotion in labour law - in 2012 she entered her first position as notarin in Rotthalmünster in the Passau district.
In 2016 she moved to Regensburg in parenting time, and finally moved to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services at various notariats.
When the post in Eggenfelden was written out because of the close rest of Lutz Feler, she saw the right time for the full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-olds.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the Notariatste, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has just a praise for the staff of the office: "It's going great!"
The fact that she can rely on the steps taken here makes it easier to take care of the forthcoming movement of the private food point.
In the case of children's garden and crippling sites, she has already made contact with a local facility.
And whatever she wants, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here as soon as possible - and get to know the most beautiful jogging trails of the Red Valley.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled with 20 percent for the start of the season in the case of a fan-back.
"Because of the remote system that is mandatory, we plan to maintain with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," said Borussia Dortmund's Managing Director Carsten Cramer.
Usually, the arena takes over 81,000 spectators in the Riviera at the Bundesliga games.
In the spirit games of last season caused by the Corona pandemic, BVB per party lost about four million euros.
The BVB responsible for marketing, digitisation and internationalisation hopes that, in addition to the normal sights, some of the approximately 4000 places in the hospitality area can be reopened: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues are completely removed".
In view of the continuing Corona crisis, all of us are "well advised to take a stable side length for the first time".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are alone in short work in Germany, then the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer said.
The Dortmund Marketing-Chief praised the BVB-profession for its pay gap, which is intended to contribute to overcoming the crisis: "Of course, players know that its pay gap has a different effect than when we put 100 people working in marketing."
Winzy Wonders: Early start in life with a few hundred grams
Almost harder than a packerl butter, just once three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The bub is one of about 400 fruits that are cared for annually at the Grazer Children's Clinic.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme light weights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and so early that neither lung, intestine, or muscle are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so dirty that they could damage the electrodes of an EKG.
And they're so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and specially made mini-tapes for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be with voice - "and how," smunzelt Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even though of course they don't scream as loud as big babies."
When the Whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona Theatre in the classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage had just begun the 9th classes of the St. James gymnasium in Abtsgmünd.
Artist Julia Sylvester from the theatre of the city of Aalen presented to the students the production "The Home Dress" - and even by video.
After that, the students were able to exchange with the actor and director Winfried Tobias about the piece and performance via Skype.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the scope of the teaching.
Even if all the participants agreed at the conclusion that the direct meeting in the theatre and stage room would offer additional travel, the theater also sees the potential for contact in the schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the gaming operation," stressed director Winfried Tobias.
First round: The TSV 1860 would meet in the DFB Pokal on Entracht Frankfurt
If the TSV 1860 is qualified for the DFB Pokal, the lions meet in the first round at Entracht Frankfurt.
This resulted in the discharge on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty potential opponents are stuck in the first round of the DFB Pokal.
The lions would meet with a successful qualification at the entrance of Frankfurt.
This resulted in the release on Sunday evening at the ARD sports show.
Because because of the Corona pandemic the participation field is not yet complete, the release of space holders came to be used.
The TSV 1860 is already at the end of the Bavarian Toto Pokal (4 or 5 September).
There the lions meet either on the Würzburger Kickers or Victoria Ashharenburg.
If Würzburg's secondary climber reached the finish, sixty would already be qualified for the first round in the DFB pool.
Otherwise, the Giesinger had to implement itself in the final game against Regionalligist Ashharenburg.
The first round of the DFB Pokal will be held between September 11th and 14th and a week before the third start.

Three years later the award came as the best actress in William Wylers "The Heirness" (The Erbin).
She was also given a lot of recognition as a neurotic eccentrician in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Grube".
Daphne du Maurier proposed her role in filming her novel "My Cousine Rachel" in 1952.
The piece has been a worldwide success.
With her long-year-old friend Bette Davis, she played in "Biegenlied for a Body".
From marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953), the son of Benjamin emerged.
In Paris de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage is broken, too.
Sounds about an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Tole/Wickler miss Finals at Comeback
The WM Second Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the finals at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the Top Teams in Düsseldorf, they subpoena their national teammates Nils Ehlers and Lars flights with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Last year, Thole/Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September last year.

Kalbitz draft from AFD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AFD is in the view of the FDP only a "tape sheet" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the legal extremities in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the peak of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said the FDP Internal Policyman Benjamin Strasser of the News Agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday after several hours of negotiations, the AFD’s Federal Court of Justice had confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which was decided by the Federal Board in May by majority.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in Brandenburg Landtag.
"If the AFD really were to remove right-wing extremists consistently from their party, officials such as Björn Höcke and his followers would have been excluded for a long time," said Strasser.
"There is, however, no political will in the AfD, because law extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said: "Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, says nothing and changes nothing," he said the "World on Sunday".
"It speaks more of bonds than many frenetic supporters have a right extremist in the middle of the AFD."
Blume assumes that the AFD will be re-established in elections in the future by five percent.
"The days of the AfD in Parliament are numbered."
Kalbitz was one of the speakers of the currently officially dissolved "flights" around the Thuringian AfD-land and Group Chairman Björn Höcke; the protection of the Constitution suspends the passage as a "secured right-wing attempt".
In May, the AfD Federal Executive Board threw Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason he stated, Kalbitz did not give a prior membership in the currently prohibited legal extremism "Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans at his party's entry.
Kalbitz contests membership in HDJ.
Also, the president of the Left Group in the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, stressed that the decision of the Federal Court of Justice does not change anything in the nature of the AFD: "The Wolf has only smelled cride.
The AFD remains a right-wing party, whether with or without calbitz".
This decision neither weakens the Federal Party nor weakens the right wing.
"The manoeuvre of the Mäthen-Truppe is transparent.
A further observation is to be made by the protection of the Constitution and is trying to get under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD will not release the spirits that called her.
There is no change in the draft," said SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn in Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD-Landes Association and the Group remained their right leader to this day."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AFD will continue.
This announced on Saturday that he will now act civilly against the decision of the Federal Court of Justice.
North Sea Windparks deliver good 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, the wind power plants on the German North Sea have fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the network.
These are well 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet shared in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea current to mainland and the transmission through the German power grid.
The winds on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's network area, have consumed another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind current from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea comes to 13,73 TWh, compared to good 11,64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The windmill on the lake thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany; these are about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind parks provide higher production capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy comes in addition to the wind conditions from higher production capacities, as new wind parks have gone online in the last 12 months.
If the 1270 wind turbines in the North Sea were all running at the same time with full force, they could generate a 6.7 gigawatt power.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; it is based on Tennet at 7.1 gigawatt.
By 2030 it will rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands we invest up to 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections," said Tennet CEO Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind parks can't even use their capacity on lakes, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2 when the North Sea Windparks generated more than six gigawatt power.
On average, the North Sea windmills produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatt power, corresponding to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Kunst Verein Gmünder.
It was almost a little anniversary celebration at 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold blew the usual frame after the Corona break.
Much more art friends than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Art Association, Professor Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent delivered the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern corner.
In the northern part of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether".
Free: Windbergfest for Corona discounted
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people visited this city festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and - in consciousness, how difficult it is for the participants - hoped for until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (partileos).
"But finally, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here."
For if tens of thousands of people had flocked to the mainland and to the mainland, minimum conditions, hygiene regulations and a follow-up to contact could not be complied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring burden would increase disproportionately over a number of times.
Rumberg won next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100-year-old existence, inter alia, with the winter festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of the Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressur-Olympiaster Werth not to beat in Achleiten
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic winner Isabel Werth was the outstanding rider at the Dresssur tournament in the Austrian Achleitten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four wins at the weekend.
After she had won a Grand Prix each for the occasion with Christmas and Quantaz, she was also not to beat on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the kitchen.

The Germans were also in the kitchen on Saturday on Quantaz, clear from her 34 year old student Victoria Max-Thourer.
Werth's victory horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Thourer.
The world's most successful hairdresser is to establish the ten-year-old hanging in the Grand Prix.
It was the first cup for Quanta.
At the first tournament in Achleite three weeks ago, Werth had won all the major four tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is planned for August 14th to 16.
More airplanes in Worms in the future
The Wormser University continues to fly: The "DFS German Aviation Insurance" establishes a professorship for Air Traffic Management.
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The Treaty was first concluded for three years and started in 2021.
With the professor, there is the possibility to allow the start of the study not only in the summer, but also for the winter semester.
As a result, as many students can be trained twice as ever.
At the same time, the capacities are evenly charged both at the university and at the Air Safety Academy of the DFS.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and establishment of the Professor.
Presented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been trained to fly to the University of Worms in the Air Traffic Management course.
This year, nine students started.
So far, the experience of the DFS is very positive, the performance of the students is excellent.
The combination of study and loten training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the loten profession.
"In these times, the promotion is not easy for us.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and to grow again in the long term.
In order to meet our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Schürle, CEO of the DFS when signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the foundation professorship is a future-proof investment, which will provide the fleets with a broad, professionally comprehensive knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue to cooperate well with the university and at the same time undermine our attractiveness as an employer."
Professor Jens Hermsdorf, president of the University of Worms, also underlines this: "The foundation professorship is an important bridge between science and economics.
With them we would like to join the existing cooperation with the DFS German Aviation Insurance as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor study Air Traffic Management."
The confidence of German aviation insurance is also a motivation and obligation for the University of Worms to further expand their teaching and research skills in the fields of future air transport.
In use for tomorrow's Flyers, the university with the first foundation professor for a dual course of study can place very special highlights and innovative focus for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Further Education and Culture, stresses: "The University of Worms has a unique feature in the field of air transport in Rheinland-Pfalz with its focus.
Today's signature of the Cooperation Treaty strengthens the profile of the university."
Rescue helicopter landing on the A 45
Around 30 minutes the A 45 motorway was completely closed on Saturday afternoon towards Aschenburg, as after a traffic accident the rescue screwdriver was in use.
A 76-year-old drove with a ford at 12.40 p.m. in the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the curve and landed at the guideboard.
Through the spray, the front airbags dissolved, the driver suffered slight injuries in the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old companion were provided by the doctor and the patient fled to a hospital in conjunction with the rescue guard.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no danger of life.
The damaged vehicle, in which a damage of approximately EUR 2000 had to be removed, had to be removed.
Heil wants to examine other sectors according to the meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry back to light.
Law-enforcement is just ahead.
But they're on the right side - and it's gonna stay there?
Federal Minister for Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors, in accordance with the strict rules currently planned against meat industry irregularities.
"We will look at industry and then take appropriate measures for each industry if necessary," said Heil der Deutschen Presse-Agenture in Berlin.
Germany's employer is already warning to limit work contracts in general.
After the massive outbreak of Corona during the meat-crushing tonnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
In the case of slaughter, slaughter and meat processing, large-scale slaughterhouses shall no longer be allowed to employ foreign personnel.
It is intended to prohibit the use of workers' contracts and leasers.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said that the dpa said, "Finger away from a general restriction on labour contracts and overtime, if the economy is not completely destroyed."
For example, works contracts are for wide areas of the handicraft, construction industry and plant construction, requiring the basis for their value creation with the customer.
"The faults of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My aim is not to prohibit work contracts anywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts were meaningful.
"If an industrial company is commissioned to build a safety facility, it is a very normal work contract."
The German meat industry has a ban on works contracts and leasing in its industry for constitutional purposes alone.
It is not possible to explain why, in the future, the processing and packaging of cheese should apply to work rights other than to Wurst, it is in an opinion on the draft legislation, as reported by the "New Osnabrück newspaper" (Saturday).
Thus, in the case of a ban, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 per cent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European workers from labour contracts worked in the industry following the results of an examination of the NRW employment protection administration for 16 hours a day.
Often they didn't have a break.
Wages were reserved for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often unfavourable.
Heil said that a relatively strict law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
But through "triangular constructions" these have been carried out.
"Now, basically, we need to be cleaned up."
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we want to decide at the end of July in the cabinet, there are also measures which not only concern the meat industry - for example, higher testing rates for labour protection or clear criteria for Community shelters".
The present draft includes amendments to the Law on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers more intensive controls necessary.
"I wish we could do more control in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal protection, all possible, for example, animal transport," said Nonnemaker on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg up to date".
However, more staffing is also needed for more controls.
Three dead when crashing ultralight aircraft in Germany

She was taken to Kassel Hospital.
With a thermal camera, the firearm was looking for possible companions.
According to the police on the Bundesstraße 83, the woman was on her way to her place of residence, when her car came from an uncertain cause of the road and crossed over several times.
In order to save the unfortunate, the firearm had to cut off the roof of the apartment.

Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a rescue gate by Cristiano Ronaldo, Record Champion Juventus Turin has won the Italian Championship for the ninth time in the series.
The team around the world's five-time football team made the 36th Skuddto of association history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday night at home against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 a.m.
With 83 points, Turin, which entered without the last long injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, no longer push two days before the season end of the series A from space.
The tablet range Inter Milan is back seven points.
Despite optical superiority in the first half of the day, Ronaldo met with the last action after a release.
An example of Miralem Pjanic earned the 35-year-old from the fine line directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the now offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved at 2:0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67).
This ensured the smooth, but decisive success.
The foulelfmeter sent to the latte in the 89th minute only Ronaldo should have been right in view of the Torjäger rating.
"It is complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are rare, and the moment changes very easily," said Coach Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the spiritual invention of his players was great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the tournaments had not been able to make the championship perfect.
At the end of the period, Juve had to give thanks to the weakness of the competitors in particular.
Because in the eleven parties before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team only won five victories.
Whether Ronaldo is still a Torchus king, it's a question.
Because during the Portuguese superstar reached 31 doors, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has already reached 34 hits on his account at 5:1 (1:1) of the table-turned Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title of the FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín.
In the 2015/2016 season, the Argentinian reached 36 gates for the SSC Naples.
In August, the "Old Lady" of the Italian football is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus is in the eighth final of the Champions League, however, on August 7th against Olympic Lyon has to compete a 0:1 play field in order to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal authors recorded
Stuttgart - All threatened sentences and court rulings to the contrary, drivers on numerous illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg streets continue to be gas: In the last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the Southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal authors.
There are no comparisons for the previous years, but the breeders are doing more work for the judicial authorities: in 2018, in the case of state prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim, 155 investigations were conducted due to illegal races, one year later there were 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
There were fewer organised events in the race, as the Ministry of the Interior responded to a request from the country day-spD.
In most cases, the drivers were spontaneous, or they would have taken the flight before the police - this is also shown as illegal races.
The tax was mainly for German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 Penalties - 15 times imprisonment
Only in a few cases are the breeders obtained and also prayed for the cash: According to the Ministry of the Interior, 113 fines have been suspended since 2018 and 15 sentences have been pronounced.
However, there are no indications that the number of illegal authors is actually increasing.
Many other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the various tragic accidents and processes of the past years and showed more frequent signs, said a ministry speaker.
Especially popular with Rasern is the motorway 8. Car drivers always brake out there again and again to make room and use the free route for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were acquired near Kirchheim under a check, three months before there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Marklingen.
A81 is the most popular race track
On A81, the police even register more races than on any other federal highway.
With a Tempolimite, the breeders are tried to break through the particularly affected section between branches and branches.
Most of the high-priced sports and luxury carooses often have Swiss marks because the drivers have to move to Germany due to the high penalties for too fast driving and car racing in neighboring countries.
For the SPD, the Tempolimit can not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general Tempolimit of 130 hours we would create this problem on highways from the body," says Martin River, the transport experts of the SPD-Landtags fraction.
"The brake threshold for the breeder would be significantly higher if you weren't here and there still legally with 200 hours and more on the way."
From enlightenment or image campaigns, the Rivoire has less: "He who moves in this way over all the rules and not only his own life, but also the life of other road users, is hardly yet attainable with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police intervention
On the other hand, ADAC does not seem enough: "We assume that Rasser does not get scared of the tempolimits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also stronger controls on the routes concerned.
Not often, from the high-speed force fairs are painful and serious: since January 2019 and by April 2020, three people have died in the race, two of which are not involved in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's downtown town and one in Gerlingen.
There two young men were supposed to have delivered an author in November.
One of the vehicles came out of the street, went against a garden wall and stayed on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people have been injured in the race of the past two years.
However, in the view of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, more severe penalties are not necessary: "legislative action is required to punish illegal motor vehicles more severely," says the Ministry of Interior paper.
Bluelight of July 23rd: Durable Breakers Stolen Drinks From Imbis
Rohrdorf: On Thursday, a man in Rohrdorf (Kreis Calw) broke into an imbis and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noise at 3.40 p.m. in the valley street and walked toward the Imbisia.
There he noticed a man who served with drinks at the fridge and left the Imbis at the end of a previously opened entrance.

The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black cap, black pants, and bright shoes.
Further evidence is against the police.
Ackermann sprints for victory at the final stage at Sibiu Tour
Radprofi Pascal Ackermann won his second day victory at the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old pälzer from the Bora-hansgrohe team was established on the 109 km long section with start and goal in Hermannstadt in the mass print after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the season wins three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall evaluation, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger was involved.
The 26-year-old had sovereignly chosen the mountain-time journey for himself in the morning and thus took the tops of the class.
Only 104 drivers attended the final stage in the evening.
Not less than 18 beginners fell victim to the time limit in the mountain season.
"I'm really happy to start the season-new with a victory," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
"The Sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters before the target, he just pulled his sprint, "and it also hit perfectly".
According to the rules of the World Association UCI, a corona test was carried out with all participants and their associates six days before the start of the race.
During the complete round trip, drivers and operators were separated from the organisation team and from the media in isolated hygiene blasts.
Viewers of start and target were not allowed.
Leader gave instructions to layout reanimation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.

Nuremberg: Unauthorized Tuning Meeting - Police take over, 700 vehicles and about 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and over 1,000 people occasionally took part in a "tuning meeting" on the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police announced that such events should be monitored more closely.
At a large Tuning meeting, it came to Nuremberg Southstadt on Saturday (July 25, 2020).
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police, at 22.30 p.m., an increase in vehicle turnover in the area of a large parking area in Ingolstadt Street was detected by the Nuremberg Transport Police.
The police then carried out a number of vehicle checks.
The police had recently announced that they wanted to proceed more strongly against so-called autoposers.
Illegal Tuning Meetings in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers included good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police balance.
However, it was only a small part of the "autoposer" and tuning scene to be assigned.
Apparently, most of the scene in question came to the police's appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons on the ground, this was mainly the case for skilful persons.
In addition, the majority of those present remained in the current rules on protection of infection, in particular the compliance with minimum standards and the wearing of oral nasal protection.
The checks carried out on the spot were completed at 1:00 p.m.
In total, the officials of 10 vehicles have identified such a change in construction that the operating permit has been abolished.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No author
There were no illegal authors.
"The Presidency of the Central Bank will continue to keep an eye on the situation and will continue to carry out enhanced control measures, including in the context of the appearance of spectators," it said.
The Agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the participating divestment company: "They have all the beautiful fields that we must not discount," said Schrödinger.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company should be careful not to cause any damage.
"The young people are supposed to keep their cars unharmed."
Number of employment agencies: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-term employment
Berlin - The Federal Labour Agency (BA) claims that about 900 suspected cases of abuse will be reported in the short term.
"This is extremely small in the case of more than 880,000 companies that have shown short work," said the board responsible for the business Daniel Terzenbach of the "Frankfurter General Zeitung".
When at the beginning of the Corona crisis many companies had suddenly applied for short-term work, the BA had to respond quickly.
Usually the test takes up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available in this hot phase.
More precisely, we will look at the conclusions.
I'm sure there'll be a few more.
We are not naive and have a long breath."
Indications of abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA Analysis software is used to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency wave in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvents than in the previous year?
The estimates go together, but we are fighting for the case and we are already training our employees in the working agencies to process applications for insolvency money."
Still, the numbers were infallible, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the new garden.
The assembly was dissolved at 8:48 p.m. by the rectors of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the Foundation informed on PNN request.
The young people would have left the park after that.
On Saturday evening, some young people in the New Garden had played Rugby.
The Wiese has been cleared by reciergs, SPSG spokesperson Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
There's always going to be illegal holidays in the parks
In the parks of the Foundation there are always collections where the distance and hygiene rules are not complied with the Covid-19 Implementing Regulation.
At the end of June it was a celebration with about 300 people in the Park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people in the New Garden celebrated.
Even without a corona regulation, the parks are closed when the darkness breaks.
The camp on the meadows is prohibited according to parking arrangements, there are only a few exceptions.
The Foundation has long complained that visitors would leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties reached another dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the Neukölln district, on Sunday night 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests for Corona break-out in tourist destination
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a Corona outbreak in the popular Austrian tourist resort St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as reported by the national authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still in the evening.
Thus, many of the infected young practitioners are in tourism, but at least a holiday guest has been tested positively.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday night.
The clock was set at 23 o'clock.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there" of bookings, said the head of the Association of Tourism Wolfsagreee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Also, individual guests have to leave early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are German.
On Friday, the first infections were publicly known.
On Saturday, the head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behaviour of practitioners who had celebrated in several places and could have burned down there.
"We all liked doing this in our youth," he told the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourist Association launched an information campaign to sensitize young employees for the dangers of Covid-19.

The focus of the new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.

Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against the leader of Netanyahus have become more and more violent.
There have been violent disputes in the night.
On Sunday night in Jerusalem, the Israeli police took action against the participants in a demonstration against the legally conservative leader Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in unrest, police spokesperson Mickey Rosenfeld shared.
The police set up water towers, among other things, in order to solve the news.
In total, about 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahus Amtsitz after media reports on Saturday night.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanjahu's dealings with the Corona crisis.
The Protestants shook drums, broke in horns, and called Netanyahu to retreat.
It was also that participants in a counter-test were arrested, who supported Netanjahu, reported the news page "ynet".
Also in many other places in Israel, demonstrated people, including in front of the private villa of the chief government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested after police reports near Tel Aviv because he is suspected of having sprayed from a driving car Pepperspray on demonstrators on the road.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protestor in the south of the country.
The demonstration was slightly injured on the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The announcements accompany the corruption process against the Government.
At last Netanyahu was also criticised for his handling of the Corona crisis.
He is provided with early closures and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has made the economy of the country difficult.
The unemployment rate was at last more than 20 per cent.
The number of new infections with the Corona virus in Israel has recently risen to new record values.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter forces on car - nine injured - Ruhrbeite - Bild.de
Ahlen - An accident on Saturday afternoon at B58 at Ahlen called for nine minor injuries.
A driver was traveling with her two children (3,5) towards Beckum.
The police said, "Perhaps she had stopped suddenly because she wanted to bend."
That must have been the driver of a Mercedes transporter who had seen too late behind her.
He hit the back of the car.
In the case of the accident, three inmates were easily injured in the car and six in the carrier.
Several rescue cars took them to a nearby hospital.
North Korea controls the border city after Corona suspicion
North Korea has so far seen a "lighting success" in its own measures to defend the Corona virus.
Now, for the first time, the country reports a suspicion.
Because of a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely destroyed a major city in fear of a disaster.
Despite the most severe epidemiological resistance in the past six months, "the evil virus could have been absorbed into the country," state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the emergency situation has been suspended.
The Communist leadership called out the highest alarm level.
If the suspicion is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the affected country.
North Korea had not registered a single infection, according to its own data, and described its resistance as "lighting success".
The data were dubious abroad.
The disease symptoms were reported by an "outer" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person moved to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the crossing of the border within the four kilometres wide and mostly still intended military buffer zone, there was first no confirmation from South Korea.
However, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military seized the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
This led to studies with some people.
North Korea called for its own statements on Saturday because of the suspicion of an emergency meeting of the Labour Party Police Office chaired by Power Manager Kim Jong Un.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster".
Kim has already arranged as a preventive measure on Friday to "block Kaesong completely and isolate every area and region from others", it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had contact with them, were placed under quarantine.
The Central Military Commission of the Party should therefore examine the "outbreak" and the conduct of the responsible military unit and, where appropriate, impose a severe penalty.
In Kaesong, about 300,000 people live according to estimates.
Tension before the Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still before a great summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental themes, the members of the assembly will also vote on the building plan for the major project of urban development east," says the city press release on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 p.m. in the conference center Pforzheim Grand Hall.
Above all, the evaluation of the eastern city will be discussed until the end of the controversy.
The majority are hardly, lastly, even denying the presence of individual committees.
An appeal from the economy (Building, Real Estate, Trade and IT), which is out of citizenship and then a project developed by the administration and community, has now not lost preparation after almost ten years, criticised project opponents Reinhard Klein as "an extra-parliamentary opposition", "unawareness", "speculation", "speculation" and "conscious false accusations".
"All I think it's better to know," said Little, who has been one of the only representatives of the Pforzheim list of citizens for a year.
In fact, after reading the contracts in this position, he said, "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit will make the city cheaper, the Technical Council is opposed to the municipal administration's statements of grants, from which little is convinced, to heal for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop very differently from being predicted in the councilhouse and by the supporters of the economy.
The city was designed by its own power and not by an investor: the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also provides essentially the repair of the Technical Councilhouse, the opening of the Schloßberg, the rental of the Ex-Thale for administrative areas and a smaller urban transformation in the ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental themes play a central role
In addition, especially environmental themes will play a central role.
This is how the municipality will, among other things, vote on the noise plan.
This includes a number of measures to protect the Pforzheim population against health noise loads caused by road traffic, including numerous temperature reductions.
In a press release, the German transport club welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of this because they have contributed only to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the noise, as the VCD, by neglecting the line bus traffic with extended speeds and by lack of commitment to wheel traffic.
The municipality also agrees on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
The agenda also includes the accession of Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishment of parents' contributions to the city's children's day-care facilities and the application for admission to the federal Smart City Foundation.
Citizens are welcome, but corona protection measures must be approved.
With a lot of delay Tim Zimmermann starts in the new season
With almost half a year of delay, Tim Zimmermann starts his first season in ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the supersport car league can take up the regular operation, the first test rides were stopped.
For Zimmermann, it was especially important to get to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 more closely.
The Corona crisis has for a long time prevented Tim Zimmermann from attacking his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan by Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first rounds on the Lausitz ring and was able to get used to his premieres in the GT3 car.
"There are already some things that are different from the Porsche from the preseason," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS you have to go to the curves, for example.
But it really made a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his first 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Netherlands has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I am not a beginner in motor sports, but every new series brings new challenges with it," Zimmermann says.
"Steijn and I understand us blindly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - at the Lauistzring - the GT Masters will also draw his first race.
From July 31, the 33 supersport cars will be raced by the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, one of 15 series-news, knows the route.
In 2015 he was the last guest in the Motodrom.
"It worked fast and I had to get used to a little on the track," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"Lausitzring has many fast passports that you need to meet optimally to be fast."
As soon as the roomman is real, it turns out in two weeks.
"The teams, of course, poker a little at the tests," he says.
"In conclusion, however, we are very pleased and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tight-pressed calendar.
By the beginning of November, seven races are on.
The momentary stand is that no viewer will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring Ex-Formel-1-Pilot Niko Hülkenberg will reach the GT link.
British Minister for Transport of Quarantine Decision
According to press reports, the British government's decision to put Spanish holidaymakers under quarantine for two weeks after their return has cooled the country's Minister of Transport.
Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues decided on the measure at home on Saturday.
Because of the number of Corona numbers rising again in Spain, the cabinet in London separates the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine.
The new regulation applies today, Sunday, so that Shapps will also have to return to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rules apply to those who are only on holiday on Saturday, August 1st, and were not introduced overnight.
Spain is still considered to be one of the "safer countries" in Austria, for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Many ministers should have known in the past that there is a possibility that a quarantine for vacationers in Spain will be suspended," said Labour Deputy Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has made the effort to say Grant Shapp's message."
Almost a month after the end of the Corona situation in Spain and the expiry of the strict exit barrier, the number of infections in the country is increasing again.
In particular, virologists make nightlife responsible for the new spread.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday countries in Britain.
From unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, the British government currently advises that the canaries and Balearicians especially popular for British holidayers are exempt from this.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the new Corona virus and more than 28,000 deaths have been reported in Spain.
Russia: Marine Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a warship equipment with the most modern hyper-signalling weapons on the day of the Navy in his country.
With these one-time weapons in the world, the possibilities of the Russian maritime forces would be expanded, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central Marine Parade.

They are considered weapons of the future.
Subwater tropodeo is further built
It will continue to be built at the underwater torpedo Poseidon, which is also used in the atom.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself also sailed with a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service in the individual fleet associations of the largest country of the earth.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Russian Navy has been a reliable protector, Putin said on the day celebrated by Matrosen.
In many other Russian coastal areas, the sea forces begin the day of the Marine with parades.
In Syria, where Russia fights on the side of Power Master Baschar al-Assad, the military demonstrated at a gun show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus Stronge.
There was also ammunition fired.
In a video published by the Ministry of Defence, not only were warships, including a U-boat, but also battleships and jets.

Evacuees called for caution
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," said Abbott, according to the newspaper Houston Chronicle.
With a view to the storm in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is even reinforced when you consider that it is being hit by an area that is the strongest area in the federal state of Covid-19."
According to Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died alone in Texas as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be careful.
They should not miss practices "on which we have become accustomed", such as wearing masks, the Governor said according to the CBS envoy.
It was important that all the distances were kept.
Therefore, hotel rooms have also been provided in some places.
It is also intended to be tested on Corona in emergency cases.
Damages were first reported only from the coastal city of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn
At wind speeds of up to 150 kilometres per hour, "Hanna" according to official data on the island of Padre Island was directly hit on land by the Texas coast.
The tropical storm was previously one of the lowest levels in the Hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flow warning was first issued and was later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening, while "Hanna" continued to drag into the interior of the country and drive to the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific Hurricane "Douglas" was on Sunday night with wind speeds of about 150 kilometres per hour towards Hawaii.
The Hurricane Centre, however, expected him to slow down further.
According to the forecast, it should be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (placetime) - then as a storm just below the Hurricane Cloud.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an over-average active Hurricane season in May this year.
From June to the end of November, the Authority had explained that up to 10 hurricanes could become very strong storms.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
In view of the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, which an average even ten percent, was then called.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government was watching the storms and was in contact with the affected states.

Sassuolos Filip Djuricicic was just two doors known
Naples - Four doors achieved, four doors unknown: Sassuolo Calcio experienced at 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football league Series A amber night - and was quite angry at the video assistants of the referendum.
"A festival not given to Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so hard on a team," commented the Corriere dello Sport.
Hoster Naples was led by a gate of external defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32nd minute, Philip Djuricic first cheered the compensation.
The Video Assistant Reference (VAR) took the hit back because of a remote position.

FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparatory phase for the Champions League began for Double-Sier FC Bayern with a backlog.
After a short vacation and a few days of training, Hansi Flick has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of World Champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, behind Captain Manuel Neuer and Midfield Chief Joshua Kimmich, has the third most minutes of use, suffers a tape damage to the left footroot and threatens to miss out on decisive royal-class duels.
In the Munich Schmuddel Weather, the lawyer broke off a training game and was driven out of the square with a golf card.
How long the unrestricted tribal player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A deployment in the eight-final game against FC Chelsea on August 8th may be difficult, and the 24-year-olds may hope for the final tournament starting on August 12th in Lisbon.
The Bayers do not want to stop from mismanaging from training on Sunday.
Flick called in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to the capital of Portugal.
Quality, intensity and concentration are expected to show its starring title collection in the 28 days to the King's class final on August 23.
"We have simply mastered the duties with Mastership and Pokal.
Now it's worth creating the special thing," said Flick.
Until the Munich can deal specifically with the final tournament and before a training camp at the Algarve, the eight-final obligation against FC Chelsea is the first time.
After 3:0 in the example before the Corona break, the Londoners in the home are not supposed to be like the lost "finale dahoam" in 2012 again to the Bavarian dream.
"We have to go through the door for the first time.
We want to win, create good conditions and trust tanks with a good game," asked Flick.
A test for vote will be held on Friday against the Olympic Marseille.
With a long address, Flick had sworn his stars after the Double 13 days of vacation on a single August.
31 Players he welcomed on the Säbener Street, including the new players for the precious purchase of Leroy Sané, who first met all the new colleagues in the square after his shift from Manchester City.
"Leroy has put up good like all the new ones," said Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season, if Sané & Co. can't just coach anymore, Flick spoke much better about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, it is now being trained in team strength for the Londoners, who are unlike the Flick ensemble in the playhythms.
After that, the Munichns could face a quarter-final against the FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, which are possible opponents of Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin.

At the tournament with Neuner's crews, it was also jealous of the matter on Sunday.
Of the performers, all were also the immigrant Thiago and David Alba, whose stay is not secured beyond the royal class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to cut off its world master
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA must improvise to give the WM title.
All American races have been canceled.
Running calendars are becoming more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season takes on further shape.
Three further race routes were added to the 10 Grand Prix confirmed so far.
In October, the Nürburgring will take place in Germany and Portugal.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. fought on the Italian tradition line in Imola around WM points.
This includes the 2020 run calendar according to current status 13 runs.
"We are pleased that we will continue to make great progress in the completion of our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula 1 Boss Chase Carey.
In total, 15 to 18 races in the royal class of motor sport are to be completed during this extraordinary season.
The Formula 1 wants to complete its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the officially targeted races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports could still take place in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulation requires running on three continents
The regulation of Formula 1 requires at least three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even if, as is currently planned, only two continents will run, there will be a world champion.
By means of a special rule, the FIA intends to give the title under "extraordinary circumstances" because of the Corona virus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cut short due to the impending Corona crisis.
A return to the continent is not yet a topic this year.
In addition, formula 1 will not be hosted in America this year.
Debate breaks down in Brazil on criticism
Because of the strained Corona situation, the races in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
"We are looking forward to being with them again in the next season," Carey explained.
The American race's rejection was particularly critical in Brazil: "The rejection did not come as a surprise to us, but the reasons for it cannot be accepted," said Tamas Rohonyi, a promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Thus, the number of infections in the São Paulo area was significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would also not justify the rejection.
You should be prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad view of Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg talked about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest at Stephen Colbert's famous latenight show during the video chat and gave her what she had in her head at her meeting with Donald Trump.
Climate researcher Greta Thunberg was per video switch to guest in a popular US-Latenight show.
She related, among other things, her fight against the mighty of the world.
Also about her famous "bad view" at her meeting with Donald Trump, the teenager spoke.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has been paying attention to her tireless use of the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke on her plans in the future in a well-known latenight show, as well as her meeting with President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Lateight moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your mission and conducted a longer interview with Sweden.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change but also about her conflict with the mighty of the world.
"There are some things that have surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to get the focus away from the climate crisis," she has shrugged.
"All from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children are going on the street" she experienced.
Heads of state and leading politicians who ridicule them in social media or even try to silence them, they find themselves "slow" because they show their reactions "because they have no other answer to them".
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed on a famous scene in which she threw a bitter look behind her.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the Aktvistin sailed across the Atlantic, its powerful view of the cameras has been captured and seen since by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip created a GIF, an animated image that eventually became one of the most frequently used images for Trump generators.
But what did the 17-year-olds think about the U.S. president at the time?
Stephen Colbert answered the relatively open question only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that need any further explanation."
With the successful response, the experienced satiric Colbert had probably not figured out and disappeared in a short time laughing from the picture.
With her "How there you?" talk about the principles of climate protection, she kept many in mind at the climate conference.

Fleetwood Mac Founder Peter Green died
His life was like a backtrack: After a swift climb with Fleetwood Mac it went steeply up and then slowly up again.
Now the Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genial guitarist, drug junkie, cult trailer: The co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully at the age of 73 in bed, family members shared an official opinion on Saturday, a further opinion would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton valued Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the Fleetwood Mac band.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had established the longest legendary band in 1967 in London, to this day unforgettable is his dreamal instrumental hit "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") is just a backtrack.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated its greatest success then without it.
There should have been a dispute, among other things, because Green wanted all the winnings of the group for charitable purposes.
He began to appear in wide walls and with a large crucifix.
Psychic problems should also have played a role.
Three years after the foundation, Green left the band in 1970.
There was a social decline.
The Bluesrock guitarist is suffering from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographs reported.
For a long time Green was treated in the psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musicians disappeared from the screen.
He was to live on the street on time, working as a peacekeeper and spent a long time in an Israeli kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as a son of a Jewish worker family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
As a young man, he was fascinated by American blue musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
When he was 11 years old, he learned the first guitar lessons.
At the age of 15, the teen began playing professional guitar and got five years later the chance to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the Peter B's Louners instrument band.
A little later, he was hired as a replacement for his Idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the Blues Boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green protected the group in winter 1968/69 the first number 1 hit and catapulted it at the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed his shadow pages: Green did not force the media, his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
The life between music and search he later commented in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in my life is drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit."
By the end of the decade, Green achieved a surprising success with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac then swam without it in a new formation on a successful wave.
Her 1977 album "rumours" sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not achieve any greater comeback until he started again with a group of friendly musicians in 1996.
The British "Daily Telegraph" then spoke of a rock star that returned to the earth.
Free of drugs Green released some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band broke up in 2004.
For music experts he was already a blue legend - and with his soft sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
