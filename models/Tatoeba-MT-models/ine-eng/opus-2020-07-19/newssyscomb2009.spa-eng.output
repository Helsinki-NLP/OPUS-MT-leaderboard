Right populist triumph in Austria, together constitute 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, an appreciable weakening of both sides of the current great coalition and an express strengthening of the party of the right-wing populist.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People's Party (ODP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously affected.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphal return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 per cent vote, so it loses 5.5 per cent vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still, the WFP has finished losing 25.6 per cent, almost nine per cent of votes.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war and especially for the people who called these early elections.
At the beginning of July, when the WFP came out of the coalition, the populace had a considerable advantage in relation to preference to the SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for letting the government shipwreck.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations were made on the resignation of the party president and, to this day, vice-canceller, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be achieved this Monday at the exceptional meeting of the Party's presidency.
This would, of course, facilitate the path of the constant and closer starting point of the electoral results, i.e. the renewal of the great coalition between the SPO and the ODP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both parties to the right of the populist - liberals (FPO) have won approximately 18 per cent and the BZO, one eleven per cent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same year 1999 would be the same when the populars negotiated with the populists (the FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it was demised by the BZO) for a coalition government that had come to generate a sanctions by the European Union.
For this evolution, it is clear that Haider has already announced that he is prepared to collaborate with any party and that he has already taken his return to Vienna, to national policy.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament, although it has lost slightly and descended from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the limit of four per cent and therefore is not part of Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India can cool down
If the problem of the Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting scarves could not be solved, the Czech-India relations could be frozen, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This was how the minister in New York manifested himself, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this was not solved then yes, then it would certainly reach this cooling," he noted after the meeting organized by the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive can hardly be put in legal matters.
However, it demonstrated that in the case of Petr Švácha, which was exempted from prosecution and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local Darjiling government in whose jurisdiction the matter is concerned.
"Your problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest courts.
He then asked for an exemption from the case and waited for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"I advise you to appeal to the Supreme Court and then the pardon would be possible," said the Czech Diplomacy Chief.
The only way the Czech party can enter the case is by obtaining a "legally competent support" for the convicted person, the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support had already been obtained by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg commented.
On the other hand, as the ČTK said, his colleague insisted that the Czech Republic consider the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it a tremendous mistake to incarcerate and condemn these Czech scientists," he announced.
The Minister omitted the answer to the question whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
"I've got enough promises," he just said.
A Czech arbitration a battle in the seabed
I'm approaching an electronic wall map, it represents Australia surrounded by sea.
He does not care, however, about the continent but about a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it also the seabed surrounding it.
At the same time, the region is as large as a single continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the United Nations Division for Ocean Law and the Sea.
Your boss, Director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this talent and enthusiasm for work.
The sea background hides up to this day a world unknown, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms still carry the key to the development of medicines against cancer.
The bottom is bigger than the solid land
Coastal countries today have begun to wreak havoc on the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, these enjoy the rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is essentially the so-called Continental Border, which sometimes extends to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
Under the Treaty, this has exclusive rights in all the resources of the Continental Border.
"Only by the continental border is the part of the seabed and its surface, which is a natural continuation of the continent under the water.
It reaches the coast of the sea, and often, to the border of the two hundred miles of the sea, i.e., pure economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the delimitation of the external borders of the continental border must be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a number of years of work preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal assistance committee.
The Commission has so far submitted five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries have come forward," Mikulka added.
Not long ago, Australia's success had a global impact as it was the first that substantially expanded its marine domain.
However, it was also achieved by New Zealand - the seabed area that the commission gave him last week was 1.6 million square kilometers, that is, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of pains for their study.
The profit that will be deducted from the use of the seabed will, as promised, be invaluable.
Other states are also presenting their requests gradually.
They have been able to do so for up to ten years since they ratified the Montego Bay Treaty.
Wherever the continental border ends, the region of the ocean fund declared by the Treaty as "common heritage of humanity" begins.
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is governed by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is not a gold mine," says Director Mikulka with emphasis adding "that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its contractually defined regime."
Czechs in the Pacific
And today, a part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This achieved it in 1991 with a Treaty as investors the same as other few states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to operate in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is something bigger than the old Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is an accident, it's something like a marine replica of the Tatras.
"A total area of 75,000 square kilometres can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concretion.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which, according to legend, revived the Golem.
During the release of hostages, the German special forces command was at the site of action
In order to resolve the hostage crisis, the Egyptian government had requested Germany's assistance - the experts have come.
When the situation was serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are available on the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the rescue action, the German special forces also participated indirectly.
Therefore, in the place of release, the German army specialists as well as GSG 9 officers were on the ground of the federal police aircraft squad, the Federal Criminal Investigation Office, as well as experts in the field of logistics of the technical service.
As ministers' spokesmans reported on Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, aware of a violent liberation, left their prisoners and escaped.
The Government of Egypt accepted Germany's help to use it as support on the ground.
" Luckily it didn't come at that time," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt, the attackers had kidnapped a group of passengers consisting of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a sister as well as her 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in the southern desert region of Egypt, the hostages were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers was unknown until the end as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
As long as the healthy and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the released hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of liberation.
At first, there was no information on their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from the German air forces and arrive to Germany on Tuesday.
The United States House of Representatives does not approve the rescue package
The first chamber of the United States Congress failed very little a large savings package of $700 billion for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very dramatically.
The United States House of Representatives rejected the financial markets package by 227 votes to 206.
Despite all the appeals made by President George W. Bush and former politicians from both sides, there was no majority for the programme with which there should be a limited number of problems in the financial markets.
With dramatic action, the desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the large package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, the leader of the democratic negotiations, had asked Members to vote, although the plan was not so popular.
"It is difficult to get political approval to avoid something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
Already during the vote, the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concerns of investors that the state rescue package could fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious disturbances in the international financial markets.
It is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate in order to allow the programme to enter into force.
Organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the volume of sales of travel bookings for the following months increased compared to last year - even the winter season in more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened situation, the desire to travel from Germany remains as before.
As reported on Monday, the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel reservations for the winter season the travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 per cent more compared to the same period last year.
According to the investigation of the GfK market research institute, reserves for the autumn months had already been raised in numbers.
Thus, the volume of sales of travel agencies in October was almost 11 per cent more than in 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results is GfK figures that are the information analysed on reservations in 1200 travel agencies and calculated approximately for the whole market.
The data collected are the travel reservations made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened course of the dollar, most of all travels to the United States are of great demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
Germany's preferred destination points are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Most of the organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
In view of the increase in energy and food prices, in this case travel costs are "better calculated for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months travel was well reserved, so the volume of sales compared to last year again increased - although according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip, comparing last year, fell.
My first October party
The hits of the parties under the sky open in the endless Balneario, the beer in the jars of a litre and the famous people dressed in traditional bavar costumes by designers.
A debut in a campaign shop.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She's a blonde, the TV moderator and wears a traditional Bavarian suit.
I've got dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is already in use.
But there's one thing that unites us: we're just at the campaign shop, the photographers have already rushed to us and filled their memory cards with photos - it's very lisonary above all because I'm the first time in Octoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian costume seems to fulfill its function.
In fact, as a tourist at the Octoberfest coming from northern Germany, my sense of well-being with a traditional Bavarian dress to this day was still limited.
But after you get to Teresa's Prado, it's not all for that.
Almost everyone wears the traditional Bavarian dress or leather pants; none seems to be a chance or feel unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
I'm the only one who gets a rare look at a banana stand in the chocolate.
A municipality calls my attention to my delantal who had dressed in the wrong way: "the left side is single, the half is the virgin, on the right side is committed, behind is widowed."
Oh, my God, I'm now opening behind the left.
"It's okay," he says laughing.
The others don't worry many of the subtle methods to flirt and carry heads where it's written "To drink to get dressed!" and show them, without asking them, their naked ass.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistly is called Bob, is from England and is also for the first time in October.
It seems to him to be "gorgeous," which speaks with a very long "or."
I realize that after having put your glass next to a liter of beer you just had to drink.
He put it right next to the fire mouth, most think it's a garbage cube.
Then Bob is one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
Others do not have much luck and cannot consume so much alcohol.
At eight o'clock in the night, health care groups run through the place of the party and have to worry about poor drunks.
Sanitaries appear every time in a group - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered steps from one campaign shop to the other.
This works as with most visitors: They arrive sober, return drunks.
There is no one who suffers from alcoholism and is on the move.
"They are the ones who "can't no longer," gave me the answer a health care officer answering my question and disappeared in tumult.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
The 63-year-old infantry who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in the Essex County.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred in Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of neglect.
Since then, he has been released under bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Much before Turkey attempted to be a member of the European Union, the European powers gave way to the desire to penetrate the country.
In the eastern part of Bósphora, perhaps just 20 steps inside Asia, there is one of the most interesting remnants of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, a neo-renacentist style.
At least that's what the guides say.
The building is set to watch the end of the platforms and leads forward two towers, one for each corner, all looking like a typical German town.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a little decade old.
But once the taquila was over, there is no doubt what the size of the company was that this was the most westerly door.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that was cured to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
His ferries were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen frontiers of the Cold War, fell below
the British rule and when the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for the Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 a munitions train exploded by destroying its elaborate roof.
The Turkish sources commented that it was a sabotage.
Since then, the station has been falling apart and has remained on the edge of history.
But today, this railway, entrance door to Anatolia and all the eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's desire to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in the government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen frontiers of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went to a letter and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, expert in foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of shakes, which produced the cadences of the old world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived at the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to rule a new secular state, far from the past of the fall.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamic roots, represents a paradigmal change in Turkish consensus
which has raised some suspicions in the West and, in particular, in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built commercial centers and "power pastries" where middle-class managers in business - men and women -- meet early in the morning to agree to do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he says.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the same time to the East and the West.
It is not one case if it is not towards one or the other.
You have to do both things.
"But certainly at some point," I ask him, "Could Turkey be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he answers, "does not want to face that choice."
He then stressed a point that almost everyone I have spoken to so far had almost read me out of memory: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to the East of Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thinking goes back to the two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East would, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
Then there is no doubt that the continent will have to claim this fascinating country.
Memorable lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: which musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (that, September 11,) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Coro.
As part of the musical project for the city, the following year he founded his magnificent young choir, Proteus.
It is supposed to be for the under 21 years, but at the time the Proteus sang its end in 1979, several of us were finishing the 20 years - we just refuse to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological changing of the forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music that is presented to him, whether Madrigal or Messiah, whether not accompanied or with a complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this choir of young people was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for the music that continued to be absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there in the music.
So you just have to sing!"
His varita was always absolutely clear and precise, although never imposing, nor too flourished.
Whatever was the musical scarf, it always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a knight, this is Vernon Handley.
I met him very well during the two decades he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed over 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I have never, by any means, been disappointed – on the contrary, many times I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had this rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated the drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two war horses very well known throughout the world."
We'll miss you a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his century of William Woodruff (25 September) states that "In 1946 economic history studies were resumed in Oxford and in 1950 he won a research scholarship from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a degree, a master's degree and a doctorate."
This is learned in a note by the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, during which he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 with the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to skip this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Life" because their photographs in black and white, documental style, are fantastic.
They called me attention to their simplicity and the strength they convey, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second assault on the Honda supervents
In November Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of Jazz.
If your predecessor already has a wide habitat, this new monovolume presents an even wider interior space.
This is accompanied by refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz aesthetically presents a very similar line to the resulting model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before examining the new model, it must be noted that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation is introduced into the market.
Therefore, one first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than the one employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, the country where Jazz has been the most commercialized car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Exactly in Japan, about a million Jazz units have been sold since their launch.
The second market has been the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Honda, however, claims that this new Jazz allows to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz units in 2007, the estimates amount to 100,000 cars, which would result in 17% growth in the European market.
In relation to the Spanish market, Honda has traded a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation, managers of the Spanish branch expect to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
It is precisely the arrival of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to much drop sales in Spain.
In fact, brand managers expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 marketed units, which represents 4,000 less than in 2007, a decrease of 16 per cent.
Despite this increase in Honda sales, its market share in Spain has increased, reaching 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to reach 2 per cent in 2010.
To achieve this Honda quota trusts in the arrival of another new model.
This is the Insight, a hybrid of five doors and a compact size - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company expects to trade around 200,000 units a year around the world.
By markets and according to the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the sales of Insight will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once its presentation is made in society in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its quotas.
Its length is up to 3.90 metres (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 metres (two centimeters more) and the distance between axles up to 2.50 metres, which means an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, did not vary and is maintained at 1.52 metres.
Along with the increase in dimensions, it also grows domestic habitat.
This profit is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a central fuel storage facility, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the suitcase - which has a double bottom system - rises to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these measures are of the version with the 1.4 engine, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 suitcase is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as rear lights or the possibility of mounting the panoramic crystal - are an improvement in access to the rear seats.
And the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines in this second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will have two gas propellants of 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Both mechanics incorporate the i-VTEC technology that achieves a lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high pair throughout the engine system.
The first 1.2 litre mechanic gets a power of 90 horses to 6,000 revolutions with a maximum pair of 114 Nm to 4,900 rounds.
This propeller - which Jazz used to reach 78 horses - presents an expenditure of 5.3 liters and a emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
With respect to the previous propeller, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, now becomes 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves combined consumption of 5.4 litres and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'beagle 'car that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for the prevention of Nissan accidents, this time, in nature, in particular, in bees, has been inspired.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking as a basis the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Mark Management Development, BR23C is presented as an extension of the Nissan Security Shield of four areas.
This robot intends to strengthen the ability to prevent collisions of the brand vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own personal space in an oval way that looks much like the Nissan Security Shield.
But the most important are the compound eyes of the bee, capable of seeing with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have designed what a laser tracker (Laser Range Finder) has called.
This detects the obstacles that are up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to a microprocessor of abortion which is immediately translated into the prevention of collision.
"When you detect an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and will immediately change direction by turning its wheels in a straight or larger angle to avoid collision.
The greatest difference with any existing system is that the escape manoeuvre is totally instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," says Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and major engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned upward or downward, or diagonally; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways such as bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act according to that data.
It does not require to store information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB memory.
This may surprise us, but we're not talking about memory gigas, or even megagas."
This is the first step to develop new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan's vaccine will be introduced into serial cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last more than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a satellite GPS navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear before Mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the US Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of fluid to make injections, is not lacking in engineering.
Before the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages in questionable solvency banks, they have created a threatening and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
Either the 'Hotel of Bad Credits'... or the Lions.
The tetric aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it's time to ask for a credit.
And above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
It is true that it has useful information, but little detail.
It's more a page for teenagers than a site for all the public.
What if the game is complete?
Because there's a bedroom in the hotel.
Something's something, because buying a better house or talking...
Morgan Stanley sells participation to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into his capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disbursement nine billion dollars to acquire 21 per cent of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong downturn in its stock exchange.
One week after finding a provisional agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9 per cent of Morgan Stanley's regular shares at the unit price of $25.25, or an amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the book value than 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a return of 10 per cent and a conversion price of $31.255.
Morgan Stanley specified that the global operation would be based on a price per unit of $29, or 28 per cent above its current change.
The Morgan Stanley action, however, lost 6.79 per cent to $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," explained Juan Mack, director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he makes it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His partnership with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more cautious behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified during the last days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its Japanese shares for almost $8.5 billion.
" A week ago, he explained in Tokyo toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, " we thought that participation would have been made up only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation in the economy and the market, we have wished to minimize the risks and cover ourselves. "
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7 % below its accounting value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of about 20 % of the benefit by action.
The agreement provides that MUFG may within one year convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if they are sold by more than 50 % above the conversion price, or at least $47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow you to take investment opportunities, strengthen your balance sheet and increase your liquidity.
A group spokesman, however, refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan had to have greatly relieved his balance since the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, who saw their quote in a bag down half while the cost of security against a risk of defects on their debt was dismissed.
This cost was delayed last Monday but remained at a high level, about 12 %.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "survivor" of Wall Street's big investment banks after the break-ins of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, announced that he had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refund the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, for example, of his colleagues and friends, was the third to put to the vote a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission completed as 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results referring to 80% of the suffrage.
According to these results, "no" received 28%, 7% of the suffrage were null and 0.7% were blank.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it was necessary to obtain half of the more than one suffrage.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the election centre and an account by a non-governmental organization had announced a wide "yes" victory, estimated to be between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The " Constitution triumphed in an overwhelming way " , he had assured, commending the Ecuadorians who headed the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
So, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chavez and Morales, but also by his Chilean colleague, Mikaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in full calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that strengthened the " new socialism " advocated by the president.
The draft Constitution entails an increase in the power of the State on the economy, reserveing it the " development planning " of a country that lives mainly through the extraction of oil by foreign companies and through currencies sending their migrants.
Taken by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants enhanced powers to the head of State, which can carry out up to two consecutive four-year mandates each and will have the possibility of disbanding the Assembly.
Correa already announced that she would use this power and would seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50 per cent of the population live under the poverty line.
It provides for the ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
The 19 kidnapped persons have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived in Egyptian capital after being released Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by the Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all had a good look at their arrival at 3:30 p.m. on board a special aircraft at the military base of Al Maza, adjacent to the Cairo International Airport.
Some helicopters immediately took them to the Maadi Hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be subjected to medical tests, so they could not speak to the press.
"There is good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garana at the airport.
On 19 September, these hostages fell into power of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a safari in all lands in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and from then on they passed from one bay to another.
The group was composed of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptian: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency, in charge of the Safari organization.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, transported on board two helicopters, had launched the attack during the night before dawn.
" A fire exchange occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others have fled," said the responsible who retained the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the "relamp" unit were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commands.
The Italian Foreign Minister, Franco Frattini, mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men of secret services, of special forces," he said without entering into details.
He also dismissed the payment of a ransom.
On the evening of the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an all-terrestrial on board of which the kidnappers were found, of whom he killed six, including the Chadian chief and detained two.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-United Nations Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a statement immediately rejected by this group.
Letters - Most of the culture is silent
A debate on the financing of culture is taking place and is taking up the current electoral campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will be raised to denounce the miserable amounts granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or national famine - stricken historical sites?
Which politician would dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don't we have real laws that actually preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government spend three and a half million euros on restoring only the Chinon castle in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of the heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all of this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Societies of History of Quebec, at least 40,000 benign people regrouped into 211 Societies of History, Heritage, Archives and Genealogy are concerned about finding in history, preserving with little money a few volumes of private files and preserving archaeological vestiges.
These are those who are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and leaders throw their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemetery.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The Governments of the Netherlands nationalize part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands, being the first in Europe, will help with a nationalisation of the Belgian- Dutch Fortis bank, which is in a state of urgency because of the hypothetical crisis in the US market: the three countries will support this financial and insurance institution, which also has businesses in Hungary, with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held higher-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the head of the European Commission's economic competition.
The Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the euro area crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that occurred in several floods over a year ago, so decisions taken with respect to the Bank may, in a sense, be considered as precedents.
According to the decision taken on Sunday morning, the three States will purchase approximately half (49 per cent) of the property owned by the Bank in its area.
The Bank will certainly sell part of its business, including all of the activities - mainly insurance - purchased last year by ABN Amró Dutch.
The actions of the Fortis began a strong descent last week and for the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85 thousand employees, this Bank is too large to allow it to fail.
The company's shares only decreased by 12 per cent on Friday, which is the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January, the value of the actions has decreased by more than two thirds.
Noting the current stock prices, the total market capital of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank's management charged the sudden fall of Fortis' shares to the insecurity of the US market in connection with the approval of the US package plan of $700 billion.
On Monday the actions showed a slight increase.
On Friday they appointed Filip Dierckx as the new director general of the bank.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has made a specific offer.
The Belgian government had already assured the investors that they were not concerned, they would not lose their money.
Among the Bank's customers so far, no panic occurred, they did not invade bank offices to withdraw their money.
The Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Zorro in the gallinero
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign a insurance contract when they see the data on the purchase of a medicine.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will be uncontrollable.
"There are personal data protection programmes, which are linked to the use of recipe data in all cases to the approval of the person concerned.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the chicken at the sororium" - the Washington Post quotes Richard Dick, the designer of the medical prescription monitoring program.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance price and the amount of compensation of the customer's health status and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
They previously sent the client to medical control and signed the contract with him, knowing the result of the control.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer identification number, he easily gets the list of medicines bought in the last year and mid-year, and the program itself concludes on the customer's disease and health status.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of pills to reduce cholesterol, it indicates that the level of fat in the blood is practically incurricularly high, so it is immediately included in a higher risk category.
There are numerous versions of the program, some even establish a risk number, so the insurance company, in addition to the administration, has only something to do, although there are small difficulties in this.
Among the programme's disadvantages are, for example, that some medicines are multi-use, for example, certain substances are used to treat both headache and heat waves and even antidepressants.
This latter is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the first ones do not.
Special companies were formed to consult and process this data, which, before acquiring the necessary information from the pharmacy, require the patient's approval.
The authorities are already obliged to do so, although they have not received fines for neglecting it so far.
Some companies recently also develop the results of laboratory tests and combine them with drug consumption data to obtain more accurate information on the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to these data and at the same time it is increasingly difficult to control their use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
There is already a bill before Congress that gives the authority the right to control the specialized companies for the provision of personal data.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is insufficient: he has therefore developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another issue that such person cannot deny his approval, because unless insurance companies sign the contract with him.
So the chickens, despite everything, are exposed to the good will of the bear.
Marseille Global Menu
The European Union doubles its trade with India
Since the European Union and India are mutually trade partners, this issue, in addition to the other problems in most global areas, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today to deal mainly with cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic development power that should have more voice and voice in international affairs, Member States have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit launched yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the EU, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana, chief representative of foreign policy, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. increase their trade to more than one hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an excessively ambitious goal.
The twenty-one existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have thus been legally harmonized, so air transport can also fly in the future.
By the end of 2009, India wants to sign the Treaty on Free Trade with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The objective is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth largest trading partner in the Union.
The summit paid attention to global affairs.
Both sides condemned the situation of Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism - all forms of terrorism - and welcomed the convening of a United Nations conference.
The conclusion of the Doha round of trade liberalization was also agreed, although both parties had high responsibility for their failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will adhere to its energy and climate programme, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20 per cent.
India also agrees with this, just as the climate conference next year should reach a global agreement and reduce the production of greenhouse gases by 50 per cent by 2050.
They also wanted to hamper the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to pass through the financial crisis.
Today, the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris trusts that French companies will be charged with a value of EUR 20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian editors
There was a strong presence of Italian editors at the international exhibition of the Frankfurt book.
More than three hundred Italian editors will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international sample of the Frankfurt book is waiting for more than 7 miles of exhibitors from 102 different countries that will occupy 171,790 square meters of the sample with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the Italian pavilion opening ceremony: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
He will continue to meet with the press at the Room Struktur on the 5.0 bill of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and perspectives on the status of publishers in Italy.
According to data, the weight of foreign authors' books decreases progressively over total Italian production, and in particular for adults and adolescents.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the millionaire disappeared a year ago
The remains of Steve Fosset's plane, the millionaire disappeared on 3 September 2007 while flying over the Nevada Desert, have been found.
The ruins have been found on an altitude of 3,000 metres, in the area of the Nevada Sierra of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
On the inside of the plane, there were no human remains.
The Commissioner of Madeira County, John Anderson, has revealed the doubts that remained: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have confirmation that it is the one about which Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance" said at a press conference.
The Commissioner has stated that no human remains have been found either on the plane or in the vicinity.
The millionaire, 63 years old, has been killed in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) has reported that a squad of researchers who have identified the device has been sent some hours after the inspection of the remains: it is itself the Bellanca 8kcab, scattered since 3 September 2007, when Fossett fired from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from Nevada's border, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their home of Mammoth Lakes.
It is two documents named Fossett, the two issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a post in history thanks to a long series of prizes.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the world's tour into an aerostatic globe: two single weeks of flight.
Three years later I had made the world's tour on plane and without scales.
Among his memories, he also flew to 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv out of the schematics with an original and well-established design with defined lines and given angles.
This is, in summary, Glk's last born among the ground trucks "compacts" of the star's house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a new window in this sector.
Owned by the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and non-conventional, the communication accompanying the launch of the suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz exhibition rooms since the next 17 October.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the start of the new car launched an unpublished mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi posters, articulated in three different phases, which dominated the central shopping street of Milanes, avenue Como, until November 15th.
The first phase of this new type of communication began with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed in the avenue As it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the images you will have the impression that the car goes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Enlightenment8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recompensated in a single image.
No doubt Mercedes with this publicity is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automotive communication.
Can this formula capture the interest of future buyers? we'll see.
is clear who are the Italian hooligans
In the Trivenet, the prohibition of access to sporting events is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Utras Italy" which has been the Italian National for years and which, so far, has never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival fanatics either.
The group's extraction is on the right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
A small group (less units, in fact) of the Campaign and Apulia have been added to these in Sofia.
They have three-color flags where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night they have been removed so that they are not identified.
They inspire the English fanatics.
In Bulgaria a group of real Nazi fanatics, those of Levski, have found.
The Figc had made available to Italian fanatics 144 entries for the party: all with names, therefore easily controlable.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among those who had left for Sofia, there was no Daspo (prohibit of access to sporting events) at that time, no one who had been banned from attending a stadium.
Four Italian fanatics, who had a history of crime in stadiums, rejected the ticket and also the trip.
The Ministry of Interior now looks forward to reading the acts coming from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for a minimum of five years to the fanatics who have been arrested or identified in the riots.
A Daspo (prohibit of access to sporting events) international which prevents not only Italian stadiums but also those of all Europe.
Our hooligans, they will no longer stand in a stadium.
Good luck!
But now is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others are added.
"We have to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave like this," they say from the Ministry of the Interior.
For this reason, "well-opened eyes" especially in view of the Wednesday's National Party in Lecce."
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia supporters.
Tomorrow the Observatory will meet, Tuesday the Cams, which can also include a section of the Aise (external information and security agency, i.e. the secret service, which deals with the problems at the stadiums.
"Is Duce-Duce choirs and arms raised during Mameli's enamel? In Bulgaria is not a crime ...."
This is Domenico Mazzilli's thought (expressed in a unhappy way) for a few weeks, the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (has taken the place that was before Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste's public security where there was a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duke but, yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics who have been ashamed.
"I do not do the sociologist – add No.1 to the Observatory – the reactions are attributed to the countries in which the event occurs.
So far this group has behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let's also talk about the savages in Mameli's anthem: they're also not a crime, but if they're allowed they're not of education...".
