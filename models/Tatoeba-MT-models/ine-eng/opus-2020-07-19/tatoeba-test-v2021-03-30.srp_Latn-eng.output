I'm sure it was a coincidence.
It's a living being, so of course it sucks.
Tom can write nice.
Are you a man or a woman?
Tom's gonna get better.
Tom works at marketing.
They're a quaint of the limes of the duplicating instruments.
I don't care if our team wins or not.
How far is it from here?
What are you doing?
Did I call you?
We won't let you die.
What can I say?
I'm a little bit impressed.
You can't sit with me.
She keeps knocking like she doesn't have time.
Did you see Tom leave?
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
It's hard for me to understand French when they speak it fast.
She didn't even blink.
What did all that mean?
You can't make us leave.
I took the first step.
Everyone laughed.
It would mean to me if you could do it to me.
You're sad.
Tom worked hard to finish his job on time.
I gave them some food.
You disappointed me.
That's not a big deal.
How much am I gonna take?
I'm messing with you.
If you talk to a man in the language he understands, it goes to his head, if you talk to him in his language, it goes to his heart.
We're not done yet.
I want to see you behind bars.
Let's go to the bar now.
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Are you sarcastic?
Let's try this.
Can I talk to you alone?
Did you see the sunrise?
She put a ring on her finger.
He's as intelligent as his brother.
Tom's on a business trip.
I still can't remember where I left the keys.
Where did you get that scar?
You wouldn't think about her looks, but the story of a kid who ate two cake is from her childhood.
I can't live like that.
Tom's hungry like a wolf.
It was a tough decision.
Everyone's crying.
October Paul was right.
He likes football a lot.
What are you doing down here?
I'm not ready yet.
Do you skip breakfast in the morning?
The Norwegian diplomat was hostile to the Soviet Union, so the KGB launched a compromise action against that Norwegian, and he had a Russian girl and was asked to leave the country immediately.

Didn't you do enough?
I'll take it from Tom.
Don't draw attention.
Do you think games and learning are intertwined?
I think that's all funny.
Leila has a wide circle of friends.
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What year is your car?
Account, please.
Make sure the cat is out and the door is locked when you leave.
It remains to see if I can get there in time.
I could lose my job.
Forget Tom.
I'm working as a free translator.
Tom was nervously getting his fingers on the table.
You look pretty bad today.
I got a game I need to play.
That's what a doctor needs.
I like instrumental music.
I need you to thank Tom for his letter.
I'm blind.
What can't you tell me?
What were his first words?
Just be quiet, please.
We have one victim.
You should let me in.
The eternal snow doesn't look that long.
They're not mine.
What I saw was discouraging.
We're never going back there.

Tom retreated.
These monks live in a monastery.
I don't trust people who talk.
Even a chief detective like Tom can't handle all the problems without significant help from a colleague and a co-worker.
How can I protect myself?
Maybe Tom can help us figure out how to solve this problem.
We have to get rid of Tom.
Are you involved in this?
I thought it was terrible.
Forget I said that.
I didn't make it.
Tom wants to work in the same hospital where Mary works.
I'd like to be rich like Tom.
Another store will be opened in Boston soon.
I was shocked.
Tom's being kind.
Tom told me this morning that he and Mary were moving to Boston.
Can you save me some cookies?
I have an allergy to milk.
Do you know what this sentence means?
I ate a box of chocolate.
Tom's a real nerd.
Eat soup while it's hot.
I'm not leaving this.
Let me help you avoid some problems.
I've never tried to do this before.
Did I let it go?
Mary can't stand Tom's boss because he's a man of shovinist pigs.
I was everywhere in Europe.
Are you coming soon?
It's a harmless lie.
What would I get for this?
The mini skirts are back in fashion.
Thank you for the correction.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Tom doesn't care what I do.
If you need help, tell me.
I've been looking for you.
I have no high opinion of him as a musician.
Tom's been shot.
Did you tell Tom this?
Everybody's talking.
They're all sick.
My father said no.
A lot of people pray before they eat.
Where did she go?
I think you'll be able to do that.
And who are you?
Keep working.
They have improved security procedures and are now better prepared than before.
It's empty.
Frankly, I'm not even sure I'm right.
Don't argue.
Tom was a very good shine when he was a teenager.
Defend yourself.

The music started again.
I don't think you should tell Tom that.
I'll call.
The girl let the birds out of the cage.
Does any of your friends play guitar?
I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
He got what he wanted.
Tom used to fear snakes.
That may not be easy.
Why is drawing trains so interesting?
I ran every test.
I'm sick of your shingles.
There's only one way out.
Which brother did you see?
I'll see.
He's very busy now.
I'm not sure if Tom wants to talk to me.
Should Scotland become an independent country?
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Don't open the window.
I believe in Kyle Mino since 12 June 1998.
You're very rude.
I went to bed yesterday without brushing my teeth.
The danger of scratching on every corner.
When I went to high school, I got up at 6:00 in the morning.
You're becoming unwary.
Is it necessary to make such a noise?
You never let me do anything.
Tom had a dirty year.
Come run with me.
Drive faster.
You're a big help, Tom.
Get in touch with Tom.
What we had was special.
You need to write a novel.
You can't escape the past.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Tom, hold on.
I hope I find Tom.
Tom didn't want to write about what happened.
I'm sure Tom didn't want to hurt you.
The dog house is new.
I got an e-mail in French yesterday.
Why are you so paranoid?
He's the person who spits the father.
Tom passed his fingers through his hair.
I wrote some songs last week.
What am I doing here?
Do you have a dog?
They'll be OK.
The family had dinner at noon.
I thought you were going on a bus in Boston.
He'll clean my room.
Tom and I are not friends, we're just workmates.
I don't see who it is.
Don't stop.
I always thought it was weird.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
Her hands were cold like ice.
One day it'll be mine.
Tom refused to go to bed.
Turns out it's true.
Anything you remember can help.
You'll be known.
Don't stop.
Tom managed to escape right on time.
I like watching you dance.
I'm really proud of Tom.
We have to work hard.
You're very pretty.
Please be honest with me.
I'm really glad I'm here.
I can't answer your question with any certainty.
God save me!
None of us saw Tom do that.
Let's talk about possibilities.
I was just about to suggest you do that.
She decided to go and study in the United States.
It was really inspiring.
Tom has three grown sons.
Take my card.
You still want this?
So, what do we do?
This is my third marriage.
I'm sure next time it'll be better.
The text is very recast.
We're all trying to win.
Check around.
This box is almost empty.
Of course, Tom loves his children.
Nothing can stop us.
Tom didn't offer to pay.
I could come with you.
I don't know who they are.
I can't believe Tom kissed me.
I'll try to find them.
Hey, give me a chance.
Tom, are you and Joe brothers?
Have fun while you can.
Is that love?
Today, the ship was above the Mediterranean Greben - mountain wedding at the bottom of the ocean, at depths of up to 4,500 meters.
Yes, I love it!
It was a little awkward.
Do you have a sample?
When exactly did you do that?
I watched Tom die.
Do you have a blog?
Parliament is dissolved.
I hope that's not true.
Are you finished yet?
Tom would never agree with that.
You look like a very intelligent person.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
She stood up and came to the window.
It was something that led to the explosion of new ideas.
We'll visit you from time to time.
I'm in your hands.
I met some of Tom's friends yesterday.
Think again.
It's hard.
Tom was very nervous.
I've never regretted it.
She was supple.
It's getting dark.
We'd better tell the others.
Tell me about your teacher.
I always think about it.
Tom bought a few black shoes.
I wasn't worried about that.
What was I supposed to do?
I'll have dinner at 7:00.
Pua sang in the church.
Everybody was sitting at the table.
The students didn't know how to answer.
Tom asked Maria if she'd rather go to the movies or just take a break home.
Tom seems a little nasty.
It's started.
I'm proud of this team.
I'm still here.

Don't laugh.
Did you tell Tom this?
You'll destroy your vision if you keep playing games.
I'm an Earthman.
I can read all kinds of languages, but I don't speak any.
Who wants to talk to me?
Bad things will happen.
Say hello to your friends.
What, you still don't know how to drive?
I forgot.
I'll need time to get used to it.
I'll be there.
We're not gonna get wet.
You're kind of right.
Although I told Tom not to open the door, he opened them.
Go straight.
Just like a doll.
I've got a lot of things going well.
Tom's playing with his son.
I'll leave school.
We'll visit you sometime.
The gap between my house and your house is two kilometers.
Just waste your time.
That's a lot about you.
I think it was intentional.
Don't do too much!
I'm proud of this team.
He's speeding up.
Try this.
There's no consequence.
Say hello to your friends.
Tom's gonna go.
Is any of this real?
What are you gonna do today?
He's a man of tradition.
Do you have any paper I can write for?
Is it true that Tom won the race?
Can I hear another one?
I'd really like to see you again.
Let's sit down for five minutes.
What a question!
You're very brave, aren't you?
Tom seemed angry.
I've never noticed that before.
It's probably better not to eat after seven nights.
I'm sure Tom's proud.
Are they in love?
Help me.
Which way are you going?
I like sleeping on soft bed.
Stay positive.
It's all right with my ear.
I just want to get home.
You were right to shave.
How much money do we need?
I played golf with Tom a lot of times.
Tom lives in the center of town.
Don't be a jerk.
Now things are a lot different.
I'm so interested.

I really like your music.
There's no business here.
Can you please tell me how to get to the airport?
I'm excited about this.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis game.
You're contagious.
We need your help.
Is Tom aware?
Tofu goes well with Sake.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I'm not swimming.
She's beautiful like her mother.
You have a point.
I've lived a long time.
Give us some space.
It's not standing.
That's enough, Tom.
Tom was going to ask his boss for a raise, but he changed his mind.
Get in there.
You win!
That's what they both like.
Tommy said I shouldn't talk to Mary.
I keep saying that.
Most scientists rejected the theory of the movement of continents, because it was so difficult to imagine that the motions of the panels were even possible.
How did I miss it?
What did you tell Tom?
It was a bad situation.
Give them as much food as they need every day.
Tom's gonna change.
I responded instinctively.
That's what you have to do somewhere else.
Don't push.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
How often do you upload videos to Jutjub?
Do you know who Tom killed?
Everyone knows.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
It's not that easy.
I'm deep-rooted.
I'm not upset anymore.
Have you completely recovered?
Tell Tom to come here.
It's raining.
Tom's sick today.
That's what they both like.

I'm sorry I'm leaving.
It's almost caught.
They're the ones who want to go.
The teacher explained to us what the poet wanted to say.
What does the doctor think is wrong with your shoulder?
Come on in.
We're in a tough situation.
It's just a personal opinion.
I just don't know what to say.
I'm just very grateful to you.
You got it all wrong.
So, what do you think?
Let's wait a minute.
Tom's in bad love.
Start counting.
You must never come back.
He's a man of blood and flesh with all his flaws.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Come tomorrow.
He's done in prison.
How much money do we need?
Don't drink water.
I'll always remember your advice.
She wanted me to come.
Tom's saving money so he can go to Boston.
Say hello to your friends.
What do you mean by this sentence?
Tom's not writing to me anymore.
Can I take a look at your card?
I'm sorry, I didn't follow up.
Tom knows the procedure.
If a man advances in front of a woman, it's called a favor, and if she's advanced in front of a man, it's called equality.
Are you dyslexic?
Come back in an hour.
Tom used that word a lot.
Tom was staring at his feet.
Are you still jealous?
How is this your fault?
I'm sure Tom would rather stay.
Tom just got sick.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
I'm here for you.
That's what we are.
He's a biologist.
That was a little weird.
Shut that dirty mouth.
Show me the documents.
I still mourn the death of my oldest son.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get back.
Are you coming back now?
She must be over 60 years old.
Did you eat anything?
I've been there before.
I've never learned to write.
They wanted to punish me.
I agree with what you wrote.
Tell me what this is.
I'm available.
We need to talk about this alone.
I'm on Tom's side.
Almost ans catch a few times.
I love this song.
Tom was John's wedding friend.
Plato is a friend, but the truth is a greater friend.
You're lying!
Even a child knows that.
Who are you describing?
We were the only guests.
Tom's a painter.
Do you understand what I mean?
Have you decided what you're gonna do?
Are you sure this thing is safe?
My family loved the dog very much.
You're right.
They can never accomplish it differently than by force.
I thought I'd have another chance for that.
He'll understand.
I'm not here for that.
I assumed you were busy.
She finally fell asleep.
Tom laughs at Mary.
It's almost half three.
I don't know if that's gonna be enough money for me.
Can you pull the curtains?
Have you ever tried?
That seems inhumane to me.
Did you have lunch?
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What's that, little cat, would you like some cream?
We didn't have this in mind for you.
We never played football before.
How did you like Boston?
Tom seemed nervous.
Tom would still be alive if he tied the belt.
It seemed yellow to me.
I'm celebrating.
I'm firmly against compromise.
Everything has its price.
Tom picked up Mary.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
Tom comes here three or four times a month.
We've never been here.
I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.
Jawbreaker circled a multi-layered cotton like a birch.
What's your problem?
How would you feel if your wife left you?
Everyone laughed.
I'm lying.
Tom's on a date.
Don't argue.
Just take care of Tom.
I'll figure it out.
I'm in a better shape than you.
Maybe they're somewhere around the lake.
I wish I knew.
We have a good chance of winning.
Tom's not in shape.
I don't have enough time to explain that to you in detail.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
I'm hurt.
Let's talk about your idea.
It's normal.
That's exactly what I meant.
I'll call her tonight.
She was a crazy year.
It's a lie, Tom.
It's impossible to say with certainty.
Tom never left his home before.
I'm not burning Turkish.
It's only been a day.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
What's your story?
Let's go.
It will last forever.
Why would I want to kill you all?
This knife isn't sharp.
I'm surprised you didn't know that Tom knew French.
These are my best friends.
I'm swimming in the ocean.
Did you see Tom's room?
Let's make some pictures.
I found something, too.
Don't stop.
We never played football before.
She tried.
I have a serious question.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
I looked around.
One senator called the president of another country, an old intelligence officer who would like to restore that country's old empire.
Would you like some more tea?
The ex-manipulation went through the tire.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Don't stand.
There are many galaxies in the universe.
You're very pale.
She hesitated for a moment.
Could it be done?
Can I ask you something?
I want us to be more than friends.
Can you explain?
I bought some groceries.
All things come to an end.
You just saved me a lot of time.
He was Laylin's own dance partner.
A little bird told me.
Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he needed my help.
No doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use some help.
Tom's still frustrated.
Tom made it clear that he wouldn't do it.
Infra-red and ultra-violent rays are kind of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit still for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
"Teach from your mistakes" and "Experience is the best teacher," they say, but on the long track even the best teacher is angry, if he or she has too much to teach in less time.
Deal the cards, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
There's really no need to do that.
I hope there'll be a dry time.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunch tomorrow?
I know him well.
Are they in love?
No one knows what's going on behind those doors.
How can I resist?
I bought a lot of stuff.
I'm just not very happy.
Let me see you, Tom.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
Our secular education is disappointing.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Mario bought a microscope.
I've never camped.
I'm only listening to you.
He rarely gets angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so much?
Did you wash the dishes?
When he returned from his duties in Afghanistan, Tom was chased by the nightmares.
I made up my mind.
Thank you so much!
It won't have any effect.
Don't bluff.
Are you right?
I need your help.
I'm a responsible person.
Add more water.
What Tom suggests could save us all time.
Beautiful!
He's busy enough now.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigarette.
Tom cooks potatoes to make potatoes salad.
Everybody else.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what it is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Either way, you're not right.
It's hard to give up long-term love of one thing.
Tom likes extreme sports.
Strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with large investments in oil and gas.
I have a white horse.
Let's talk about this during lunch.
Say hello to your friends.
How did I miss that?
Is breakfast included in the price?
Tom hates strangers.
We have to respect personal rights.
What's that thing and your right hand?
Can I call you around 2:30?
Someone in Disneyland with me?
Why is drawing trains so interesting?
I don't usually write songs like this.
It's really so simple.
That was a funny mistake.
What are you eating at all?
Don't talk.
Call him whatever you want.
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do that, but he failed.
Jumi will be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother's a Yugoslavian.
There must be a better way to do this.
That didn't matter to me.
He loves me tomorrow!
It's too loud for me here.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's nobody like you.
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
Tom wrote a long letter to Mary, but he didn't send it to her.
He's got a good memory.
Widows are getting cold.
Tom's not very nice.
I really need Tom here.
I believe you're honest.
Come play with us.
Do you know that Tom ever lied?
Mary is a Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you are.
Tom's here this morning.
He's pretty busy now.
Here's some good news.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom seemed very confused.
There was a list of available candidates.
Tom never said anything about it.
Don't get undressed.
Tom never asked why.
Come here.
Tom will know.
Her passport was stolen.
Did I ask you?
I've seen enough for now.
Turn around!
Four kilograms of gold was needed to get rid of the winning medals.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to know the numbers in his head.
Take care of me, and I'll take care of you.
You have to trust me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with the person you're in?
Do you want to talk to Tom about me?
We have to work right now.
I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of dying.
Everybody says that.
Speak clearly.
We're here to play golf.
I've never actually met that.
Don't yell.
This one's unique.
I'm too old for something like this.
We'll just follow you.
It's very hard to know yourself.
It saves energy, you'll need it later.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
You're just shot.
My income has decreased by ten percent.
It could be hard to visit the unknown area.
They're ready to talk about the problem.
Finally!
Tom appreciates contemporary art.
After a long consideration, at the end of the accident, I made things.
It's good.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen often?
We're reducing.
Can you talk to me?
It's a little bit of a TV.
I've been wearing shirts on short sleeves for years.
Old people often talk to themselves.
Tom hoped he'd become a famous writer.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
Tom showed me the poem he wrote when he was a teenager.
Where's Avis' hat?
Tom could tell us how to do it.
I was just leaving.
She spends three dollars a day on lunch and dinner.
I'll see you in your dreams.
Come in here.
I'll be home tomorrow.
I think you're stupid about that.
I've seen enough for now.
I feel bad because I lied.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom will remember.
Why doesn't he just tell Tom?
If there's no porn with that, porn will be made with that.
Canada is a country-mother hockey on the ice.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
Tom's saving so he can go abroad.
I have no intention of changing.
I want to go to Bali.
You can do that if you try.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
This is no doubt a very unpleasant situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She's jogging every morning before breakfast.
This time it leads to the city.
I'm not happy with that.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a bad fight.
Stop watching TV and start learning.
We don't know our neighbors.
The police found stolen money.
I've never seen that before.
I came here a few minutes before you.
I didn't do it either.
How much does a bottle of beer cost?
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
It's too bad!
I've had a lot of fights.
I've got enough space.
Don't yell.
I can't stop thinking about stolen money.
That train's over.
Come see us.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anyone.
They need each other.
I'm trying to be careful.
Check this out.
Come quickly!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of painful memories.
I'm convinced.
The music is important to me.
Do you have a favorite?
Please, come here.
Just take it easy!
I thought I didn't know what was going on.
My friend got 95 points on a math exam.
Tom didn't let anyone else into the room.
Better a mile than a force.
They're waiting for you.
There is no word "freedom" in Russian.
I thought you were gonna be busy.
Could that be true?
Don't worry, Tom.
I hope Tom's safe.
We talked about it all night.
What are you gonna do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
I had to make some tough decisions.
Ammonia is the base.
Check again.
Are you honest?
That made sense to me.
Tell me what to do.
Nothing's been said to me.
Tom didn't make friends easy like Mary.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Bad weather stopped me from leaving.
Tom bought the paper.
And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Black smoke came out of the chimney.
I know, sir.
You'll never catch me alive!
I was open and honest.
It's time for you to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
What is this?
Tom fell asleep again.
Don't move!
Tom's only talking to Mary.
The first lesson is easy.
You've grown up so fast.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
I'm pretty good at doing more things at the same time.
No one's as fast as you.
I agreed to buy that.
Am I just going to a party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please, be honest with me.
Are you sarcastic?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove it?
You can't go into that room.
It's all here.
Tom and Mary were wrong about it.
I'm not as tall as you are.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I never should have gotten involved in your stupid business.
We've been working together.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's saving to buy a yacht.
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
I had nothing in common with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
The new branch to Haugesund will become the main effective travel link to Oslo and Eastern Norway for the entire Western region.
You failed me.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects that Mary and I had something to do.
Where'd you find this knife?
You look good for your years.
Tom managed to find Mary's house without any difficulty.
It's not easy sport.
I just don't want to do it.
You shouldn't have bought that.
They have the right to vote.
Tell me where you are.
Will we see Tom again?
My mother cooks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
The woman's eating bread.
I listened to music.
Are you involved in this?
I must have eaten something bad.
We'll be going soon.
Is Tom still there?
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Avoid the dependency on the color separator.
I liked that one.
Do you like roller bones?
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
Can you smile at Tom?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
How many people were there?
I'm sure Tom will miss me a lot.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Mary came back from school crying 'cause her friends were stalking her.
I don't think anyone knows.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom turned around the room, couldn't calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I ran into an empty cage.
Take a break, Tom.
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come back sometime?
She's wondering how that's possible.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You chose a nice one.
Look at the size of it!
Mary's a wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I'm having trouble talking about my feelings.
Mary came back from school crying 'cause her friends were stalking her.
I'm not sure when Tom will be here.
You should come home.
Alice laughed.
We can watch Tom in the suit, behind a black big piano with dramatic movements of fingers, creating music that is very pleasant to listen to.
The strong winds broke a lot of branches from the trees last night.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
The way to a man's heart leads through his stomach.
It's time to get up.
The house is built of bricks.
I didn't write this.
I can't feel partly responsible.
People were good to me.
Tom's out of town now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary will leave today.
Have you ever tried?
I could go with you.
Take a little.
Come on in.
There's really no need to do that.
I wonder what Tom plans to do.
To get to the mountain, you need to be able to read notes.
Tom's jammed.
They wanted an apology.
Where was I wrong?
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in the house.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do it.
The zoo is closed on Monday.
That's the point.
Knowing foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It is very natural for a human being to always give priority to the interests of others.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I've got a lot of planned things for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
Why are you still awake?
I was in school yesterday.
Tom does what he's told.
I'm still working.
The humid, insensitive children can sometimes grow up in sociopaths.
I'd like to be with you.
Police work is to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you give me a remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
We're all working too hard.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom's studying very fast.
You're different.
She's an unknown hater of others.
This will make our work much easier.
He loves football.
The Monas have been able to play tennis in the monastery.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep out of the reach and sight of children.
Who's Tom, is he your new boyfriend?
I was wondering if maybe I was dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
No one's going anywhere.
Driving to work from hour to hour.
It's right.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do that.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
He's here.
I'll figure something out.
Play it again, Sam.
Some of us think that such views are pure madness.
Someone could be hurt.
Tom didn't write a letter to Mary until he was here.
We've had enough of you.
We all know Tom's guilty.
We need to understand.
I'll be back.
Look at these.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom pulled out a thicker end.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a mild temper.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's okay.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Come play with us.
And it was only with great anguish.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Did you write the number?
That's not a reason for panic.
I only got 20 points for a math exam.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Investigate this.
My future is in your hands.
He's a liar, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him the other day.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
That's so sad.
How smart!
In short, I disagree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not having fun with anyone, are you?
I played the piano a long time ago, so I still know a little bit.
Is this your glass or your sister?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter represented two generations.
He drew himself that he had to work in the garden for two hours a day.
They give apples and cakes, not gold and green woods.
I'm resting my feet.
I really like to practice.
I'm really proud of it.
We were in the last place.
I contributed.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Isn't that black?
You're absolutely right.
Come, sit next to me.
Let's not talk about this now.
It's time to break up.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
The meeting statement is ready.
She looks good for her years.
What is this?
What are you eating at all?
I don't like being judged.
I have an appointment tonight.
A man hopes for as long as he's alive.
Be careful.
Let's discuss options.
That was a funny movie.
Bitcoin is encrypted.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom's gonna take care of this.
Go check it out.
Some of us hate it.
"This came for you." "Uh... "You remember the one you sent when you asked to take pictures of Epljek's brother?" "Yes." And then she told you to write a review of Mek's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent a review of Mek." "Yes." "What did you tell her that you learned from that?" "I realized that Philip's scratcher was convincing, but not misleading; and that Reything severely charges things that I think should do as a friend."
I've always loved horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I get through that?
I'm only going to church with respect to my mother.
It's better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
You don't have to eat right before you lie to sleep.
Tom's gonna wait.
The students didn't know how to answer.
I'm not a night bird.
Tom bought me a VIP card.
I'm the one who should do it.
Tom's gonna call.
He set off his torch before he entered the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a very good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom quit college.
Why do you hate me so much?
Tom will understand.
Those girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's truth in what Tom is talking about.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your beating.
Get out!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make a place.
The horse must have fallen and the knight fell off the horse.
I'm investigating it right now.
She's reached her goal.
Tom can do what he wants, as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said he needed the money.
Tom was pretty good.
He couldn't understand a lot of what they said to each other.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what they both like.
We sat together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never goes by train.
Two sides will keep the talks this week.
I plan to give my son a computer at the end of the month.
Why did you shave your beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
I've never noticed that before.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw the cat.
I'm in the gypsum.
Mom just went shopping.
I'm always nervous about passport control.
That's what needs help.
Defend yourself.
He got a cab to the hospital.
Can you gnaw?
Don't touch the lion while he's asleep.
Tom's uncomfortable.
Could it be alive?
Did you just meet him?
To be honest, I don't know.
It's your choice.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I saw the house.
Maybe she has other plans?
The patient's out.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
Am I so different?
Whose handwriting is this?
Feels good.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Let's have lunch here.
I'll find the money somehow.
I shot a bear.
I'm sorry I'm leaving.
He's been puking the king's bird.
The fire took the first floor.
Tom was very happy when his team won.
They decided to get married.
What did you two do?
I'm afraid you misunderstood this.
I'm adopted.
We have direct access to information.
I'm punished.
The cat was spread all over the length of the sunlight that was passing through the window.
Are you going to school on foot or on a bike?
Tom's not much happier.
Will I just go to the party?
I'm proud of our team.
Only Tom and Mary were saved.
I'm done.
I wasn't really impressed with that.
I left Tom in 2013.
Mary knows her main weapon, beautiful face and young body, passable values.
I saw a mouse.
Try it.
Two countries negotiated a peace agreement.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Answer me right now.
It seemed like they knew what they were looking for.
You tried.
We're just gonna follow you.
I'd better go with Tom.
Let's try it.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Tom really knows a lot.
That's what needs to be dreaming.
That's what I have to tell Tom.
I don't live in that city.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
Tom's not a kid anymore.
I thought you were gonna be busy.
I'm a vegetarian.
I'm used to doing it.
I got a sharp knife.
Tom asked me if he could use my computer.
That's very nice of you.
I've heard this joke before.
I think I missed something.
Send Tom in.
Tom asked me some questions about what just happened.
I'll let you know.
I responded instinctively.
The answer to this question is simple.
I'll make sure Tom has everything he needs.
He was naked and boss.
She's just outside my league.
What are we actually looking for?
Why are you all in shock?
Schools and roads are tax-paying services.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Don't push.
Looks like we're just two of us.
Things are very different today.
I couldn't stop crying.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
I'm really sick of this.
Tom did it the old way.
Where's Tehran?
Let's look at that again.
That sounds like a betrayal to me.
That's what we need to do.
Why are you all shocked?
It's part of my responsibility.
Under the drawing, he wrote, "Take the strings!"
Drive slowly.
What a man you are!
It measures twice, one cut!
How long did Tom have it?
We can save some time if we do what Tom proposes.
If you want to talk to a lot of people, you need to learn Esperanto. Why this language? Because it is also nice and stimulates our learning. International language is very important because there are so many people from different countries around the world. Besides, Esperanto is not only useful but also easy to learn. If you learn Esperanto, you can travel to many countries. Come and learn!
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
Have you been sleeping?
I'll take you to Tom's.
Could that have been Tom?
I have three beautiful granddaughters.
Don't fight.
She got her fingers on the table.
I'm learning a few languages.
I shouldn't have said that.
I wanted to write to you, but I forgot.
You're good to everyone.
Tom showed up in the sky.
I didn't care.
That's not true, is it?
Tom said he didn't see anything weird.
You never get there in time.
That sounds like a betrayal to me.
I'll make sure I don't bother you while you're studying.
Life is short.
They'll know.
All participants gathered in the main hall.
Don't exaggerate.
Hey, relax.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Tom's gonna make it.
Tom was totally scared.
Whose guitar is this?
This won't hurt at all.
We have to get out of here.
We can't stop Tom from doing that.
I'm not selective.
That's what I used to do.
Tom's still at work.
You think better when you shut up.
Are we all here?
Turn around.
Tom was crying out of pain.
Everything or nothing.
Do they like each other?
I contributed.
I'll sign.
Shame him.
That's right.
We hope you like it.
Will the future be like science fiction?
It just happened again.
How long have you been here?
Tom's rich and free.
My mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
That's not my job.
I'm turning around.
Frankly, I don't know.
I hope it's gonna be okay.
The wind calmed down.
In the bedroom, I have a mirror from the floor to the ceiling.
I wish I had remembered that.
Don't make a fool of yourself.
What can you do?
Get out of there.
The Czech Festival was held in Latvia.
We're what we are.
Where did you get that idea?
She let me go.
You didn't answer the question.
We're inside.
No one's coming to save you.
I don't want to do that.
Tom always bothers me.
Are you ready?
She's proud of her talent.
You can start right now.
You need one of these.
I'm impressed with you.
I can't decide where to park.
Cool!
How is this your fault?
Security has been increased in the city.
Cheers!
Tom will stay.
That boy's talking like he's an adult.
The scarves cost three dollars.
My bike's new.
Tom told me he loved me today.
I doubt Tom knows that.
Can I walk you home?
That's what I've already tried.
Go upstairs.
There's no parking allowed.
I'm running early.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's how you make yourself important.
How long have you stayed?
Tom's a passionate cyclist.
How did you find Tom's hiding place?
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
Let's take a look.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom's family moved a lot.
We liked food, especially fish.
And they lived happily ever after.
Tom's too poor to hire a lawyer.
Don't be silly.
I'm interested.
What's the problem?
He's not a doctor.
Tom's been accidentally framed.
Is the man Arap or Hindi handsome?
Let's meet for a drink.
I forget where I leave my hat.
He's been sneaking out again.
I want to see the ocean, too.
Don't even write!
Who doesn't?
Tom does it sometimes.
God knows.
Tom loved Mary.
What do you say I do that?
Let's discuss your idea.
Tom said he was innocent.
All the girls love Tom.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Cover your mouth while you're coughing, coughing, or screaming.
Tom's got his fingernails.
He was a man who never hesitated to resist.
Probably the periodic onset of anger comes because floating ice from Siberia can wear polar foxes on them.
I heard you didn't eat meat.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I've been having memory problems lately.
I'm Canadian.
I'll try.
Am I ever wrong?
What's the name of that restaurant?
It's an official job.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
Who's that, is he your new boyfriend?
Forget it.
I agreed to buy it.
What's the paper?
The temperature of the sun's surface is about 6000°C.
Sami asked a lot of questions about Islam.
If we leave right away, we'll be in Boston by 2:30.
What did you two do?
Where's Tom going to sleep?
Why would Tom want that?
It's hard to figure out what really happened.
She's been through her hair with her fingers.
Tom works hard to support his family.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Tom says he has four houses in five different countries.
Let's see what Tom's gonna say.
I'm starving.
Don't fight.
Come here.
Just tell me you're okay.
Who's Tom?
I'm not afraid of aging.
I don't completely agree with you.
There are many possible answers to that question.
Let's eat ice cream now, before it melts.
I'm just doing my duty.
I took the first step.
I like to watch you play.
It's hard to apply what we said in practice.
How long has your head been hurt?
Ole, the oldest eel in the world, just died, and he was about 150 years old.
Come to the meeting.
I'm proud of this team.
I fell asleep.
Your mother put a cake on the top shelf.
Did you see anyone there?
My father is so old he can't work.
He got what he wanted.
What if I'm right?
I'd like to know I'm taking pictures like that.
I'll try to find them.
I had trouble solving that problem.
I don't know what's not, still or just before, it was good, but several times when I was trying to log on to the site today, I couldn't do it.
Do I usually work happy?
I went there with my own will.
You think better when you close your eyes.
They really meant it.
Have you ever been here?
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Everyone's here.
We're almost done.
Maybe they need something to eat.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm adaptable.
The fugitive from the prison was quickly caught again.
Everything seemed possible at the time.
I sent a map to Tom by fax.
I have a memory problem these days.
Tom may not make it to the meeting.
Tom died almost the same time.
The judge slammed with a hammer.
They also found that the same wrong assessment was made in some other cases.
Try to stay cool, Tom.
We need to find Tom.
I hope this will never happen again.
Please be honest with me.
Tom stayed a few days.
Tom could be here.
I'll do anything for you.
I didn't understand the question.
It was just a matter of time.
Don't be bluffing.
You should be able to change.
Does Tom have a cable?
Those who want to stay can stay.
If the rental period is extended beyond the agreed period, the proportional rent supplement shall be calculated.
Why should I tell Tom?
Let your imagination be at your disposal.
Tom knows the names of all his customers.
Tom saves over 80% of what's due.
Are we safe now?
We're what we are.
He's not honest at all.
That's wonderful!
That's great!
Tom knows what he likes.
I'm dyslexic.
You've helped me a lot.
Identify yourself.
I'm really happy about that.
It just has to be like that.
I'll come when I can.
Don't get dressed.
It's not all gold.
Are we all here?
We have to focus on our virtues.
How fast!
The faith can move mountains.
I don't give up!
Tom fell off the truck while he was feeding the Irvase.
Tom became a dancer even though his parents were wearing it.
I think we've met before.
I was wrong before.
Can you tell us more?
Tom knows it's over.
It's a betrayal.
I'm not late, am I?
Let's go get Tom.
Tell me where you live.
You don't remember anything?
Tom's drinking a lot.
I'm not from here.
Tom was sitting on the grass under the coconut tree.
Everyone laughed.
I'm more zealous than I look.
I don't want you to see me naked.
Can I go?
Tom doesn't like to do that.
Do you have a copy?
Come help me.
I barely got out of the house when it started raining.
Tom likes to be busy.
First, first.
Tom's just lazy.
I'm a little bit impressed.
Does that mean you love me?
Check this out.
Is there any evidence?
You must be strong!
Are you ready for more?
Tom turned the trigger on.
Tom always smiles at me.
She rarely, maybe never, goes to bed 11 hours ago.
Are they all crazy?
What are you eating at all?
He's so weird.
I'm pulling a line here.
Pay attention to school rules.
Keep digging.
Which school did you go to?
Can I hear another one?
They all ran away.
I've already written to Tom.
Tom had to write the composition again.
You want to get involved?
I knew I shouldn't be involved in your little business.
Tom asked me for permission to use my computer.
Was I really so happy?
Tell me what this says.
I'm not upset anymore.
Did Tom change his mind?
Get out of here.
Do you think what she said is a lie?
His younger brother is a famous footballer.
Saosam was too busy.
I already ordered him.
How does it work?
Will we see Tom again?
You're different.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
That's my job, not Tom's.
Tell me what it is.
Tell him I'm innocent.
I'd like to help.
It'd be hard.
She's making him meals.
Where did you learn English?
Beauty lies in the eyes of observers.
How are you feeling today?
That's why I need a reason.
Okay, what's the secret?
Shall we start soon?
Did you see me dancing?
I'm starving.
Naoko lives in a white house.
Tom plays the piano very well.
Tom managed to escape right away in time.
I don't know anything about her.
You're just hit.
I'm here for you.
I'm not rich enough.
Seniors should pay for their hats and clothes.
Is he looking at me?
Don't move!
It's all Tom's fault.
I've been training for months.
What was the plan anyway?
You're supposed to be here at the end of half a.m.
Tom said no one was hurt.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I thought I didn't know Tom.
I saw a nil horse in the zoo.
I'm thinking about Tom sometimes.
Are you both drunk?
Please be honest with me.
Don't go out tonight.
It's not easy to entertain Tom.
He's a man of words.
I'll see if Tom can help us.
It broke into two pieces.
Muriel is now 20.
Did you eat anything?
Have you gone to see Tom?
Tom's gonna make it.
Why are you acting like a child?
That's exactly what the doctor ordered.
Could you read it?
The window's from the glass.
Are you done yet?
Does Tom have a key?
Don't talk.
Don't stop.
Are you sure this is safe?
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know.
You'll be better in a few days.
That's what Tom would want us to do.
Tom said to ask you.
Just tell me the truth.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not upset at all.
Tom's a bookie.
I've changed my mind.
Problem is, it's too expensive.
Many would like to be motivated, creative, thoughtful beings, only if they get that chance.
You sound tired.
Tom was wrong about that.
Tom always makes a mess of things.
It's not the right thing to do.
Please write down everything I say.
I wish you could sleep.
Maybe you can't hear me.
We're grilling.
I thought you were married.
I'll somehow find the money.
I assumed you were busy.
I hear Tom's interested.
We need to move forward.
What are your ambitions?
I don't like eating a white bow in the morning.
I think Tom's very smart.
Do you really want to learn another language?
I think I'm fat.
I think we were lucky.
Don't talk.
Come have a drink with me.
Stop yelling.
It's Saturday.
They were evacuated to the U.S. Polish hospital.
We'll run to the park.
You can't sit next to me.
I'm not happy about that.
Could you read it?
We need to call Tom.
Tom's not strong enough.
Tell me what he says here.
I'm staying.
I know Tom let you down.
Tom was badly hurt.
If you need help, tell me.
I took the first step.
I'm still a little tired.
I'm sure there's a better way to do that.
The first one leaves at 17:30 and arrives at 20:25.
That was a little weird.
Does it read and write Japanese?
Tom put the card on the table.
Everything was just an accident.
Tom never even saw us.
I don't intend to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
This usually works.
How did you find Tom's hiding place?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
And now it's our sponsor's word.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him as a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad we're here.
I'm armed.
Tom can't stand it.
It's bedtime.
Tom wanted to have a better cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you bring a fine?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know why.
How do you feel?
Bitcoin and ether are virtual currencies.
It's all very cheap.
Anything you remember can help.
A lot of predictions don't come true.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm still wrong.
Turns out it's true.
I'm sorry.
Tom likes a good party.
I don't care what he says.

Tom may have to stay here for a few days.
My father doesn't like football.
This hat is from Australia.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Go take a look.
I thought the food was great.
I'm not alone when I'm eating.
You look fat.
You need to learn English step by step.
That's better now than it was before.
Tom and Mary differ as heaven and earth.
Tom asked me for an opinion on who would win the race.
A man has many desires which he does not really want to fulfill, and it would be wrong to assume otherwise. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be bitter disappointment to him. One of such desires is the desire for eternal life. If it was fulfilled, man would become completely sick from everlasting life, and he would yearn for death.
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car alone.
She's taking care of her old mother.
Tom had the same problem.
Don't laugh.
Tom and I just wrote a few books together
There's news.
No one really wants us.
They all paid.
Be careful.
I'm alone.
Don't drink water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
The price of gold changes daily.
Tom got married.
I could go with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
You don't have the right to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is it interesting to take pictures of trains?
I hope you like it.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a pimp.
What are you planning on doing this flight?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Betoven wrote nine symphonies.
I'll hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
Do you like costumes?
I saw Markus's house.
It's really bad enough.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't follow us.
The house where Ataturk was born in Thessaloniki.
People are wrong.
He's got two cars.
That was three months ago.
Let's hear your excuse.
They've formed a swim team.
Tom took the package to the orphanage.
Keep digging.
Tom jumped up and down.
Tom's dog was lying.
Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
No, no, no.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
Don't exaggerate.
I can't approve this project, there's a lot of shortcomings.
Are you texting Mary?
I'll keep your place in first order.
Mary pushes her kids to play football.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to give me the pen.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
What did you conclude?
I prayed for you.
The bathroom's upstairs.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
It's only a few minutes from here.
What do you know about me?
I got off the bus.
You're an average student.
In childhood, many violent criminals tortured animals indiscriminately.
How long are you gonna get angry and yell at us?
How important is that?
Do we want an aperitif?
If you want, I'll teach you how to play kulls.
I'm already used to it.
It's not that terrible.
I like to play the music my friends wrote.
Tom confessed.
It's hard to work with you.
Tom got sick.
I'm guilty.
Don't answer it.
Get some wine.
Things aren't always what they seem.
Show me the photos!
It's necessary to break down a few old houses.
What did you do?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom sneaked into the party.
Tom's very sensitive.
When are you going?
This report is not written very well.
She insists that this last move of the government has a multiple meaning.
Tom's here this morning.
It's been about a year.
How did I miss that?
It could be a trick.
Don't forget to get used to sunscreen cream.
Tom didn't try to deny Merina's verdict.
Tell me what this is.
His hair almost covered his face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh largest country in the world.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean the snow off the roof?
I'll take it from you.
One student from Oslo who falsified his degree to enroll in college was sentenced to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish it had come to my mind.
Tom made vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You were really good to me.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I look usually happy?
It's not my own problem, it's all these deadly questions and explanations of words that drive me crazy!
He's here this weekend.
Looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
It was a hit on luck.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like that before.
I'm buying a lot of stuff in that store.
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
Clean it up a little.
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people like chicken.
I didn't do that either.
Let's take a look again.
The last time I went to the beach, I was burned down.
Pull back.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Watch out here, Tom.
We've repaired some damage caused by spraying stones on your car.
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
Do you doubt me?
Luckily, Tom didn't get seriously hurt.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've eaten enough.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try your way.
How can I resist?
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car alone.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
We're not getting into it.
Hold on, Tom.
Tom definitely pulled out a thicker end.
He's not even.
It's all right with me.
It's obvious Tom's sick.
I started to study English when I was twelve, and then I was interested in languages, but not to that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; so it's time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the tunes of that song.
I need an honest girl.
She's a beginner.
Are they still there?
I'm sure Tom will miss me a lot.
Tom won't escape.
I'd go.
Down!
Tom couldn't bear it.
Anything you remember can help.
That's not something to worry about.
I realize they're a thorn in the eye like you, but this is just a mess.
Tom's gonna make it.
No free lunch.
Please leave this place clean as much as you would like to find it.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
We can only do so much.
Guys, can I talk to you for a minute?
It's your life.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I feel it.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
You learn how to do it.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
They won't take it.
There's no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
I'm doing my job.
It's all quiet again.
I didn't make it.
Tom's going to school for graphic design.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unhappy.
You should face reality.
We managed to escape right on time.
I'm sick of everything.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
I want to talk to Tom about it.
It's supposed to work.
She hated him.
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens that way.
Take a little.
He's talking about others so they'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused he didn't even know any question to ask.
Find Tom.
I think it's okay.
What do you think?
You changed my life.
The reaction is not always the best way to act.
I won't tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to take him to the airport.
The Committee recommends that those who complained should be reimbursed for the proportional share of annual interest payments.
Tom bought the time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of superlative.
It's possible in theory, but in practice it's very difficult.
It's almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
Tom's disarmed.
Remember the filename before you try to revert the deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom was running down the street.
The answer to this question is free.
Let's get to work.
I didn't get upset about that.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
We won't let you die.
There's a lot of stuff going on in my hand.
Tom wants his children to learn the importance of work.
Tom was always a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Tom's one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much am I gonna get?
How many close friends do you have?
It's happening.
How long do you think Tom's been preparing for the exam?
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You don't have to throw stones in a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.
Not cepidals.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do it.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everybody.
I probably won't watch TV tonight.
Did Tom pull out a thicker end?
Give me all the money.
Mere provided great support.
The girl sees the boy.
It's very difficult, almost impossible, to find an apartment in Oslo.
My French is still not very good.
It happened right here.
I don't know Latin.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I'm waiting for my turn.
I've been hit by a lot of news.
You're not the one who died.
Would you rather have some tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom asked for help.
They know you.
I put every test.
There's no point just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right now.
It's an area with a lot of new houses.
I can't believe all this.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
Yesterday snow fell.
We walked through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid a spare key in his garden.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I went out to the wrong bus station.
I only wrote this song for you.
Have you read the Bible?
And if I were rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Are we safe now?
Are you going to send this as a mail?
What are you suggesting?
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Watch out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
Come on, give me that.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was nice.
For some strange people, the knowledge of a language is kept secret.
I'm not going to change.
They moved forward slowly.
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
Don't be silly.
It's your blue.
Come visit us soon.
Were you in an accident?
Tom's worried about what might happen.
He was an honorable man.
My father doesn't like football.
We're all out of alcohol.
Card, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Something was lying on the ground.
My friend lives a god behind his feet.
Do you think Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
What are you gonna do today?
Tom looks like a banker.
That's Tom.
Tom still seems worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary is a very shy girl.
Tom doesn't have a problem like that.
You can't hide secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You've been waiting for a hard day.
It's good.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I'm not going to participate.
Is that exactly what Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be completely satisfied.
I'm so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always behave rationally.
I didn't even do that.
Did you post the exams?
I sincerely support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Did we agree?
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Tom went there.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't do it.
Tom used to be scared of me.
Tom whispered something to Mary and she laughed.
Can I take a look at your card?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
It's clear.
It's your daughter's birthday.
Will anyone tell me what to do?
It's obviously a bit of a knockout error.
Your book is twice as big as mine.
We're not both rich as much as we want.
Tom wouldn't be happy.
Tom has a nice garden.
The cup of coffee broke my head.
Do I have a knife?
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom's got a bony hair.
I've seen enough for now.
I hate that one.
We'll miss you a lot if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's going to happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom will look.
Here's what I think.
I could go with you.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you turn the bomb off?
I need five more minutes.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples Tom gave her to make apple butter.
How many songs did you write?
We're glad we got you here.
You can write in any language.
How do we manage others when we cannot control ourselves?
Don't hurry.
You can learn, regardless of your age.
He dedicated his life to making a vision of what he wanted to create for himself and for others.
Did you give it to Tom?
Who have you been helping recently?
Just close your eyes.
Tom's a little worried.
How is this your fault?
How did I get this over with?
What am I supposed to write here?
My father bought me a book.
I'm adaptable.
Citizenship is a prerequisite for voting.
How many times have you been here?
He's fixing electronic devices.
Lose.
I'm ready, bro.
Please shut up as hard as you can.
This fish is big.
Follow my sugar, please.
It's nice to be needed by someone.
I hope we figure this out.
We all have to face this.
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our supervisor came up with a good idea and we made a great plan.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired I can't keep my eyes open.
Give me my sugar, please.
Come quickly!
Where did you find the keys?
Have you ever hung a video on Jutjub?
I was very interested in participating in the building of an intensive academic plan for programming.
Just give me the money.
She's pregnant.
Don't let Tom find out.
I can't wait for Monday.
Have you been here before?
Does Tom have any experience?
I don't understand.
Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
I could kill you now.
Mary used the walking sticks that helped her to climb and fall on her journey.
The compass shows up north.
Don't talk.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
What initiative has this been done on?
Finish this.
Which one do you want me to take?
I like cable food.
Where's your friend?
When are we gonna start eating?
The Queen and the King have reunited their powers.
I don't know why my head hurts.
I guess you already know the answer to that.
The flowers were completely introduced.
"How old are you?" "Sixteen."
I like this book at least.
The blue looks good on you.
Tom wasn't as handsome as Marie said he would be.
Give me that other box.
Tom has an older brother, John.
I'd accept.
They'll know what to do.
Why did you keep quiet all the time?
He's gone.
It was fun to celebrate together.
I'm afraid I dislodged the right shoulder.
You really need to shower.
What's the purpose of life?
He's driving a pole.
She took my right hand.
I don't know much about you.
Did you do something?
You should probably talk a little slower.
I need a beer.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Does that happen often?
She told me one bird.
I couldn't see who it was.
Crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You need to talk to me.
It just wasn't our day.
Take it all.
I quit.
It's all wrong.
Everything's ruined.
Marriage between people of the same sex is now legal in 20 countries, including Ireland since yesterday.
Take this home with you.
She bought her bread.
We'll try your way.
Serve yourself.
You deserve me to congratulate you.
Since the message was in French, I read it easy.
Finish this.
Tom tried to answer Mary from it.
Can you get me some water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
They're all gone.
I'll learn more.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
None of us saw Tom do it.
And you're wondering why we can't stand your company?
You wrote my name wrong.
You're different.
Shame her.
I got two cats.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
I didn't care.
Some of them were and are still in constant danger from political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I still don't think the Internet is a place for children.
That was hard work for me.
What did you conclude?
You're real to me.
He needs it.
It's obviously a tipfeller.
Are we done?
I'm surprised you didn't know that Tom was in Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a little boy.
Check it out.
Tell her.
I'd accept.
You're my luck.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Bad things will happen.
Several trees fell during the storm in our area.
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before.
Everyone laughed.
I didn't know you were so rich.
He refused to comment.
We're trying.
I'm giving up.
Tom seemed angry.
Don't overdo it.
Oh, yeah, I'll be busy tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
I'm sure they need you.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think writing's going very well.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
That helps us a lot.
I filled the glass.
I'm not selective.
How many uncles and uncles do you have?
That morning, Maria went all over the village.
The voice went out fast.
Am I so different?
Tom pulled out the keys and opened the door.
I just got here.
What Tom did helped a lot.
I've never seen that before.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not worried at all.
It's helping.
Smoke slept with 25 men in one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I hope I'm not the only one who's gonna be there.
Are you mad about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This is why I'm so uncomfortable.
The costs will soon increase.
Was I really so happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar to me.
I'll go to the sea tomorrow if it's nice.
Tom's gonna call.
I had dinner with her.
You see everything in black.
My car wasn't good enough.
Do they doubt me?
What do you have to do?
Tom likes to drive.
They couldn't travel because there was a problem.
Winter's over, spring's over.
It's really so simple.
Since those papers were written about the fact that no farmer wants to work as a shopkeeper in Westfold, the interest grew rapidly.
I'm punished.
I have to get inside.
We're a little busy here.
Get on board.
It's really surprising.
Have you ever seen the UFO?
You're on my way.
It's getting dark.
What's a big secret?
The police are chasing me.
I took the first step.
I hope Tom remembers this.
We ask teachers questions every day.
What kind of food do you usually cook?
If the world wasn't in the state it's in right now, I could trust anyone.
Three wounded, who are currently unclear about their condition, were evacuated to the U.S. Polish hospital.
I prayed for you.
The ether and the bitokin are encrypted.
Hello, can you hear me?
We live on the sixth floor.
I'm not afraid of you at all.
Whenever I see you, my heart tells me I'm in love.
Are you all right, folks?
Will you help me?
It didn't get so bad.
Tom took the chairs to the next room.
I'm ruined.
I respect people like that.
Did you see it work?
Is that yes or no?
Don't laugh.
I'm not a bad student.
We're done for today.
He's a complete monarch.
Since the consequences are potentially serious, the general precautions to avoid infection in this type of patient are valid.
I'm a free man.
I don't like people who're upset.
The room was dark.
He's going home.
It could be weapons.
I can't fix the car by myself.
I'd better go with Tom.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Shouldn't you be preparing for school?
I want to feel important.
A second later, his lips burst into a bad smile.
My mother was an alcoholic.
Mer's enthusiasm for the course fell when her favorite lecturer moved away.
I don't want to be rude.
I guess you already know the answer to that.
Tom was nervous when he started a new job.
Help me.
The United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945.
Are you reading something interesting?
Smoking is not allowed here, it's your cancer somewhere else!
I assumed you were busy.
Tom's always very nice.
I barely closed my eyes.
Was Tom here when we got here?
Was I really so happy?
I took off my wig.
Tom won't be happy when he hears that.
Tom was named after his father.
Did he really commit suicide?
I'm going to sleep.
What was I supposed to do?
Don't come near my wife.
They'll know what to do.
Do you have a copy?
I wasn't really a friend.
Did I let it go?
I just want to get out of here.
Why do you mean that?
Little kids like to touch everything.
She's got her hair wrapped with papillotines.
He's released from military service.
My right blood.
I'm motivated.
Knowledge sets us free and makes us better people.
I didn't mean to drag you in.
Are we safe now?
Which one of your friends will come?
Can you explain them to me?
I've seen Tom play a lot of times.
You tried.
I'm taking you to dance.
Tom might try to convince Mary to do that.
She's made of an elephant mosquito.
You told me not to lie.
He was formerly a member of the social elite, rather than a representative of the broad masses.
I'm terrified.
Help us reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't be hasty.
Give me the pen.
Just tell Tom I called.
There's no answer to the question what's best, because it's always individual and dependent on the situation.
Tom thought Mary was cute.
Be careful.
You look like a very smart person.
I have the same desire to go abroad for a year to complete.
The house burned to the ground before the firemen arrived.
The moons with the most rains are May, June, July and August.
Do I usually look happy?
I've already written a part of the report.
I was ready for that.
Show me the document.
It has to do with what...
That can hardly be about passion, maybe it's just sex.
Have you finished cleaning the dishes?
Only I can do it here.
Tom's gonna pay.
The hunting season is over.
I love the cable kitchen.
I'll start with a beer.
Thank God.
That gives me an idea.
Is Tom nearby?
I'm motivated.
What a tragedy!
We're here.
Knowledge makes us free and better people.
Don't talk.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
I've almost never been home during the day.
The best parents of all are those who allow their children to follow their native talents.
I'd go.
You're very rude.
You let me down.
There's a whole year of snow on this mountain.
I don't think you're supposed to hang out with anything these days.
What's in nature forever, when it's so passable?
The engine's overheating.
I'll see you later!
Without you, I feel lost.
I have to plan everything.
This may not be enough.
That's a good thing you've come up with.
Everything you have one day will have you.
No matter how busy Tom is, he never forgets to send our e-mail to his T-shirt once a week.
The dog's dead.
This is life.
Do we have any of this?
Is this your suitcase?
Tom stopped for a second.
Because of the bad weather, the plane's late.
Investigate them.
I'm in a better shape than you.
I'm not so worried.
Come on, Tom.
I think it's possible to do that.
I'll be asleep in about an hour.
I'm pretty happy now.
He first did a preliminary test with a new electronic alcohol test, before he was sent to laboratory testing.
We were walking in the park.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Look around.
It was a stressful day.
Is it clean?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom was looking nearby.
Let us help you.
I'm surprised you didn't know that Tom didn't know French.
What's your job?
Let's continue the discussion.
How much am I gonna get?
I want to be with you.
This was refined and decorated in a person so strange, cruel and stubborn that a little one judged himself to be closely cooperating with him.
She's pregnant.
Don't move!
I could get there by 2:30.
Merauke is Indonesia's most secure city.
Tom often came here as a student.
We'll take the next one.
Did you do the homework?
Check everybody.
Tell us about the ghosts.
Check everybody.
The session is over.
I've got a lot planned for tomorrow.
We have to follow Tom.
Tom saved $300.
What does she look like?
I'm poor.
I can't wait till Monday.
Come with us.
Tom's on his way here.
Tom wasn't fat.
That's crystal clear.
I'm trapped.
Cut the cheese on thin pieces or on small cubes.
Have you ever had a car accident?
I'd like to start.
I didn't wear any wearable clothes.
I'm fascinated.
Just serious questions, please.
Man, that sentence caused the right move.
Give food to the homeless.
I translated the song the best I could.
He came out a few minutes ago.
I believe you're honest.
Tom wanted a bigger house than his neighbor.
Tom has an eye infection.
I'm glad we were there.
Although I was sick, I did my best.
Big boys don't cry.
I could go there now.
I need to write ten pages for next Monday.
The situation was extremely dangerous; it was a matter of life and death.
I've never noticed that before.
I have to sleep.
Tom usually comes to school before any other student in the department.
I'm touched.
And if I were rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Why?
"Where should I sit?" "Anywhere."
Wisdom is needed to understand wisdom: music does not exist for the deaf audience.

I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
Troubled children are often without any guilt.
I feel bad because I lied.

Maybe they gave up.
That's why I liked Tom.

Tell him.
How do you get rid of the mole in the garden?
It's Saturn.
My aunt gave me flowers.
I hope that's not true.
Don't stop.
I don't like it when you work at home.
Of course, Tom loves his children.

I'm very proud of that.
Ataturk was born in 1881, in Thessaloniki.

I want to answer the last question first.
Did you tell Tom this?

It's only five in the morning, and it's already light out.
I hate math.
What's your aunt doing?
If there is, the crossover with that will happen sometime.
Tom's a good French man.
I can't help Tom do that.
I know this is weird.

She always wears shitty clothes.
Is that about to solve the thing?

Who's Tom?
Tom seemed older and older than the other boys.
It'll last forever.
The top of that mountain is flat.
She laughed.
The gifts of Vishnua are called the Vishnuans; the gifts of Shiva are the Šivans.
Tom would like to know if you'd like to come to this party.
You've grown up.
I've completely lost my mind.
I've never regretted what I did.
I'm convinced.
Do you speak Roman?
Tom came to see me yesterday afternoon.
Hello, my friend!
Tom's still at work.
Have you slept enough last night?
This must be the place.
If you're not a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.
They must have known all the time.
"I think the ending is ugly," he said. "Somewhere in things that people make I want to see scars, failure, disorder, distortion."
Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I turned down Tom.
I'm not 100% sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
I'd buy that one.
This exceeds all the limits.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
Apparently, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
It wasn't too hot.
I almost forgot my passport.
Tom's reading a lot.
I hope you don't talk about me.
You're good to everyone.
I'm usually not this busy on Monday.
My sisters are both teachers.
Looks like he's working.
I don't live to eat, I eat to live.
Tom seemed very confused.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
Just tell Tom I called.

I think Tom's hiding something.
Tom, I need your help.
During an experiment on the power of observation, Tom couldn't describe any picture from the wall of his living room, even though he lived there for two years.
That's good enough.
I was definitely lucky.
Everybody kept their breath.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
I called him.
How much does that sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
I like to watch you while you work.
I hope we'll visit Beijing too.
You're my inspiration.
This time, I stopped commenting on my beloved friend.
I agree.
Be careful.
Did anyone call me?
We'll have lunch together in half an hour.
I'm still a little tired.
To strive to maximize their own interest, happiness or security seems very natural to one human being.
I can do it like a joke.
I don't sing.
It's weird that no one knows the victim.
We're out of here for five minutes.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Translation is not as close as many people think.
Tom would never admit it.
It was just the beginning.
Did you finish your homework?
Is everything all right between us?
I've never camped.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the years on a tree that we dug and found out that it was thirty years old.
See you later, Tom.
Do you want a fruit juice?
Let's schedule a meeting.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
Tom's still in shock.
Boston's a great city.
We hope people like it.
Maybe they'll leave tomorrow.
I want to show you something.
Remodeling.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
I'm scared.
I was happy yesterday.
I really liked Tom, too.
He loves rituals.
No one's been helping us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you lived here?
Get help.
I didn't ask you not to do that.
Tom writes a letter to his shirt every week.
He still has no experience for this job.
Can you help us?

Where did I leave the keys?
I'm a big fan of football.
She came by herself.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your brother.
Tom's lost his feeling.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Tom will look at it.
I wonder if anyone could help me.
I'm surprised.
Everyone laughed.
I played golf with Tom a lot of times.
You underestimate me.

We're close friends.
My friend can speak Hindi correctly.
Yeah, isn't it great?

It was a little weird.
I really enjoyed it.

Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom was writing on the ground with a stick.
Don't you want another glass of milk?
Have a good time!
Chances are against me.
I'll quit.
She expects us to help her.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
That's good.
I don't want to get you drunk.
Tell me what's going to happen.
Tom's seen enough.
Are we moving soon?
They're selling sugar at the store.
Tom and Mary were watching the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does it sometimes.
Thank you for helping Tom.
What did you both do?
Happy birthday!
Photos of nature and animals, photographed in complete silence and calm, are real masterpieces.
My mother died the day I got married.
I'll never mention this again.

The white family will come to Tokyo in the 11th.
What did you do to me?
Enjoy it.
Let me write you a step.
Tom's probably still hiding.
Mary looks cute whatever she wears.
Watch out!
Tom failed to produce any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You have a bad nature.
I'm on my way.
I bought this yesterday.
I had a very bad day.
The whole state is messing with it!
I'm not a good swimmer.
Does he love me?
Tom's got the omelet ready.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm desperate.
I was happy yesterday.
By the way Mary knocked the door, Tom realized she was sad.
Now's not the best time.
He's not a child anymore.
I'm trying to check the futon twice a week.
My education made me do what I did.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Wherever I go, I'm there.
You want to join me?
Leave a book on the top shelf.
We could be happy here.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
Is that what it takes?
Take it all.
You tried.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
I just saw Ambassador Saudi Arabia resign.
Be careful.
Maybe something's wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open that.
I had trouble solving that problem.
I don't want Tom seeing me naked.
You're the most boring person I know.
Get in touch with Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you that kind of information.
I didn't do it.
I'll check.
Tom was shocked.
Wait a minute, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom's still looking upset.
That's what the doctor ordered.
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
If P, then Q is logically equivalent to (No P) and/or Q.

That's an exception.
Tom came a little earlier today than usual.
I could eat a horse.
I've never actually met Tom.
What's easier?
Tom asked for an increase.
I've never noticed that before.
This is supposed to work.
I always liked Tom more.
Where's Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought the papers and read them on the train on his way to work.
I've got the ghosts.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're funny.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
Let me try the other one.
Take it easy.
I didn't do that either.
Snoria Sturlusson's stories tell others that Christianity in Norway has spread by violence.

I fell apart.
I assumed you were busy.

I'm terrified.
It's great.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
John and Mary always walk by holding their hands.
Where was I wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I missed so many opportunities.
It helped me a lot.
Give me another example.
Tom still has some time.
The pain is boring.
Tom was more than generous.
I'm just slowing down.
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
We're lost, aren't we?
We won't let you die.
Did you go see Tom?
This is the beginning of a new era.
I don't have a card.
Nothing happened.
I made an apple pie.
He's got a good reputation.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Everything's different.
The truth has to be said.
Look how it is!
We have to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, working on his bike.

Do you agree?

Are they still there?
Tom didn't write Mary very long.
"Yes, a breath of orange, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.

It's an important purpose.
I've already thought about it.
Stop trying to blame me.
I'll live.

There was nothing to eat.

You're opening the door.
That's good.
Who's Tom?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you don't talk about me.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?

Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.

I'm really happy to be here.
At that point, it exploded with a big crack.
That's exactly what I said it would happen.
Tom knows that over 91 percent of the Norwegian population is supplied with drinking water from surface sources.

It's said that a new restaurant was built.
The price of this book is five dollars.
Can you keep secrets?

You never know what's going to happen tomorrow.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need something to drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I disagree with you completely.
Do you keep this place for someone?
How are you these days?
Sunday is seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.
Are you coming to Tom and Merina's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
I'll be back later.

No, don't do that.

Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he didn't have a choice.
Can you go, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
Tom's been working for about nine hours all the time.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
Here you go.
They couldn't all hear what Tom said.
I'll shower.
We have four hours of French every week.
Let's start now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
It's our only hope.
I got up on my left foot today.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It was a presentation that was published every year.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Tom didn't practice.
Thank you so much!
Keep the coussor.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do the test again.
Why would Tom give up?
Europeans took advantage of other civilizations 500 years ago.
I'll pray for your family.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even children know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
It makes me very angry.
Is there still light outside?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the border.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.

That's very nice of you.
I wish it had come to my mind.
Tom managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw the cat.
I saw the cat.
In Paris snow falls.
I hope Tom gets back safe.
Can you smile at Tom?
I'd better clean up now.
You tried.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't do it.
Tom's strict or fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us ate a pot of potatoes salad.
Come alone.
I didn't tell you to do that.

She did what she was told to do.
I'm a bald man.
You need one of these.
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weak point.
You're one of us.
One leg is in the grave
Tom just told me the other way.
Louder!
I'm compassionate.
Tom's dissatisfaction.
It'd be a pleasure.
He's crazy like a power.
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote.
That doesn't scare me at all.
How old are you?
Tom asked me if I even slept last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Nice to meet you.
This place looks a lot different from what it used to be.
Why are the rabbit's ears big?
I'm a runner.
I want to help.
I know how to do it.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's really an idiot.
Come see us.
He lied to us.
That's a pretty good problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to solve things in a walk.
This one's really cool.
I really enjoyed it.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Ked.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe?
I'm sorry I tried at all.
That river looks flat, doesn't it?
I can keep a secret.

Mary said she'd reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't raise her salary.
"Will you think?" "Yes, I will."

Please wait a minute.
I won't do it!
I'm tired of the fight.
How was your day?
What am I looking for here?
She's a singer.
I like to watch you play.
I was definitely lucky.
What first song have you ever written?
Tom could get out of here.
I just want to get out of here.
Don't let him get away with you like this.
Be careful.
It's in the first year of college.
I've been looking for grape juice.
I was thinking about my family.
Can you smile at Tom?
My liquid language knowledge is enough for many situations, but not for expressing my, often contradictory, emotions.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the police.
I often feel a heartbeat.
Tom's on a secret mission.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I kneeled once.
I'm sorry I'm always bothering you.
He's a man of power.
That's wonderful!
I'm sloppy.
Can you pick us up?
Can you get there in time?
It's weird the mailman hasn't come yet.
How do we stop that from happening?
I hope Tom will remember this.
Was I really so happy?
What kind of insurance do I have to choose?
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
Have you ever been punished for a quick ride?
I'll be right up.
We have to go.
Tom's a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There's no girl on the Internet.
She tried.

The results were incredible.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes are jammed.
Have you completely recovered?
I'll listen.
Tom spoke very loud.
Don't move!
He recorded an accident.
Did I let it go?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew Tom didn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
It's crazy.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the right side is in New York.

Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Violent criminals were often more violent in childhood.

Tom came to my house yesterday for dinner.
Look at the size of it!
It's a living truth.
You're very indisputable.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now is a great time to buy that.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom got out of it.
Tom got involved with people he never should've gotten involved with.
Tom is visiting us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and write.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's the problem you have to solve for yourself.
I was over-extinguishing.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom dropped the book.
This is supposed to work.
You don't have to judge a man according to his appearance.
It's unconnected.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the e-mail!
I thought I didn't know what was going on.
They'll keep talking tomorrow.
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as his weakest member.
I've been there before.
It's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
What are your plans then?
The kids are sleeping.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Tom closed the door.
I wasn't having fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Tom worked very hard and made a lot of money.
I don't like socializing.
He lived a simple life.
We offered you help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
The first phase is over.
You'll be famous.
He's got a lot of money, even higher.
We're glad to have you here.
Tom was sure of himself.
I wonder how Tom feels.
You're the most boring person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.

Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?

It's important to me.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't give up.
I was used to not like anyone.
The brakes are encrypting.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with the boy?
Tom still knows he's quoting a song he wrote when he was thirteen years old.
Did you see Tom's gone?
Be careful.
How would you get that?
I'm ready to pay you well to do that.
That was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you were gonna be busy.
He's a lot of admirers.
I hope tomorrow's gonna be a good time.
Let's sit down.
Come and look.
Tom really seems familiar.
Do your children have their own rooms?
Tom kept all the letters Mary sent him.
Go swim with Tom.
She's safe.
Tom died in his sleep.
A woman's chauffeur isn't completely without a little black dress.
Finish this.
Tom helped me save that money by telling me about a cheaper place to buy it.
There's nothing you can do except to admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's been working his whole life.
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
Tom will live.
You win!
That's a bad sign.
I got it wrong.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Have I really been so happy?
I'm good with the kids.
I'll be late.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
You should leave Tom a message.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
Tom has a family now.
That doesn't surprise me.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where'd you find the keys?
You'll see her.

Did you see Tom's room?
What did you both do?

I saw the mouse.
Let me sit down.
What do you got there?
It's great.

Please tell me I'm right.
My wife, who grew up in Norway, made me aware from the very first moment that it was no longer the time for a woman to run around her husband all day long.

There's no need to worry about it.
I want to see you.
There's nothing going on with me today.
Something wonderful happened today.
You're not rational.
Let it go, Tom.
I won't tell anyone you did it.
How long is the Nile River?
Why do rabbits have big ears?
Let's protect our legs.
Are you finished?
You should be able to do it.

You underestimated me.
Tom's already here, but Mary hasn't arrived yet.
He's a criminal, you know that?

For what?
Are we safe now?

You can sit next to me.
Are you ready?
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.
My husband lost his job.
Don't lie.
I've always wondered about this.

You're made for me.
Are you busy here?
We're out of food.
Mary made her own wedding dress.
What kind of married life is he?
He's working.

I can't even imagine that.
I have no intention of changing.
I'm getting good at it.

Start counting.
I sing well.
That's a lot about you.
Tell Tom to try harder.
Tom won't let us do that.
Life has become very hard.
Tom was my only son.
It's real.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do that.
Maybe Tom's not hungry.
I always think about it.
I never should've listened to you.
Tom wanted to be okay.
I have to get used to it first.
Please repeat?
Don't you think you should tell Tom about this?

I don't think Tom should say that.
Son of a bitch!
Stop the witness.
I can't forget that.
Who's at the door?
I was waiting.
This money will really help.
It's all the same before the law.
From the moment he saw him, his heart was concerned.
I don't understand the problem.
You must be new here.
Please, come here.
Is breakfast included in the price?
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
Just give Tom a second.
Tell Tom to try harder.
I wish I knew Tom didn't speak French.
I already ordered her.
Check it out.
Have you finished washing the dishes?
I always thought it was weird.
The ring is tight.
All we know is Tom's fault.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Tom pushed his head.
We have therefore set up a small portable cabin that can be divided into two parts and can be driven anywhere.

Please don't say that.

I'm really happy about that.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
I'm not too upset anymore.
Bad weather didn't let me go.
Tom hired a private detective to follow Mary.
I don't like Tom's writing style.
I'm sure Tom will miss me a lot.
I'm sure Tom didn't want to hurt you.
My French isn't so good yet.
Don't you see Tom's upset?
He's a Frenchman.
I think maybe we were too aggressive.

I need a cut.
I think I'll be back in about 30 minutes.
Have you ever wanted to live on the island?
No one cares why Tom's a vegetarian.

Tom taught me how to read.
Tomorrow's a math test.
Smile's infected.
They sell fish and meat.
I recognized him at first sight.
I've never worn a bedroom in my life.
We better get ready.
I'm lying to her.
Tom just told me otherwise.
You're the boss.
He took Jane to dinner.
Who broke the cup?
You're just wasting your time.
What Tom said can't be applied to this situation.
There's a few reasons.
I'm really proud of it.
Stop worrying so much.
I didn't care.
I'm really happy about that.
We missed Tom a lot.
I'm not ashamed of that.
They'll know what to do.
We didn't make it.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
To be honest, I don't know.
I saw the bus.
You're saying you deliberately hid your good side?
Tom's not the one who drank all the milk.
I don't own it.
Tell him.
Do you speak English?
Everyone says I look like a dad.
Come early so we can talk about the plans.
Tom, do you prefer dogs or cats?
He looks young for his years.
I'll always remember your advice.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
Who are you trying to cheat on?
Me and all my brothers share a room.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Looks like that diamond's real.
What did you do now?
I'm sure you can do that.
You can't go into that room.
How old are you?
You'd be crazy to stay.
You tried.
A new snowflake took place on the way to Etèskaret in Oda municipality in Hordaland on Tuesday night, and it is not known whether anyone is trapped in the bay.
I'm claustrophobic.
I can't fix my car on my own.
You know it!
Please hurry.
Tom's got his head up.
Should we tell someone?
He was flooded by the cold.
I'm getting better.
That's what Tom thought.
His memory loss is more psychological than a physical problem.
He's out.
He started messing around.
Tom could be better.
Tom was drowning.
Pauk took your car.
So what if that's true?
He was before his time.
Don't get out of here.
That meant a lot to me.
The effect was much different from what we intended.
Aren't you finished yet?
I'm gonna have to think about that question,
Tom was talking about music.
There were so many people on the train, I had to stand.
I don't have a home today.
Tom and Mary agree.
When can Tom come home?
In a window window, I see a reflection of my face.
Go talk to Tom.
I was thinking about my family.
You could've spared my testimony just to tell me I shouldn't have been here today.
This will make it much easier for us.
I haven't been there long.
Is it true you're going to study in Boston?
Tell me where you live.
Let's go over it again.
Whatever you do, don't leave the board on the toilet.
Shall we see Tom again?
You'll have to ask Tom.
That should save us some money.
He's been doing ten hours all the time.
This one's pretty cool.
How did you find out where Tom was?
Tom's probably still gonna be mad.
They can't recognize each other anymore.
I'm not falling for it.
He's a liar, isn't he?
I'd agree.
The price doesn't matter.
You deserve a reward.
She's very patient.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Will we see Tom again?
Just try to stay calm.
He accepted it as a monster.
Do you know how to cook?
Do we start soon?
You can't enter that room.
You know I don't like eggs.
Go ahead.
The first step is the hardest.
Mary read the full instructions for the work of 321 sides in the spirit.
How old is this plane?
I just got here.
What's wrong with you?
How old are you?
Did it work out for me?
I should be able to explain everything forever.
I haven't worked for many years.
What a beautiful house!
Can you take me home?
What do you have in mind?
It's getting dark.
Don't get Tom on his way.
I really like to practice.
You have to go to school.
That book costs 3,000 yen.
I just started working here today.
She doesn't like to be told what to do.
Modes are getting old and dying.
A large number of words are borrowed from foreign languages.

Basically, my dear Watson.
History is written by the winners.
I'm deep-rooted.
The writer of the book "Last Mohicana", James Fenimor Cooper, was the first fighter to protect nature.
We need to start over.
He has great experience, and his expertise has been broken down into several areas.
Well, that's enough!
I bought a lot of things.
I'm confused.
I assumed you were busy.
It's clear.
Keep digging.
Why are we in this mess?
Tom's self-confidence was broken when his boss took him off in front of his colleagues.
I'm not worried at all.
We have a problem.
Tom knew all that.
Will you do that to me?
I probably won't watch this.
Come in.
Did I call you?
Most are afraid to set a great goal for themselves out of fear that they will never reach it.
I'm desperate.
I know.
That's all I care about.

This building is blue.
I could eat a horse.
It's a really nice day outside.
This must be important.
I'm surprised you didn't know that Tom knew French.
It's third city, by size, in Serbia.
What year has your car been made?
Sit still.
He's a tall boy.
I'm the one who solved the problem.
Where'd they go?
Does Tom know about this?
What can I tell them?
I can't sleep at all.
They couldn't keep going the same way in the second half.
Just give him some time.
How did I get here?
Learn hard.
It takes a lot of imagination to try to add a new sentence here.
Things might have turned out better if you hadn't gone there.
I checked.
Finish this.
He came to visit you yesterday.
Tom's got a bad day.
Don't answer it.
Did the red rose grow?
I'd like to go.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
Pride tends to become a vain thing, which is near the birth of madness.
How long will Tom last?
The rainy season begins in June.
Who knows what's going to happen tomorrow?
I changed my schedule.
I wish I knew I could take pictures like that.
Tom was waiting for me.
Shut up!
Tom says this is absurd.
I've never repented.
We're limiting the luggage to ten kilograms per piece.
We're never going back there.
It's been years.
They set up the Air Force Joint Command, where the director and chief of the headquarters were, respectively, from the Navy and the Army.
Tom took his shoes and started singing.
Will we see Tom again?
Let's consider the worst that can happen.
Walk slowly.
Let's try it.
There's chaos here.
My parents don't like my girlfriend, they don't think it's good enough for me.
Tell me what you wrote.
Tom left this morning without finishing his breakfast.
You don't even know his name, do you?
I'm sorry, Tom.
Such a state of affairs cannot be tolerated.
We never played football before.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't know French.
It's very bright.
When's the meeting?
I could go there now.
I'm stubborn.
Because of the lie, he fell into trouble when his boss found out the truth.
He looks good for his years.
I really like the members of my team.
What did you both do?
We're in trouble now.
It looked so delicious.
I have a stone in my shoe.
Can you give me a sign?
Tell me what I missed.
He asked me to help him.
Tom has a young sister, Mary.
I could have used that.
I was very excited.
Don't yell.
I didn't tell him you were here.
I saw Tom die.
You're in a better shape than I am.
How's that?
I'll try to find them.
I can lose my license.
Tom told me what to do.
I know exactly what to do.
Tom's on his way.
We'll let you know as soon as we find out.
She told me everything last night.
What can I do?
Was I really so happy?
He's overheated the security.
I can't resist anymore.
I could lose my pension.
Tom knows he's home real fast.
She writes to her son sometimes.
Don't talk.
It happened right here.
I'm not too upset anymore.
Tom's worried he's gonna lose.
I think it's best to be kind.
Africa is the cradle of humanity.
Tom has high moral standards.
My favorite lecturer was Jackson.
I'm not the only one who didn't like that movie.

This one's pretty cool.
We did everything we could.
We only need one chance.
I think Tom likes baseball.
What are your ambitions?
I'm compassionate.
Tom used to be scared of me.
I was surprised by Tom's answer.
Do you speak Greek?
Am I a suspect?
Tom's a little boy, isn't he?
Better kiss in the woods than ten in the hand.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
You have to speak louder.
Tom lost his job.
Tom's thrilled.
Did you have lunch?
How much is this gonna cost me?
I'm a hero.
There's a female version for every man.
Are you talking about us?

I just got here.
You just have to practice.
I was so busy with Tatoeb again that I almost dehydrated.
We have to do it.
I know I'm not perfect.
Mary sat on the grass, playing the uculelles.
Before this decision goes into effect, no one's going to move their fingers to solve this.
Do you have anything to report?
I've always hated doing that.
Tom's not a baby anymore.
Welcome to your new home.
Tom must have known that Mary wouldn't want to do that.
Tom's gonna talk.
It wasn't easy for me.
He's speeding up.
Tom tried to help us.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.
I got used to doing it.
It's not the right choice.
Everything's in the report.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
I met some wonderful people.
I had lunch with him.
Are you coming, Tom?
Try it.
Think again.
How's Tom at work?
That's what a doctor needs.
I want to be a man one day again.
Why is that so complicated?
What am I gonna do here?
Tom wears black often.
Do you want to come in?
Maybe I'm missing something here.
Check around.
Our school was founded in 1990.
You can sit next to me.
The danger of falling behind every corner.
Are you sure this is safe?
Nobody agrees with you.
Tom's selling cars.
Anybody for a beer?
My father gave me a lot of money.
I'm not used to it.
I'm glad you answered.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I have an idea.
Tom bought a hulahop.
They'll know what to do.
You're definitely crazy.
Are we ready to go?
I'm free.
Three times five is fifteen.
My mom passed the flowers into the garden.
Tom's not confused.
I have the impression that he's quite arrogant.
Tell him I'm innocent.
It's not a new problem.
Have you ever used any of these?
Her dissertation must be written in English.
Now I have to go.
How hard would it be to do that?
Find yourself a place.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Since she got into the lottery, she went out to the shopping party.
I'm getting harder to concentrate.
Show me the pictures!
I think she's from Austria.
Please wait until I'm ready.
It's always like that.
I'm interested.
Louder, please.
Can you talk to Tom for me?
Get Tom out of here.
Sleep for a few hours.
What happened?
The intelligence satellite is a military satellite capable of overseeing many activities on earth, listening to communication lines, recording the frequency of radar systems...
I asked you last night.
You're very pretty.
I doubt it'll be hard for you to get a driver's license.
It's a depressing story.
You don't look so good.
I'm glad you're back.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Tom and Maria are playing chess with a bunch of hand-picked chess figures allegedly from elephants.
If a command already exists, the system that you can receive and send email will work.
Go talk to Tom.
I'm confident.
Why don't you take off your coat?

Did your girl like flowers?
I'm a little new in this.
This should work.
Nancy's from London.
I'll call.
It's a third city in Serbia by size.

We've got enough here.
We drove him out of the country.
Tom left his key on the table, as he often does.
I'm homeless.
I thought I was stabbed.
I'm just thinking it out loud.
I thought you were going to Boston bus.
Why tell Tom anything?
I could have used that.
I hope I can write two or three songs during the weekend.
You don't know me.
How are Tom and Mary?
Doesn't mean something's a good idea just because it's possible.
He opened the door.
I hope Tom gets back safe.
I like what you wrote.
Don't be bluffing.
Where'd you find this knife?
You need to help them.
Do you have anything to report?
We want complete sentences.
Get your ass over here!
I'm not the owner.
I sincerely hope Tom's predictions will be fulfilled.
If we had arrived here earlier, maybe we could have saved Tom.
Why are you leaving?
It's gold in green forests.
I'm scared.
You met my sister, didn't you?
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Tom's books are translated into many languages.
Who left the door open?
I can't live without a TV.
Tom sat very quiet.

She was prescribed medical cannabis to relieve the undesirable effects of haemotherapy.
Come see me after work.
Are you involved in this?
So you want to learn another language.
What day is tomorrow?
Tom postponed his drink.
Maybe he'll come to see us tonight.
The air-conditioning device's broken.
I'm not like anyone else.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
Get out.
I didn't think you'd want that.
Would you like some more potatoes?
And then something incredible happened.
Such a project would naturally require a rebalancing of the budget.
I'm not sure where Tom is.
I had no idea what to write.
I can write very quickly.
Don't worry, I can do it.
Swimming makes your legs stronger.
I forgot to pay rent.
I didn't do it either.
The guard's in front.
I'll be in my fourth.
We'll go over everything again.
I wasn't worried about that.
It's fun.
Girls like to play the house.
I wish I hadn't done that.
The train arrived in time today, as always.
Do you want to talk to Tom instead of me?
Norway is my new home.
It's stuck.
You'll never catch me alive!
Tom's the youngest.
Has anyone already told Tom about this?
Did you wash the dishes?
Come closer.
Tom's not the real man for that job.
Tom took the kids to the park.
Please stop here.
Tom really looks familiar.
I'm just kidding you.
I'm not ready to go.
How can anyone sleep with all this movement?
Tom could convince Mary to do it.
Was I really so happy?
Are we safe now?
He made her happy.
What were you doing today?
How much am I gonna take?
She was the only one who understood me.
You can't eat just one.
Be careful.
Dogs are smart.
I'll give you what you want.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm going to leave early today.
How adventurous!
Tell me what it is.
Did you finish your homework?
Get out of here!
Who's home?
I'm really happy to be here.
Please don't yell.
Why are you acting childish?
We could only save Tom a few minutes earlier.
I know this is weird.
I'm glad we were there.
Do you have anything to say?
Why did you do that?
Tom was very nice.
I need to buy a new coat because my old man came out.

You got offended about it, even though it didn't even matter, and it was supposed to be something funny on my part, but you didn't see it that way.
Who's got time for this?
I'm still asleep.
Tom's a date-treader.
My stomach hurts.
We've calculated that we can get to that place within two weeks.
I've put all the tests.
Mary works as a waiter in a nearby cafe.
Let me explain.
I forgot the baby surveillance device.
She was reacting to it.
I'm naked.
What do you got there?
So, what's your secret?
This one's pretty cool.
Just be quiet, please.
I don't understand what the teacher says.
I want you a nice week!
Doping is not compatible with my ideological views of sport.
I'm coming to save you!
I'm wearing a flanella pajamas.
I'm scared of dying.
There was only one small problem.
I'm completely alone right now.
That was terrible.
I wasn't convinced at all.
Don't ever say.
I took part in the competition.
Did you eat anything?
France is in Western Europe.
I hope Tom stays here.
Airplanes landing at the airport.
That's all your wisdom!
Tom was wearing a black hat.
You did what you had to do.
Tom always seems dissatisfaction.
We're out of money.
I think everyone's overexerting.
I'm very happy about that.
Tom turned to go.
I'll never mention this again.
Let me show you where to put that.
Why didn't you let Tommy talk to Maria?
Wake up at seven in the morning.
What would I do without you?
I think Tom will be able to help us control this.
I'm already paid.
They're all gone.
Did I call you?
Come on Tuesday, if possible.
We have to be realistic.
Don't look.
They accidentally heard some suspicious activity in the spray, indicating that the bear smelled their food.
I was everywhere in Europe.
Can I help you, sir?
Don't look.
You asked for it yourself.
How is this your fault?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Come to my quarter.
I don't want to live with you.
I'm broken.
Tom's in constant pain.
The other girls in Mary's department were laughing at her because of her clothes.
They're either passing or going through it.
I'll throw myself at it right away.
I'm broke.
Tom and Mary enjoy walking along walks in France.
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
Can you help me translate these sentences into Chinese?
Did you watch?
Are you busy here?
I'm the choice between two options.
We got what we need.
Everything else is irrelevant.
Did you take a good look?
Tom asked me to wake him up in half seven.
We didn't do that.
Did you wash the dishes?
Please, give me those.
How does Tom work?
Be careful.
Do you have any paper I can write for?
He walked on the street.
Do you agree with that?
We just had dinner.
I'm sure they need you.
That's good.
You're one of us.
Do you have a dog?
I saw a cat.
I've been there before.
Tom's book is at the top of Christmas book sales, and it's hard for some book to get out of position.
Tom's working for Mary now.
I'm armed.
Is it necessary to make such a gala?
Did you wash the dishes?
Give me another reason.
Let's have a drink!
I assumed you were busy.
Are you dyslexic?
If only I knew.
Get changed.
That's all I could find.
A large group of people gathered.
I'm working on my project.
It's all well prepared in advance.
I don't count on it.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
They gave water to their horses.
I'll give you everything you want.
The girls wore grass skirts and had flowers around the door.
I'm not feeling well.
Tom's the only feeder in the family.
Maybe he's already gone.
You're wrong.
This could take weeks.
You can format and configure the table for cross-budgets, insert and use regular tables, diagrams, formulas and functions.
I'll stay at the Hilton Hotel.
Which one of you will come with me?
Call me at any time, on my shoulder, you can always cry.
I'm reformed.
What's next?
Doctors are still trying to save Tom.
No one believed her.
Detectives are still investigating.
Tom was fine.
This sad story was written when Tom was in exile.
Tom's not like the other boys.
We'll take the stairs.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis game.
Do you have anything to say?
Get changed.
We should have brought another bottle of wine.
Men want to feel desirable.
She tried.
You don't mind, do you?
How would you feel if you left your wife?
Can you prove it?
Cuckoo.
It's easy to write with this pen.
Are you ready for more?
This pen doesn't work.
Did you see me playing?
I'd rather not be involved at this point.
Tom closed the fence.
I had dinner with him.
I really hope I'm wrong.
Are you busy here?
Tom used to play guitar.
I'm actually a nice guy.
That's what they both like.
It must have been awful.
I'll loan you a work bond if you promise me you won't write anything about it.
My friends live in the same house as I do.
There's a lot of bad people in the world.
Did Tom find him?
Are they in love?
Where to meet tomorrow?
Tom saved Mary.
Latin is the language of the future!
I think everyone's ready.
You'll see her.
Tom has a dark secret.
Did you eat anything?
Let's make this clear.
It's a very interesting bird.
The relationship between the person and the blood group has not been scientifically confirmed.
I thought you were married.
I'm singing.
It's Tom.
I've checked some things.
I don't sing.
I'd like to kiss you.
The kids are playing outside.
Are you coming soon?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
The working group dealing with data transfer, led by Ben Mania, will hold a meeting on 14 January 1999.
Some say that if you hit the raindrop, it'll start to rain.
In my beginning, it's my end.
I just got here.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
What am I supposed to see?
Have you decided what you're gonna do?
Tom knows he's home very quickly.
Are we all here?
I'll be right back with your order.
My sister's playing with dolls.
Identify yourself.
Take the money.
I'm saving to buy a new saxophone.
Don't give up just like that.
I'll give you what you want.
Who did you write a letter to?
Maybe I'll need some help.
Does this mean you don't love me anymore?
I'm not a specialist.
I'm more jealous than I look.
No one's here.
Tom's youngest daughter is his lover.
Tom bought the papers and read them on the train.
I won't be home next week.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
That would be OK.
What do you call that?
How does Tom know French?
I like to watch you work.
Answer me right now.
There's no established policy.
Write down what I'm saying.
The rain finally stops.
I live in an old house.
Do you love your mother?
It was a big explosion.
Tom pointed.
I didn't go outside today.
Did they tell you the reason?
Can you tell me your name?
Look at this.
She saved a living head.
I think we should call the doctor.
You're in a terrible hurry today.
We got Tom at work.
We should be realistic.
She took off her clothes.
Tom's house is for sale.
Tom wasn't satisfied with the results.
I hid under the table.
They're holding me hostage.
Maybe Tom wasn't hungry.
I've been there before.
Tom asked Mary how she liked her new job.
I'm a big fan of football.
What are you going to do with all this?
Mary earns a living by sewing.
Can you get me some water, please?
Where's your friend?
I don't know what to think about this.
I don't like it at all.
Tom's used to winning.
Elementary, my dear Watson.
Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
We're here to pick you up.
I'm trained.
What do you want?
Medicines should not be mixed with alcohol.
Did you see who it was?
When I woke up, the snow fell.
Some people, no matter how long they're at, don't lose their beauty.
I played golf with Tom a lot of times.
Don't talk.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
That's pretty amazing.
Bad things will happen.
Why would Tom come now?
I panicked.
Come on, try it now.
We better get inside.
Actually, I'm not sure.
Investigate her.
She was dressed in red.
What does a Soviet scientist study?
It's all a big joke.
Tom was talking about music.
Have you completely recovered?
We had a hard fight.
Tom's still hiding.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't know French.
Keep working.
Hope's losing out when you're experiencing a difficult situation and a pointless impatience, you have to be strong.
I was laughing.
The new constitution will not solve the problems of Egypt.
Solar energy is clean from energy.
I thought Tom didn't do what he had to do.
I'm not lying to you.
Did you see me dancing?
Did you eat anything?
Tom's not in any danger.
It's too easy.
All men are the same.
Is it clean?
They haven't woken up yet.
It's all free.
Welcome.
We don't have a choice.
I've never really been anywhere.
He's losing his cell phone all the time.
I'm angry.
I'm thinking about going to Australia, too.
I'm sure Tom will win.
Are the Americans really so individual?
You can go play with your friends when you're done cleaning the house.
That's my problem, not yours.
What's your specialization?
I'm twice as old as Tom.
You're the love of my life.
Tom couldn't talk to Mary and he couldn't influence it.
And now that I remember everything I've experienced, I've really learned a lot.
I wasn't too surprised.
The team is as strong as his weakest member.
I've never camped.
There are a lot of honest people in the world.
Don't shout.
When was the last time you heard from Tom?
The Hungarian language isn't easy, but it's wonderful.
That's what I think.
I prefer a tent with a cloud cover, along with a cross-sectioned arrow for wind stability and snowdrops, and this must be a double tent.
Tell Tom I'll say hello.
I can't be something I'm not.
Where are we going to meet?
Do you think what she said is a lie?
Tom didn't do it.
I'm touched.
Tom's fired.
Are you planning on going to Tom's and Mer's wedding?
This candidate is much better compared to his predecessor.
Don't call me while I'm in the office.
Thank you for loving me.
The doctor's investigating the patient.
Tom put his drink on.
This is more than justice.
I could lose my pension.
She's in a bad mood.
I've always known that.
Don't faint.
Every communication is a translation.
I'm trying to be careful.
I'm really happy about that.
I've never been camping.
They believe in God.
Everyone's boss in their house.
Let's hope you're right.
We grew up on a corner.
Are you mad about that?
I've burned my tongue.
You tried.
I thought I could trust Tom.
When there's no news, it's good news.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Did it turn out to me?
Did you sleep?
They were very hard on the court.
Is there a reason why you keep these old bottles?
We talked for a while.
Now I have to go.
Can I get your dictionary?
No one else was hurt.
We have to try.
That cloth isn't from India, is it?
I'll buy what I need tomorrow.
I may be antisocial, but that doesn't mean I don't talk to people.
I believe you're honest.
I didn't pick anything.
Let's try something.
Are you in Paris?
Don't leave me alone.
Tom started learning French last year.
Tom sat on the bench all day, writing postcards.
Aren't you going to eat anything?
It's abandoned.
Don't move!
I've already thought about it.
Money's talking.
I hope Tom will remember this.
Tom told me his father died.
We have to spend less!
I've been parked twice.
I've never seen that before.
Do you want to live in Mumbai?
Tom broke something again.
Tell me where you live.
You have to teach me these days.
I love this store.
I just didn't start looking for you.
He's leading an angry life.
I'm not a rich man.
I really like your music.
That's what I'm used to.
Tom has the right attitude.
Anatomical breast implants, however, can also lead to the deformation of the breast shape if they rotate on the side.
Where did you find the keys?
I won't tell anyone you did it.
She tried.
Tom was a little shaky.
I saw the bus.
Tom's smart enough not to do something like that.
I brought these reports to you to take a closer look at them.
I'm not both rich as much as we would like.
Get on board.
Tom's still mad.
Why are you still awake?
Please don't make me eat that.
I think your work is very good.
Tom helped Maria put on her coat.
Have fun while you can.
The Internet is not your personal army.
I could go with you.
Regrettably, he crossed over to become a powerless, dirty, small, and insignificant man from Almighty God in the corner of the small province of the vast empire.
We should do better.
The weather forecast says tomorrow afternoon it'll rain.
Tom's a gentleman.
I saw a snake.
It's useless.
Which planet are you with?
Are you listening?
Am I in love?
Wait, wait, don't go yet.
Did you eat anything?
Give me another reason.
What did you two do?
Is this your first test?
Life goes on!
Tom's already here, but Mary's not here yet.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
Okay, we made a deal.
Let's not be emotional.
Tom is very patient.
Everything changes.
Tom knows where the wind blows.
Women are the most beautiful in man's life.
When you get your phone, the battery is fully charged.
Tom knows that now.
I volunteered.
Shut up!
Tom likes it the most.
Tom's driving me crazy.
This famous actress was also a fashion icon.
I'm not moving to Boston.
I'm impatient.
I finished learning hope on Duoling yesterday.
Tom attacked Mary's sister.
Am I safe now?
We'll get to work right away.
I did what I could for him.
I'll just say, you're beautiful.
Are you allergic to any food?
Tom's listening because he's convincing.
My suitcase's not packed yet.
Did you sleep?
The readers were in trouble, waiting at least three months before they got the answer.
Do you know anyone who did the last year's exam?
Mary took off for a trip.
They live on a high leg.
Tom came out of the limo.
I'm sure I've seen that guy somewhere.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
I'm buying a lot of stuff in that store.
You don't support me much.
What's he drinking?
You'll see her.
He's all, he's just not fair.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
The police asked the criminal to hand over his gun.
It's human to sin, it's divine to forgive.
I ran all the tests.
I just needed some time.
I have to go.
Please be honest with me.
Tom knows it's hopeless.
What's that?
A man dreams, God determines.
Tom was wearing black farmers.
It must have been fun.
What do you have to say?
That gives me an idea.
Did you just meet them?
It's more art, not science.
Is this place occupied?
It was just like that.
Add more water.
Tom's counting the case.
All parking spaces are full.
This is my brother, Tom.
You use the device until it warns you to fill the battery and then fill it in for 5 hours to reach maximum capacity.
Tom's still pregnant.
You're becoming insensitive.
No, don't do that.
I had a house when I was a kid.
Tom was with the girl, but he couldn't see who he was.
I'm not gonna ask Tom to do that.
They were all standing.
I was pretending I didn't understand.
Would you like to talk to Tom?
Can you give me a remote?
Why are you leaving?
Now's the time to enjoy.
Did he meet his goals?
I just want to go home.
Tom's upset about this.
Have you seen my house?
I have a book.
What do your kids usually have breakfast?
Am I so different?
We had a terrible fight.
Tom's a salesman, too.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
That's exactly what I said it would happen.
Testing a new engine will take place today.
Come and sit down.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
I'll apologize.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
Tom wants to pay off the money he owes.
All things have to go through.
Come on in the truck.
I've never saved that before.
I don't want to do that.
I think Tom was great.
I have a headache.
Tom seems a little nasty.
I loved it so much that my wife knew she was cooking.
I'm proud of my family.
Men have about 7 to 8 times as much testosterone as women.
I have to go.
It was a good hat.
The door's stuck for something.
Tom left right away.
I had lunch with her.
You've taught me so much.
What's bigger, the sun or the Earth?
We'll get you one.
No doubt!
Looks like you've lost ten pounds.
You disappointed me.
We'll throw ourselves at it right away.
May I ask why?
I bought this yesterday.
You did a great job.
The insurer's overheated.
Are we safe now?
Tom says one day he'll do it.
Otherwise, what's your address?
This one's uncomfortable.
She's wearing a gold chain around the door.
Electronics provide multi-stage and simple adaptation of air flow.
Have you heard he finally came home?
During the great days, we see Mount Fudji in the distance.
That's your choice.
They're sitting at the table.
It's a multi-phase process.
I think you were very generous.
Tom could have something to do with it.
Are you dyslexic?
It's not working on me.
The congregation is dissolved.
Tell me what you wrote.
It never occurred to me that someone was going to invent something like that.
Tom was friendly to me.
I can't agree with you.
My father fixed the broken chair.
Let's move the closet.
Tom threw me to the airport.
You know, right?
I'm trying.
I wrote a song about Tatoebi.
I need to catch the train.
I don't rush anywhere.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
That's all I needed.
Let me try.
I paid for it.
I bought a new hat in the store.
I wouldn't hurt him.
I have complete confidence in you.
Have you ever heard such good music?
It's okay.
I think you'll be able to do that.
Stop it, will you?
He shot the ball in the goal!
It's a big day today, son!
We were filled with a happy anticipation.
It's just a personal attitude.
I'm really sorry, Tom.
Did you tell Tom this?
My older sister is very talented to sing.
I'm sorry, but I won't forget.
I always thought it was weird.
Clear your lips with the salve.
Free libraries Haskel and Opera House are built on the border between Canada and the United States.
It's very important to rest properly.
You disappointed me.
You don't have to eat right before you go to bed.
Karin's an Austrian.
I think I understand you.
Tom's personal assistant has a personal assistant.
It was sitting alone.
You have to make a decision.
Every time we talk, he's making me an adrenaline.
Tom's always very nice.
That takes courage.
I have no intention of answering all the questions.
Tom had a stabbing pain.
Stop smoking.
Do you know what that thing is?
Just tell Tom I called.
I'll try to convince Tom to do it.
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
They gave water to their horses.
My father gave me a lot of money.
You can talk to Tom.
Is it all solved now?
Nothing's free.
Vladivostok is a city in Russia.
You were supposed to be my friend!
I wasn't too surprised.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Did you write the report?
Tom turned on the heating.
I want to know why.
We'll get you.
I usually don't buy anything from the Internet.
Someone was here.
Did you write in the journal today?
That's the best thing I've ever heard.
Do you know anyone there who's talking to Urdu?
Tom was shot three times.
Come pick me up.
Tom smiles suffocatingly.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
Tom could explain that.
Let me help you.
Are you a baseball fan?
Why are you mad at me?
I didn't see anything.
We have all remembered the blessing of her almighty grace.
No matter how much he's been considering, I still don't understand.
Tom thinks the same way.
I never borrow anybody's books or CDs.
That was kind of weird.
I don't have a lot of friends.
My children rely on me.
I'm begging you to reconsider.
It can heal.
Don't be a coward.
When they experienced the French Revolution, citizens became free people, freed traditions and churches, and praised freedom, equality and brotherhood.
I didn't think it was appropriate.
Tom offered to help when it seemed that everything went completely wrong.
Translate or not a moral selection of translators, things sometimes sound better if they stay as they are in the language in which they are created.
Look what I grew up in!
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
It's necessary.
What did you do now?
I'm poor.
How long have you lived here?
Do you think the situation will improve?
When he doesn't limit, he doesn't get it.
Don't look.
J. Kepler, an astronomer and a mathematician, did research on the planets and their movement.
That's enough for today.
I've never been camping.
Burj Califa is the world's highest cloud today.
I could help.
She's been caught at work.
I think I know a way to save you some time.
That was rude.
It's a completely unique friendship that has been deepening for many years.
Okay, I get it.
What are you looking for?
Are we all here?
Scientists believe the discovery always comes as a thunder from the sky.
Who's Tom?
The ship's in a hurry.
I agreed to buy it.
It came from nowhere.
They'll meet you.
Let's go one by one.
Don't yell.
The ship disappeared without a trace.
It's accurate.
I've never saved that before.
Did you enjoy watching the night game last night?
Their proximity was mysterious, given that they only met three days ago.
That's what I've been doing.
What year was your car made?
I was trying to be nice.
Don't sing.
It would be good if I wore another layer.
What did I say, brother?
The keys are in the locker.
That's all we can do.
Are those new shoes?
What name?
Why don't you take off your coat?
Where the hell have you been?
She laughed.
Tom just couldn't do it.
I thought you were married.
I'll go if you go.
Well, I have some news.
The odds were against me.
I want to be with her.
What I saw was discouraging.
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
You tried.
Thank you for loving me.
I'm a big football fan.
You make Tom nervous.
Keep working.
There's a lot of bad people in the world.
I thought you were happy here.
I'm natural.
I don't care about dancing.
Don't forget to send this letter.
Nothing happens if he doesn't have a dream.
I was trying to be nice.
Tell him I'm innocent.
Tom is very good at imitating Mary's way of speaking.
Can you solve this problem?
Some of my friends smoke.
You're my princess.
You'll miss everything.
Come on, sit down.
Tom's gonna wait.
Looks like Tom thinks so.
Don't let Tommy sleep.
Come down here.
I'm sorry?
Everyone changes.
Would you like some more apple juice?
We can't lose hope.
Let's sit down.
Buy a litre of milk, and if they have eggs, buy twelve eggs.
Tom wants to know if you're planning on coming to his party.
Did you see me playing?
Why would Tom want that?
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
Tom's a very diosyncrasy.
I'm hurt.
Keep digging.
I don't want any evil.
I was the only man in the tourist group, and the rest of them were Arabs living in Istanbul.
Investigate it.
Tom's not the right person to work.
We need to get better.
They demanded an increase in wages.
Let me see your prescription.
Tom came to help.
Sometimes, they get confused between families, they spread throughout the generations.
Everything's wrong with him.
Tom thinks fast.
Comments need to be on the subject.
Don't get caught.
The programme sets out the conditions for the development and implementation of projects.
We should go again.
Do you feel okay today?
We won.
Give me the spoon.
Can I find you on Facebook?
I was trying to be kind.
It would be confusing.
We're here.
You can sit next to me.
That's what pulled the handle.
Tom was a great manager.
They all fall.
You just have to practice.
Have you ever washed a cow?
There's a lot of orange bakers on the line.
You just have to write a few sentences about what you did yesterday.
I couldn't sit on the train, because there were so many people.
Can you please turn off the radio for me?
Come again.
She's walking.
Why are you still awake?
Tom was a scout.
Why are we in this mess?
Tom's counting the coussor.
I learned hard while I was at school.
I refused to do it.
Should we tell someone?
After five hours in the hot sand, he saw something on the horizon that looked like a desert fatamorgan.
When are you gonna get to the station?
Are you honest?
We'll try your way.
Are you a maniac?
I'll be better now.
And that's it!
I made an apple pie.
Are you a prisoner?
No one's been watching.
If you have to be somewhere right now, it's definitely here!
Tom could be lying.
Good luck.
I've never repented of that.
Tom was pissed off like a rice.
Tom could have a point.
Did I welcome you here?
What did you both do?
Don't you worry.
What an experience!
Tom's learning to program.
Are we done?
Tom's a little eccentric.
Mary came back from school in tears because her friends were harassing her.
I trusted you with my secret and you betrayed me.
I'm writing very fast.
We all did it.
Maybe you're wrong.
I'm sure you'll understand.
I have to pay off the debt.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
His speech was, in fact, a disaster.
We have to save the money to buy a new car.
Bad things will happen.
I thought you'd taken care of it.
What year is your car?
You have to believe it's possible to change.
She translated her sentence.
Did you even ask Tom to serve?
I could go there now.
They're all cheering.
Tom said you were cool.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm glad you answered.
Drive carefully.
Let's see.
Do you have a perfume?
Don't play monkey!
Mary's a little attractive.
It makes you want to hit him like that.
Be careful.
You understand me.
Tom wanted to know what we were doing.
When yelling doesn't help, yell louder!
I think you should talk to Tom about it.
Tom arrived in time despite the storm.
Something wasn't right.
Tom said I was unconcerned.

It's hot in here.

I'm losing.
I don't want to see him anymore.
I'm glad Tom left.
I'm buying a lot of stuff in that store.
You're driving slow.
Tom must have had the key.
Why is that interesting?
Are you involved in this?
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
You're the reason I came.
Tom probably hates me too.
You can sit with me.
Oh, gray cats, please, don't give up.
Just give me a chance.
What's your mom laughing at?
How many people were there?
They're all quiet.

Why don't you come by sometime?
We all did it.
What did you do now?
Answer me right now.
Why are you mad at me?
Don't forget we have to do it at home.
It would be nice if you'd wait for me.
They were sitting in the circle.
I want to meet Tom.

Do you like it or not?
Life goes on!

What's on your mind?
I gave them a present for the anniversary.
This isn't drinking water.

Was I really so happy?
Do I have a reason?
That's how I figured it out.

Come on.
What do you mean?
Tom wrote Mary's phone number.
It's a good chance we'll win.
The meeting lasted an hour.
I can walk all the time for only about three kilometers.

Go upstairs.
That doesn't matter.

We haven't met yet.
I'm not old.

Tom himself ate the whole box of chocolate.
Can we do this later?
The truth has to be said.
Do you like costumes?
Didn't you do enough?

Who else is using this room?
You'll save time if you listen to my instructions carefully.
He's tired of reading.
Can we order now?
We can't stop here.
Tom didn't even think he'd try to convince Mary to do it for a second.
Hey, give me a chance.
There's also an ethical question that's been asked about this.
It just happened again.
They all survived.
Bad things will happen.
Do you love your mother?
I'm really proud of that.
This is my third marriage.
What have you done here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
I don't completely agree with that.
It's a routine thing.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will anyone tell me what to do?
Tom writes better than me.
There's nothing going on with me today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing well.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom pressed the switch.
I need my kids.
The teacher wrote something on the table, but I couldn't read because it was too little.

That was a false alarm.
Tom's learning programming.
Anyone can get the wax.
Tom didn't let me answer Merina's question.
Whenever I find something I like, it's always too expensive.
It's a cat.
I want Tom to leave by noon.
Tom seemed surprised.
Tom wasn't very energetic.
It won't help if you worry.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
Have you gone to see Tom?
I've been looking for you.
I'll go by car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know what question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
I'm taking a day off.
Are you blaming me?
That broke the mood at the table yesterday.
I thought you were going to Boston bus.
Tom's still got some time.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
Just waste your time.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
I've never had trouble sleeping.
It's locked.
I'll figure something out.
An honest man can't do that.
Take care!
I won't try to predict the future.
What are you doing at this time?
I'm early.
Are they all strong?
Is everything worked out now?
Please send me a doctor's account.
What's this about?
I want you a nice day, Tom.
Are you going to Tom's and Mer's wedding?
I'm a little new in this.
I improvised.
"Do you know what's going on?" "No, what's the matter?"
That's what they both like.
You and I need to talk.
You spyed on me.
The pen I write belongs to Tom.
Where did you see Tom?
It's time.
What's this gonna buy me?
Wake up!
We're helping each other.
Tom and Mary are still good friends.
How did you do that?
I won't tell anyone else.
How do you know that?
Tom suffocated his smile.
I'm scared.
What name?
Is Tom really a student here?
Tom's the one who wrote this story.
Everybody's going.
I didn't spend anything.
It's an area with a lot of new houses.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom seemed pretty nervous.
Tom likes sports.
Tom took off his wig.
It just happened that I was right.
Her name was unknown.
I'll save Tom.
Don't come near my girlfriend.
I'm sorry I tried at all.
I'm not upset at all.
Jumi is one of my friends.
He just needed some time.
I didn't think you'd do that.
I'm sorry I'm so late.
Maria started taking off.
Upstairs, downstairs.
Life without love doesn't make any sense.
I'm sure there's a better way to do that.
I'm firmly against this.
You underestimate me.

The police didn't reject the possibility of suicide.
This was on the list.
She was dreaming of becoming a nurse.

Tom took off a bottle of wine.
This will last forever.
I'm so excited.

I'll tell you everything I know.
Don't stop.
Close the window.
Tom missed his goal.
I totally disagree with you.
Get out of here.
Let me do it again.
They live there.
This book will help you write effectively.
Don't talk.
Tom made a fool of himself when he was drunk last night.
I work in Milan.
Come back in a day.
There was a lot different effect than the intended effect.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
Everyone laughs.
I loved going to the beach.
Where's your father?
I'd agree.
It's all over.
The book was distributed.
Tom almost died trying to save me.
That's what needs the truth.
I loved going to the beach.
At first glance, it looks easy.
It's time to say good-bye.
You were supposed to be my friend!
People need to stop hating.
I don't doubt he'll make it.
I never advised you to do that.
I'm not going to change.
Tom started the car.
My grandmother's dad's enjoying the tea ceremony.
She laughed.
They've all been wrong.
Are you coming back now?
Tom kept it a secret.
We went to school together.
We're doing this wrong.
We'll get you one.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
In accordance with our rules, all participants have to show the legitimacy, registration of papers and licenses during the inspection.

You always work.
There are situations in chess in which it is paid to sacrifice the figure to gain advantage for a long time.
Young children should learn to feel comfortable with animals.
You're not finished yet?
You're not the one who died.
That's hard to imagine.

She's walking.
My mother loves music.
Would that be possible?
What did you two do?
Draw a sketch of your house.
Tom postponed his drink.
I'm pretty shocked by this.
Spice is empty.
Tom made up his mind against it.
I'm grateful.
I couldn't do this without your help.
Don't answer it.
If you did that for me, it would help a lot.
He was naked and boobish.
Tom may be honest.
Can you explain to me how to get to the airport?
Look again.
The first step is always the hardest.
They have to drink water.
Now I'm a little worried.
What's in there, Tom?
Help yourself.
I'm totally out of money.

I'm happy to agree.

The horse's here.
Everybody's asleep.

Would you like to come with me?

Tom can be dangerous.
Are these your bags?
What did you do to me?
Don't jump!
When he was six years old, he learned to type in a typewriter, and he told his teacher he shouldn't learn to write with his hand.
I've been practicing.
That doesn't sound very convincing, but I believe you.
I think I'm gonna go out and eat.
Can we talk outside?
You have good instincts.
I thought I played well.
Am I safe now?
Please write.
We didn't have this in mind for you.
Tom's selling cars.
He started screaming.
Tom was clearly shaken.
Did you see who it was?
I didn't know you were so rich.
I'll never see her again.
Everybody down!
I could talk to Tom.
Do you believe in God?
We fell in love last night.
Was I really so happy?
Tom never had to do that.
You don't often hear that someone bought a hat for a thousand dollars.
Come here.
That's what I'm used to.
Do you doubt me?
Tom's been working his whole life.
What language do they speak in Mexico?
That's what they both like.
Something's happened.
Help!
I already ordered it.

What's your name?
Where did you get that?
Tom's a really nice kid.
I can't concentrate on this movement.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis game.
Swimming is a kind of exercise.
The government fell after the vote in parliament.

We don't know what he's bringing tomorrow.
What first instrument did you learn to play?
I'm impressed.
There's nothing left.

I'm not losing hope.
I have a plan, don't worry.
You took my place.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.

How long has Tom stayed?
People tell me things.
Cheers!
Tom's in the pajamas.
Did Tom believe you in the story?
I was very tired so I went to sleep early.
It's hard.
Tom thought I was wrong.
I don't want any of you.
How's it going?
Don't argue with me.
Tom's also a salesman.
I want to feel important.
We'd give everything so it wouldn't happen.
I think Tom needs help.
Switzerland needs better apples.
Are you involved in this?
Everybody's standing.
I pretended I didn't know Tom.
You can never make shit so you don't smell it.
Don't hurry.
No one can know everything.
I'm objective.
I'll leave early today.
Are my red ears?
He's not a doctor.
That's enough.
What instruments can you play?
Employees can be motivated by good, fair wages, a chance to work on a good team or on exciting tasks, and with clear economic incentives such as bonuses and opportunities for progress.
I doubt I'm the only one who noticed.
That's encouraging news.
Give me the sugar, please.
I'm really sorry about this.
You're funny.
Merry Christmas!
Have you ever seen one?
We had a lot to drink.
It's too loud for me here.
I doubt it'll be hard for you to get a driver's license.
Did you manage to do that alone?
Is everything settled now?
How can it be that mathematics, which is still only a product of human thought independent of experience, is so amazingly adapted to objects in reality?
Look at that.
Looks like Tom's a real person.
I didn't know you were so rich.
Look at this.
The code is Muriel.
I had lunch at speed.
That's what he took.
His wife took his shirt off.
Someone told me about it.
Proud of pride!
To change the red meat, I cooked turkey breasts in the sauce from the pancakes for tonight.
I'm always ugly.
Tom's fighting like crazy.
I've always liked horror movies.
Something just happened.
I couldn't stop crying.
You're getting tired.
They're not mine.
I double the prices.
Could you do that?
A video of the interview was made and published over the Internet.
Tom got drunk and drowned his grief after that one night of drinking.
Why don't we rest for a while?
Go take a look.
Tom just wanted to say something.
It's over.
Is it true that Tom killed himself?
I'm here to play baseball.
Do you think so?
I didn't even do that.
Do you have anything to report?
I say that all the time.
Don't lie.
Will you take that?
I'm on my way.
Is Tom coming back?
You're smart.
How did I get here?
Why?
Tom dropped his breath.
There's a lot of work I need to do before I can go home.
By the way, where do you live?
Do you have any questions?
It's hard for me to understand French when it's spoken quickly.
It's about to be half three.
They'll know.
Tom bought some black shoes yesterday.
I've got a lot of friends.
Chirih is considered one of the major financial centers.
He's very rare.
Tom wanted to be good.
I just don't rush.
Don't look.
How desperate are you?
Let's not get undressed.
It's not getting worse.
Answer me.
I'm still making mistakes.
Tom's got a hard job.
I'm glad we won.
You can't go into that room.
"Are you better?" "No, I'm worse."
It's all passing away, but good memories live.
I was in the mountains.
It's hard.
What's easier?
Did you wash the dishes?
We had a hard fight.
It was a drop that swallowed the glass.
He doesn't like us.
We'd save time if we went down Park Street.
A cop arrested him for driving in a drunken state.
We're gonna be crazy.
That would be great.
The knife is not sharp.
We hope people like it.
We all have a price.
That's what gave it an idea.
I got lucky.
No one knows me in Boston.
Tom thinks something's wrong with some politicians.
Where's Tehran?
Go through any obstacles with this monster from the truck!
Mary spends a lot of time on the phone, sending messages and e-mails to her friends.
He always wears dark clothes.
Good luck was on our side.
Tom works for his father's company.
I want to help you.
We never lose hope.
Men stay kids for the rest of their life.
Now we need the truth.
I need to be here all afternoon.
Didn't I teach you anything?
Why are you asking?
It's big.
What's fast is a bite.
Come sit next to me.
I found his book.
I barely managed to hide my bitterness for her insanity.
Butter is made of milk.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Everything's better.
Do you want to see something specific?
I miss her.
I've passed the test!
Let us help you.
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
Please, don't fight.
Does he still have a temperature?
Tom was crazy, you know.
Tom put the map on the table.
Who are you running from?
What did you do to me?
I'll talk to Tom about this.
I'm still a little tired.
We can't go back.
We'll visit you from time to time.
Tom didn't have the courage to do what he wanted.
His comment is easy to understand in the wrong way.
Are we meeting tonight?
