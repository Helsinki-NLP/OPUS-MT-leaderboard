It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How are they treating you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped worrying.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That'll take time.
Why don't you go get him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're cold.
I'm walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I address you?
Do you like the point?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom didn't give me enough help.
I'm not gonna use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We've only met once.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's give them a break.
How much is it worth?
Our water was up to the goose.
Tom pretended he didn't notice Mary seeing him.
What are you usually doing on Monday?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom's not my father.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He's probably still there.
It looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
No one knows that.
The departure was delayed.
Breakfast is from seven to nine o'clock.
Tom came back last week.
Everyone was scared.
I've seen it before.
You made a good choice.
The nudists consider the nudists to be normal.
We sat down and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
They kidnapped me.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist attitudes in public.
You know who I'm talking about?
That's mine.
The wolves decomposed the flock.
That song has haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll be there.
Did Tom pay for the cottage?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
The racists are stupid.
Are you happy, Tom?
Did you shoot a gun so far?
I love that tattoo.
Get a card for a pocket.
I don't want to surrender to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you later?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they been doing so far?
Tom's a homeless man.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for the damage.
No one trusts Tom.
The watch was guaranteed.
And meet tomorrow?
I should have known you were gonna be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ringing.
Tom did as Mary told him.
Show us where you found him.
I thought I'd never find him.
Competition for that job is big.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom is aware that he was not a good father, so he's trying to make amends.
Tom can't change.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have to admit something.
He had an influence on alcohol.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's a little messy in his cheeks.
Nobody cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would say no.
I have to help him.
He's critical.
You'll understand when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom broke his stomach.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go to the picnic with John.
Don't be a jerk with me.
I think you did it.
We're not made of monkeys, but we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
When do you usually have lunch?
I consulted with him.
Have you ever thought about giving up?
It's been a long night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop calling Tom off.
What could go wrong?
When am I gonna get to Boston?
Tom was eating later.
Are you helping?
Are you two relatives?
He wants an egg ham.
Just put it on my account.
I'd rather go by the subway than by the train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my account.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did he give all of himself?
Mary's taking over the movie.
She's got a nice manuscript.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
I wrote Tom this report.
Are they buying like this?
It doesn't look so good.
Hey, can you get that back to me?
That was personal.
I better go, too.
Excuse me for a moment.
Take off your hat.
Acting is very good.
Please don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I'm not gonna be alone here.
He asked me to look at him.
We'd better not get out of this storm.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do we really eat pizza this early in the morning?
Can you come back?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He's gone.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
I'm always running my nose when I'm real.
We met several times.
Nobody liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The moon's surface is incorrect.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way you can understand.
Everybody's looking for luck.
Did anyone else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom was awfully treating me in the middle.
Tom wore a hat that was still worth it.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
There's got to be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to call for help.
That's what you said in the paper.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree to that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him.
Tom's been obedient, and he's even humiliated.
Where did Tom open?
Mike said he'd come.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're human beings.
You don't make a man with a cap.
She tried herself.
Run!
Is it paid for the delivery?
I want my tails.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a weak heart.
Did you buy them for me?
You didn't see that, did you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
The mosquitoes carry malaria.
You've been delaying this for too long.
I don't understand.
That's sad.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you do, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We're taking checks.
The paper is worth a dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom's drinking a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You hit one.
Macedonia has four Google ways: explicit, conditional, ordered and passed.
They haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The peaceful surface reflected her drawings as a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are right for me.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're champions.
You scared Tom.
That's quite right.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw trash on the ground.
I remember how I met the queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom seemed angry.
What will be the Japanese economy next year?
That's how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How come you don't sleep?
They're giving me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a bullet.
I have to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our yard is big.
It's a children's game.
Tom doesn't hate you.
I'll be back in six and a half.
Tom took me to a bitch's mother.
I wasn't there for an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show must go on.
Make a good standing scandal.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to?
Don't draw attention.
I almost got out of my mind.
Pick your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
We're not losing gas.
Tom's a mess.
Who do you have on the list?
He's got a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait here for him?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you took Mary's flowers?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Can I go with you?
Tom seems pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about is food.
Be careful not to sneak into the muddy bar.
Both of them had a fight.
The train passed through the tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We didn't wait for them.
Are the meals included in the price?
That would follow.
Do you want tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
Sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the day of the end that they will try to escape.
Everyone's gone crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom knows Mary from the garden.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still valid.
I'm here to look for her.
It's all wrong.
Why are you working for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom, the police have already questioned him.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still don't believe Tom left.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
Looks like you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's in his room.
No survivors.
She was supposed to shut up.
I'm not like you!
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
They're just laughing.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop him, Tom.
I'm stuck in his locker.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do the job.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were more than a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
It was especially difficult for the king to keep his mouth shut because of the harsh speech.
She didn't accept the invitation.
Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
The bag's too heavy.
The timing is flawed.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels were in vain trying to drown the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in prison than to escape.
I'm getting sick.
When do you learn?
Tom found it hard to swallow the pills.
It's worth quoting a famous passage of his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom's pointless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by human beings.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get to it right away.
Didn't you hear me say that?
Hey, take a walk.
Don't eat too much.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Pull out the hooker.
I don't have plans for tomorrow.
Tom came forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise.
So you didn't want the reward?
Look at the demon.
I'm glad you're glad.
Don't be honest.
Why can't you go now?
You'll learn to appreciate your health when you're sick.
Look at the star that shines.
I don't know how to help him.
Get in touch.
Make him admit it!
None of them know.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory is dead.
We've been bankrupt.
Everybody knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me?
I like school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you need to renew your passport?
Mary has no courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
It's Tom's.
There's no chain height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm so retarded!
We discussed this.
Tom caught the ball.
Where's the nearest club?
Let them call me.
The power grid heats the ceramic plates from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll give me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of war.
In the woods, monkeys were coming down from the crescents.
Let's forget for now.
Because of his father’s sudden death, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're quick to get the data.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll take it all off.
I don't know.
At first, I didn't take it.
He's stuck in his sleeve.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he's not cold.
We're trying to help him.
They're all gone except for him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you were playing chess.
It's dark.
The pipes are closed.
I hurt you, didn't I?
Tom doesn't know how to drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
He's been knocked over.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in the tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom mistakenly told everyone that I was dead.
I think we found one.
The reporting deadline is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was beautiful.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly examined the situation.
Tom's just a normal man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who'll help her, not you.
Most whales feed on planktons.
We need to get out of here right now.
I'm ready to do that.
The water came to my knees.
Let's make the cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
Unfortunately, you'll have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
Silvia liked the concerts very much.
Invite them to join us.
Where do I park?
Does anyone care?
How do you feel about that?
Tom was drinking from the bottle of wine.
I fell off the dot.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
You mind?
When does this show start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks are torn apart.
Tom told Mary to donate money.
I got him with me.
Didn't your name be Cookie's old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But she's a liar.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel so good today!
Tom didn't approve the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with it.
Did she ask for money?
Hold him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multi-phase process.
I have a little gift for him.
This is my plan.
You're talking too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom's not shy at all.
Tom's running down the slope.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
Senfov's really hot.
We're advertising our products on TV.
I was kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That happened almost thirty years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that before.
You were a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I need to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a kibrit?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me in the head.
Anybody in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say "no"?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom was gonna panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's almost got to go.
You should try this.
I expect a call from them.
They blocked him.
Tom's getting sick.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, he didn't get what he was hoping for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it so obvious?
Tom really needs help.
You have to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom found me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that enough?
Tom stretched out your hands.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says the previous dentist told him he'd take his pills off of nicotine if he stopped smoking.
Don't expect everyone to share your thoughts.
That's exactly what Tom suggested.
It kind of seems wrong to me.
Tom's a smart guy.
Carito in the right is a mixture of more spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything he said.
This was a hard night for me.
Tom was driving through town with an elevator without notice.
Yeah, anyway.
You want a camp?
Who broke the cup?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to turn Mary out of the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom seems suspicious.
Take care of it for yourself.
You got it now, don't you?
I'm pretty excited.
I'm not employed.
My old English teacher must now be turning into a grave.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly, not realizing that their own conduct is undesirable.
He's wearing high heels to make him taller.
Do you want some bowling?
I'm sorry, I think you dropped something.
You just need to talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't cry.
I'm here with Tom.
Tom was totally humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
What's it got to do with that?
We're finally meeting, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house is not big enough for our family.
He gave up the idea.
I must sound funny.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
That's how you feel.
Did anyone hit Tom?
We have a rule here.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom won't be very effective.
The day was so nice that we decided to plan.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used inflexible expressions.
Your coffee's getting your energy!
Tom was a nice man.
It's a big mercacy for football.
Why did you ask me that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the darkness.
We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom works in NASA.
Tom's writing.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom writes his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They've got to throw away the idea.
Tom's really upset.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all experience her behavior as negative.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Who's this?
Get away from her.
His eyes lit up with anger.
Why did you call?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom refused to help Mary.
It's possible Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can do anything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask.
You gave me a word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "So do I."
There are many birds in the forest.
Please let me stay.
Come on, walk.
He just wanted to meet Tom.
You need to ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
It's possible Tom was richer than we thought.
I never meant to cheat on you.
What the hell was all this for?
I don't have such a wish.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your soy.
I'm sorry.
I can't find the hotel address.
Smoking means suicide.
The hard shells, the peppers, and the peppers are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's burn the fire.
I wanted to get you what you could as quickly as possible.
What's your hat?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom's wearing his knee.
Where do the pinions come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made of skin.
I have to rest.
Can I take a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom did, and the crowd was picking up.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very well, but he didn't make it.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink gassed drinks.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost got a heart attack.
I recognize the guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Bring her in.
You're cooking a peanut.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going, so let it be.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan drank five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I've given up smoking the curses.
I know how it sounds.
Tom apparently didn't stop him from sitting alone.
I already feel much better.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
It's a shame the concrete doesn't burn.
Why does Tom do this?
Tom stopped all of a sudden.
My father brought me here when I was young.
You're such a bug.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try and find Tom.
I knew I was supposed to shut up.
I'm cursed.
Tom's here before.
He was drying his wet clothes off the fire.
He's always hooked up with his knowledge of English.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have any blankets?
No part of the pig has fallen.
She bought some bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are beautiful.
What happens next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
The cars have four wheels.
Tom's passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom's packing his bags.
How does that benefit you?
That's very useful.
Tom was vibrating his phone.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not coming back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl slowly checked.
It turns out you're an unexpected word of beauty.
Your prejudices have saved you a lot of time, and you can form opinions without needing the facts.
That didn't work out very well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom wasn't having lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Because the note was written in French, I couldn't read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
The room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open my head.
This was Tom's idea.
I decided to let you go back to work.
Tom couldn't hold on.
Tom is still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear.
Tom laughed at Mary.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom, think about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your chain.
That's not a big priority.
Take this.
How long is it now?
Do you understand?
I couldn't help her.
Tom was always getting everything he wanted.
You won't make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know he'd do anything for your red eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom leaves on the ice.
I'll never capitalize.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
That's the first skull I see this spring.
Do you want to play?
Why did he let us go?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems fun.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Watch out!
Linda was pregnant, and she's suspected of being pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Take me to 2:30 from the front gate.
The meeting started over an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll work as I know and I can.
I got money.
You can study here.
They didn't tell Tom why Mary wasn't there.
Tom's getting better.
Tom threw the arrow.
They're not cocoons.
I'm not safe here.
To my great regret, Mary came to the party in a wild dress.
I'll tell you what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything.
The worst kind of mamuruk is the emotional mamuruk.
Let's get serious.
The bees remove the bag to collect the honey.
I need to help them.
Don't turn my back.
I'll never forget him.
Tom won the fight.
You brought them here right now.
Tom lives abroad.
Do they work here?
Tom's eyes lit up when Mary ran into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you help us at all?
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting next to the river.
My cat's hungry.
We need some tools.
Be merciful.
That doesn't seem quite possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There's a lot of big cities in Brazil.
I haven't solved that puzzle yet.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he is.
Tom was moving his toes.
You know me better than you do.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
This isn't blue, it's purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Lambs usually kill them before they've filled a year, so they eat people.

I wasn't here.
The question is when.

The waiter was rude.
That's not good enough.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they scared?
I'm wearing my passport.
It was a reek-work about what they talked about a lot.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she'll be back.
I don't have any pens.
When should we start worrying?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom wants vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They concluded that the ship was sinking.
Did you buy the cure?
Did Tom drink?
It hurts my job.
The question is who will do that.

They despise him.
Are they all happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about that, okay?
I need to call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's pissing me off.
That's a reasonable compromise.

Please, ask me what it is.
Hey, what's up now?
I'm not ashamed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom's a wanderkind.
He's going to school.
It's starting to get in our head that we can't ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very clever.
Now the question is, what should we do?
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
He's finished fourth of 56 runners.
Don't cry.

These animals are under threat.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the gate open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned around to see her.
Don't you dare ask them that.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has enormous potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We listened carefully so as not to miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so excited tonight?
Tom's down the stairs.
We're getting too big.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late for a reward.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes get angry, and they get better as soon as he drinks a couple of beer.
You have merciful eyes.
You don't understand business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
If so, he'll fix it... when the worm gives birth to the grapes.
Tom's a counselor.
Can I talk to you?
You hurt me by calling me an ass.
Since when's he got a fire?
It's possible Tom was lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same thing as you.
I didn't betray anything.
I thought you were yesterday.
I know where to look.
Tom wrote me a letter.

We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've been looking everywhere.
What was the point?
In each section, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Is it over your head from me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was furious.
Tom needed advice.
My laser printer knows how to scan images.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe it?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that picture is.
Everybody's up.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Keep me happy!
The concert's over with the folk hymna.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not moving.
Wait a second.
I have something to do with.
Your propaganda isn't interesting.
He was running as fast as he could.
I won.
Every nuance is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I don't have a comment.
I think he's hiding something?
I hope there's a total of enough air here.
She married a man of zeros.
The wind's cool.
Nothing's changed.
You don't have to wear anything dirty.
The old man died before he died.
I don't like this book.
Luckily, I hit him.
What would Tom be looking for?
The sun is a star between billions of others.
I've got some spasms.
Can someone help me?
We're leaving this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do this.
I need to get over him, Tom.
You can ask yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you ask Google for her?
It's not yet spring.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't mind me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
This mystery is solved.
Tom was hospitalized.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in the park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, that's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's exactly what I'm looking for.
Are you sure we shouldn't order first?
The one who can hear the butterfly laughs knows and how the clouds taste.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom's going to surrender.
Just find them.
I can't go out with them.
They pulled the trigger to see who's going first.
I gave him a chance.
You have a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar isn't to hunt like goods!
But if I were in Brazil, I would be much more afraid.
Did you work as a bartender so far?
Did you forget that again?
I don't like it at all.
I just finished my work time.
Where will this product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have a flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food is cold, warm it in a microwave oven.
The river's right of us.
Tom's not an old man.
This looks too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he had saved.
I think it's time for you to leave now.
The guy's a bandit.
It's possible Tom saw it.
Tom's a little bit of a bitch.
Tom's very unsuspecting.
What did they learn?
How's the wheel of the cylinder?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he's got a drink.
They took your company from me.
Tom, you have to get up.
Tom wants a rematch.
Tom put a fork in the drawer.
Will I be replaced?
I need to get some help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too cool for me.
The whales look like boobs.
Dan married Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally understand.
Tom seems shocked.
Are they brothers?
"Did you like his music?" "No, but you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he doesn't want to eat in that restaurant.
He's getting ready to go back.
This will make our work much easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would I get out of here?
He took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do it.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He's got wine.
His feelings were not restored.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of the funeral marches.
We're probably lying.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, tell me so I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he wouldn't be able to do much about it.
I like this.
Swallow your hands.
I can't believe we actually did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family, just as I am.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a bunch of questions.
Who's handling things here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
I'd never accept it.
It's gonna get cooler.
What are you drinking?
The way it came - the way it went.
His legs were in the morning.
Tom left his keys.
Everything stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any new accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me the location on the map?
Tom's unstoppable.
What's the matter with you?
Tom went to the needle.
Look ahead.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Are you upset, Tom?
This is my newest turn.
I haven't been good for two days.
It's a piece of wood, it's a simple screw.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know what the difference between the brain and the donkey is.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
The rain coming out is not considered.
I'll tell them to go now.
Tom wasn't supposed to marry Mary.
I've got a rape.
There was no living soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you in a long time, guys.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Do you want to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was throwing Mary with a fucking egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take it.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes any sense.
I set them up.
What are the symptoms of poisoning with mushrooms?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I want to watch porn with lesbians.
And who are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure John writes his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that keyboard card?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom's worried right now.
I have no feelings for her.
I guess I was expecting a little better.
I already believe it.
She writes a letter to her mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom was acting like he was surprised.
It was impossible for the boy to cross the river.
Tom had arrived earlier than Mary.
The feeling was late.
We want to know about them.
Have a good time.
The old house has some charm.
This is a taboo.
We barely got saved.
Did they hire you?
It's raining.
Tom could see Mary texting.
You'll be better off.
Tom was a little shocked.
Let's do this right.
You can cross Hawaii for a whole year.
Tom was motivated.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
Most people think that computers will never be able to think.
I'm such a coward.
Brother, you can't just come over to a woman and scratch her-- it's counted as sexual abuse.
I decided to tell her I love him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm the first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You're losing.
We've wrapped up the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's sitting down.
You can't do what you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
He was breathing a lot.
I'm a patient man.
It's not happening here.
It's better to be optimistic and lie than to be a pessimist and be right.
The water was milk.
I'm waiting for the traffic lights to change.
The boy was quiet.
The body of the ship is divided into several watertight parts.
Because of what you were cooking, I'm gonna wash the dishes.
Let's leave the subject.
Tom knows something that doesn't tell us.
When are you going home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose your condition.
He's got fake drops.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear a knock?
I won't wait for them.
You don't have to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?" "Oh, no!"
He's no longer that shy boy what he was.
Can you tell me?
Don't make a scene now.
What was Tom told?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
There were boys all over the world divided into groups. Some played twins, some tiles, some ball, and others rode a dot or rode wooden horses.
Doubts destroy friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk in the bottle yet.
We both have to go.
The pain that causes love is a message of pleasure.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
You have to go home.
Come on over here.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We'll find her.
You misjudged her.
Wait till I check the manual.
The energy comes from inside.
Nobody trusts them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
You've got your head on.
We're in.
Give the seat back.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want to get my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom's growing up.
I can't find the equation.
They're listening to the concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how that was found there.
I'm not satisfied.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please, keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm angry.
It's less wet than yesterday.
It's hard for me to make new friends.
It's strange how people in the tropical zones eat cooked food like cari.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do anything?
Tom had no family.
I can't determine what the baby wants, because it's pointing at both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Although he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom's got a terrible crush on him.
I'm raising orchids in my glass.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go get Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim was never a stranger.
I turned off the TV.
That's a fake sign.
Tom was fighting.
I said it might turn around.
I need you to open my door.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like that happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Do you know how to fix things?
Go ahead.
I forgot his address.
You're handy?
I'll give her another chance.
Tom was with me all morning.
Her bottom has a ladder on one side.
Let's be late for something.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing well.
She can't read or write.
You hurt Tom's leg.
Get in there.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You have very nice lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom's gonna get out of jail by then.
The most expensive thing is the country.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom made a list of the things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
It's sour milk.
We've been out of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why are you arguing?
I'm sorry, I don't have a prayer.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy the temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That'd probably be a problem.
Figure out how much money we'll need next year.
I burned a kibrit in the dark.
How much does she do there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you up at six o'clock?
Tom's sitting back.
Which country is Boston?
Tom's very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of a computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I was burning my lungs, I was just walking into my room, waiting to recover.
Don't thank me yet.
My cat's happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom was playing on the piano.
I'm clean.
I ate a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You heard exactly.
Tom's got a headache.
Oh, no.
There's no one here.
That's not recommended.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
He did all he could.
He's a lacquer.
First of all, let's talk about what Tom should do.
My mom's buying a toy.
I'm not gonna risk it like that.
This house needs repairs.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom's a runner.
Tom doesn't listen.
They want everything you told them you'd give them.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something in it.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many respects, women and men are quite different.
I go fishing every week.
What's the matter?
Is that necessary?
Tom's stuck.
I'll never let you down.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well dried up.
I thought I'd ask for their help.
Maybe you should call them.
Some people don't like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What do you got to do with this?
Is your dog barking?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German doughnuts.
At the time, we were 18 years old.
I'm making thirteen dollars an hour.
It's dangerous to go through that desert.
I want broccoli, but I hate carophilia.
I'm upset when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom's gone.
Go on with that.
This is disgusting.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he doesn't know what Mary wants him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
Is Tom hurt?
They drank you.
Tom started to complain.
I think you should pick her.
It's consistent.
You're beautiful.
Tom's lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out the candles and imagine your wish.
Come on, open it.
Tom looked at Mary cruelly.
Tom was wearing a duxer.
Tom seems decisive.
I'm glad she didn't call.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended he didn't know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you ready now?
How long has it been?
They're not burning.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if possible.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom's a joke.
It was much worse for me.
Tom's trying to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you there yet?
I've only had one glass.
No one's writing to me.
Tom broke his heart.
How do they do that?
That's all I'm asking.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom's my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to speak with his mouth.
They've all been under control.
Every customer has his own rights.
I only call you as much as I can hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they looked at me.
I know Tom's address.
What'd you do last time?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is a pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
The statement is wrong: I'm going to the market because the car's broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
They chose us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom's not invited to a party often.
He doesn't look like his dad at all.
Tom's not quite a threat.
It was midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Did you change the shampoo?
Tom was looking around, he was expecting something to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
It's hot here, you can take off your coat.
I don't think they followed me.
They don't have a defense.
He often helps others.
Tom's a big pessimist.
You're entitled to a phone call.
The skiing was actually much more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's go home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's get that guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remember their debts.
I don't want to get in.
Their friendship grew rapidly in love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'll stop.
I turned the lamp on.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill in the form.
I don't think of a party like that, but how you like it.
Do you think Tom would like to go with us?
Yoga comes from India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom's slamming his toast with butter.
We have work to do.
I heard him smell.
Should we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives there, on the hill.
I'll accept anything.
It won't be okay.
Dan never meant to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What's your favorite French wine?
It'll be Christmas soon.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is a misconception of the question.
Tom was obviously used to such problems.
You'll be all right.
It was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I had coffee on the moustache.
He rarely went there.
Tom's healthy.
Let's sing and dance.
After the war, the winners are always right, and the defeated are the guilty.
Tom and Mary's doll gifts.
Translation of jokes is quite difficult, if it can be said to be possible.
This was an aren day.
I'm carrying bad news.
This doesn't help.
Overcoming the weakness.
How many cracks do you make every day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
Don't you have a random key?
Let's be realistic.
Tea with lemon, please.
Tom's got nothing to do with it.
Maybe this will help you.
I hate him as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his whole body was drinking.
Tom's gone.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is hard.
I'm not going with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a little bet.
I'll make sure we finish this project in time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
Music is universal.
You're too tight when you shake.
What if we don't find them?
Don't let me come for you, Tom.
He won the first place at the game.
I just want you to come back to me.
Dan was smoking marijuana with Linda.
Tom often walks before dinner.
She stayed until late last night.
You're upset.
Everybody shut up.
What exactly happened between us?
What's wrong?
He gave up the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How do we find them?
Maybe it's weird.
No one can save himself from death.
It won't help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom was in trouble a lot so far.
Somebody open the door.
Does this belong to you?
We all hated her.
I just want you back here in Boston.
Democracy encourages freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You'll need a map to travel by bus.
We're very happy.
Is that all we need?
He was desperate about his health problems.
Do you know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom's got a pain in his ear.
Dan was hit by the head with a hammer.
Who gave you that idea?
What did Tom do?
You're in the middle of the night.
It's not the right time now.
You don't have any alcohol anymore.
When are you going?
I'd like to buy my couch.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom became famous.
I got this song stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.
I tried to make him come.
What's up, Tom?
Your mother's advice would be superior to your friend.
We have not yet escaped the danger.
Tom's getting mad.
He's been waiting ten minutes.
She was wearing a deer.
Dan's looking for the police now.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him there.
Monday's the first day, Tuesday's the second, and so on.
They're moving fast.
I need to see Tom immediately.
Tom's waiting for you in the conference room.
What was that crack?
My ancestors are from Germany.
Tom cut the tape.
I've done it.
I want to hear Tom's stories.
Tom saw worse.
I'll see you later.
It's easy to make a toast.
The hunter went deep into the forest and never came back.
You're hurting me.
I'll pay for what I need.
I haven't been happy since Tom left.
Breakfast's served.
Tom's a kind man.
Stop yelling, my head hurts.
You won't command me, man.
Did you ask him to leave?
Tom has three uncles.
What a beautiful sight!
Tom has a plan for everything.
Don't worry.
Tom needs to relax.
I'm jealous of Tom.
What else did you expect?
I was hoping you'd be reasonable.
I'll get stronger.
This elephant is loved by young children.
Thank you so much, Tom.
This is hard for her.
Mary put on her shirt.
She has a picture.
It's a lot of swimming.
The flowers come in.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise.
This is very nervous.
We need more U.S. slang of Tatoeba, immediately!
We're sorry.
Maybe Tom's gonna get scared and give up.
Is this place free?
Pay attention to this problem.
Do not thank me yet.
I want some tea.
I wouldn't want to come in.
Nobody wants to sit with you?
It would really be nice to shut up.
Tom said Mary had a bad influence.
Where's your gun?
Tom wants to do it.
It wasn't easy for us.
I was a passenger.
I'll fly from school.
I've often heard him play the music on the trumpet.
Unsatisfied libido is what produces all art and literature.
This is really hard for them.
Tom's a fool.
I think Tom's gonna be here in time.
Hold on to the plan.
If you're hungry, there's food in the fridge.
Tom beat me.
She's complicated.
Check if the plane is off.
Would you like to take part in this event?
There's almost no coffee left in the cane.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written a few books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I want more coffee than tea.
I didn't rush.
The mosquitoes enjoy human society.
I sleep on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you convey a message to Tom?
He flirts so aggressively that women eventually run away from him.
Tom set the curtain on fire, quite by accident.
You talk to Tom?
It's hard to understand self - discipline if you've never felt the need to practice it.
This is gonna hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everyone tonight.
The pressure's rising.
Tom immediately answered Mary’s question
It's weird that you survived.
Tom's been driving that car for three years.
Can peace be used in food?
Tom knows the way.
Tom misjudged Mary.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you call them?
Tom started dreaming.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom's salting his salad.
Tom's the leader.
Save Tom.
You haven't solved the problem, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable talking about them.
We're busy now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They don't have a choice.
No one's gonna find me.
Tom's very upset.
In what situations would he use it?
Can't we start from the beginning?
Unfortunately, you'll have to do this without anyone else's help.
We're all in danger.
Tom won't want it.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom's amazing.
Take Tom's weapon.
Look back.
Tom hasn't been back for three years.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Are you dealing with some kind of sport?
Tom, meet your new stepdaughter.
He's afraid of getting cancer on his lungs.
I'm very cold.
Tom played on the piano for three hours without interrupting.
I got quality.
Did anyone find someone to protect the child?
I'm quiet.
He was chasing the thief.
It was an extraordinary experience.
Tom squeezed his voice.
Does it matter which one of these I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Are you going to help me?
The current government has a lot of problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
I have nothing to say.
It'd be good.
It's coming up fast.
Tom's very upset.
That's what I said.
Tom has a butler.
Dan pulled Linda out safely.
They're my cousins.
It's 11 o'clock.
I'm a homosexual.
Tom, think about it.
We shouldn't have let her go.
The man's wrong.
I can't wait to find out what kind of gift Tom made me.
I've seen him personally.
I love all the kids alike.
I'm not gonna do what you're looking for me.
Tom seems upset.
What do you know?
Whose picture is this?
There's no replacement.
The hypochondriac is developing diseases where they are not.
My sister makes the hair of the freezer two or three times a week.
I slept on the bus.
Water from the rain evaporates when it's hot.
Ask him to wait until I get here.
Her son is a genius.
I lost my handlit.
It looks very well written.
That was the whole point.
Tom must be still at school.
I never say anything, even though it upsets me.
You're below his level.
I'm sick of getting hurt.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
It's possible that Tom hired Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe Tom this.
Tom's a lot of kids.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you going back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You need to hurry to catch the last train.
Please blow up the room.
Tom is still trying to persuade Mary to accept the job.
How many percent of our bodies are water?
I don't speak French as well as you think.
That's very clever.
Please help me wait for Tom.
You're very smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Don't hold on for five minutes.
If time was running out, radioactivity was decreasing.
Should we believe that?
What'd you get so close to?
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I don't need to convince him.
Tom's sitting behind Mary at the French class.
How can you help her?
Tom was baiting him in the trap.
I'll turn them around.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to the chemistry, we have plastic.
What brought you here?
I need new speakers for the computer.
You're a faggot.
What'd you think?
Why are you angry with me?
I can't read without glasses.
I don't mind helping.
Nobody did anything else.
I'm sorry I'm getting into this.
The books are new.
Thank you for inviting us.
Tom wipes out the gardens.
That was rejected.
I'm not asleep anymore.
Tom made himself clear.
They must be worried.
I took it.
That gave me an idea.
The clock fed's broken.
I was wondering about him.
Tom says you like Mary.
Come on, everybody, get me.
This is a good parking place.
I'm going to Boston all the time.
Tom's not very old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
Children need love.
That's his job.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
It's gonna be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe everything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You've got to keep the kid safe.
Did you do that to them?
I'm sure you'll be all right.
This is already a problem.
Tom's a robbery weapon.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm a little sick.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's get some sleep.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always makes me happy.
I hear they pay pretty well.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you buy anything to eat?
Boston is a great city.
Look at me.
How many litres of oil does he collect in the barrel?
Eat slowly.
It's possible there's another world.
We have nothing you want.
It's green.
Tom repented what he told Mary.
Go find him.
He's in the basement.
Tom's bleeding.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'll yell.
I just heard from them.
Tom's conscious.
Tom lost his hair.
Everybody's sitting down.
He gently touched her.
Maybe we should turn around and come back.
I don't like walking.
He looks a little young to get married.
I hate him in school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're just getting started.
His brother is patient with him.
No one could prove anything.
What kind of hobby do you have?
So I'm serious.
No talking during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do that.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Shall I give you a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You need to write a letter of thanks to Tom.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light went out.
Come on!
What if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wants to eat in bed.
Dan walks his little dog.
It had to be done.
I turned the lamp.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
That's pretty close.
We were worried about you.
Experience is not inherited - everyone gets their own.
I want to believe Tom was happy.
This cloth is very stretchy when it's washed.
The truth is a goal, not a destination.
I blame him.
Did you hear about him?
Tom started talking.
I've been running away for an hour.
Tom's still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without bait, it'll be hard for me to catch fish.
Tom was shaking.
I think he's good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces the inhibitions.
Tom needs two help.
I'll tell him to go now.
Tom seems confused.
No one wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
The boars were black and deep as the homeless.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him a little more with the kids.
Everybody's got drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He's a strict critic.
I've been treating myself with this medicine.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten something?
We played basketball in the gym.
Give them a call.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a very good place.
I have a lot to do.
I'm here to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim, because it was cold time.
You don't have to.
I just wanted to clear up the situation.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
I'll call you.
It's not getting to Tom's house this time.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life away from the Himalayas.
Tom's been working.
Please repeat.
You're very dramatic.
Tom's on his way.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She went to school.
They say Maria Antonette was responsible for the French revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's strong.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?
We were trying.
But it's strong!
We're like brothers.
Let me make you something.
You've got too much work to do.
Is that possible, Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
They voted for the mayor of Boston.
The police found fingerprints from shoes at the scene of the crime.
I asked the same thing.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom saves the letter.
Tom would like that.
She's running out of half an inch.
I said we're closed.
The question is who will tell him.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Tom must not be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come, too?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that Sarkam?
Tom's a gardener.
I'm gonna have to try and deal with this myself.
They ran the spaceship.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
Are you sure this isn't made of diamonds?
You let Tom escape.
What's the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls wearing high heels.
Dream you know.
I looked at her.
A great crowd gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
The time in April is constant.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you crazy, people?
I'm hot.
Tom was a boss.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.
I cut the sandwich.
Can I see you later?
Tom's legs were cold.
The boys and the girls are reading.
Tom has two kids.
In short, it's your fault.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Tom despised Mary.
Tom ran away in the barn.
I met your girlfriend.
You're my luck.
Take Tom's advice.
Tom left unfed food on the plate.
Tom's changing the direction.
There's no living man in the school.
The rocket's flying.
We laughed.
Tom was a little nervous.
Tom's only been here for a visit.
Where do we start?
I know you're a spy.
I wish you a happy journey.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was considerate.
Tom tried to keep her busy so that Mary would not ask him to help her.
I eat very rarely meat.
I'll go ask her.
I'm keeping his seat.
Tom couldn't help.
I'll call her later.
The flowers come out fast after you cut them.
I called them yesterday.
I'm wearing a bag of rice.
I can do it for them.
Tom doesn't write well.
I ate late yesterday.
I just don't like it.
Plus, I can fly.
We've been spending our money.
There was hatred between them.
There's nothing to see here.
Does that sound stupid?
You wouldn't want to be late.
I really want to help him.
We're friends with him.
I may admire others, but I have never ventured to be anything but what I am.
Sometimes it's hard to determine whether Tom's happy or not.
This doesn't warm me up.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Did you imagine a wish?
Children are sometimes afraid of the darkness.
Stay away.
I had to stay.
Tom's the only one who doesn't understand French.
Tom asked for Mary's money.
Who bought you this?
Tom's gonna catch you.
My bags are packed.
Tom's following.
Cubby hair.
This is the best restaurant in our area.
There he is, I like him.
He crossed the street.
As long as there's life, there's hope.
I heard them licking.
It's a shame I didn't drive right here.
I have to visit Tom.
What's bothering you?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I'm not wearing provocative clothes.
This is classified.
That's not so much.
That's what you said an hour ago.
I don't want to die.
I'll be damned!
I'd rather walk alone.
How many herbs did you buy?
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Jackson, your son died of overdose.
Nothing can stop us.
It's not available.
What did you get?
I motivated you.
I don't want to fall asleep.
I didn't see where you put your keys out of the car.
Are you sure you don't want to consider another option?
He didn't give them a chance.
He showed up all of a sudden.
I'll do as you command.
It's a long story.
Tom's gonna be great.
Tom was kind to all Mary's friends.
That would be fun.
He's trading with a half-car.
Appreciate the thought.
I'm not leaving.
You know that?
You've done the wrong thing.
Tom's cold.
Emily's a teenager.
They think it's too expensive.
Who was the thief?
He's got a charm.
The question is who decides what to do.
Tom won't catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice on the photos doesn't sound like my natural voice.
I told you this would get tough.
I didn't know if to get angry or laugh.
I'm mad at you.
We were waiting.
Tom got up at seven o'clock.
I've always wanted a dog.
You're quite safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is, will he visit us next month?
The puppets run them with wires.
I don't want to talk about time.
I'm not as fast as you are.
The other girls put her on because of her clothes.
You're going to be confused.
I'm not following you.
Maybe Tom already did what he was supposed to do.
I'll give them another chance.
He just called me.
The failure has been cleared.
How are you these days, Tom?
I can't stand looking at him.
Some people are afraid of spiders.
She doesn't even understand me.
Beekeepers believe that genetically modified plants harm the bee’s health.
Now you can go.
They're slowing down.
Tom's a second year.
If I can understand, then everyone can.
Tourists weren't satisfied.
Tom's got his socks.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?
Tom pellets.
Laws are like a spider - they hunt muscles, but they let the axes and the frightened break through.
You're so proud of the money.
When did Tom go to Boston?
You left your key on the desk, as usual.
He took off his fur jacket down, got up, and gently knocked on the door.
Tom looks so happy.
We don't look at the same subject, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
Something was Tom's.
You love your life, don't you?
Your desserts are tempting, but we're quiet.
We were looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm willing to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait in the gym.
Tom doesn't want tennis.
Did Tom stay long?
He's sending messages to his boyfriend.
Did anyone see Tom?
He avoided the danger.
What did I tell you?
How many times do I have to repeat that.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
Tom seems desperate.
You sound like you're relieved.
Tom's unforgettable.
Kioto is an extremely beautiful city.
This gloves don't turn around.
I think you're right.
It's all very strange.
I'm writing my confession.
"Why did you break my vase?" "Love for pleasure."
We were very close.
I'll be out every day.
Give me your knife.
Nobody's defending my country.
Tom never gave up.
I asked you not to interfere.
We're not expecting a big day tomorrow.
Tom's a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
This is a horrendous thing.
Wait till I'm surprised.
What do you know about cloning?
Where's my wallet?
Now he's watching TV.
What happened here?
Why is Tom crying?
It's a coincidence.
I'm so glad I'm home.
Can we stop?
I guess that's okay.
You can hug me, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never catch my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It happens all the time.
I wish Camoli could have been as happy as you are.
Try this sweater.
The cat sucks his claws into my hand.
"When did you sleep yesterday?" "At four o'clock." "What? What did you do so late?" "I spoke on the phone with the former."
How did you catch them?
No offense!
I was a little busy with someone else.
His heart was broken by unrelenting love.
When's it too much?
What does a man like you see in a woman like me?
You're upsetting me.
His rank is not high enough for that position.
Are you deaf?
I belong here.
You're my friends.
He's a professional chair.
Tom's not as naive as many think.
I hit a box in his jaw.
We have two daughters and one son.
I'm going to a lunch break.
Did that man attack you?
Fill out the form.
There was no one there.
Do you speak English?
Is there a word at all?
You're not a Canadian.
I'm really getting married.
Everyone rejected Tom.
You can't fire him.
Ken's collecting old money.
There's a lot to say.
I hear what you're saying.
We have to face the facts.
There's no harm.
I really want to know what's going on here.
Tom's scaring me.
Tom's sleeping on his back.
I'm here with Tom.
I can call you a cab.
You're not in any danger.
What can I choose from?
We have to put them in bed.
Tom's only dish on meat is a beer.
That's how I got close to Tom.
I don't want to derange them.
Tom was beaten.
We're really good.
She fell asleep while driving and caused a traffic accident.
I brought some bottles of wine.
Do you like Boston?
Tom was very upset.
Why does Tom do that?
I have a job for you.
How does a number of names come to be?
You saved my life.
It was too little.
It looks different.
That's very rare.
You got me a nasty instinct from him.
It's improved.
This world is a valley of tears.
You don't have to be abnormal to work here.
I saw Tom.
Don't even get angry.
Tom put the gun down.
Tom's supposed to be cutting himself.
Get me some coffee.
You're right.
That was a fake trick.
We'll leave the theory to the mathematicians.
Where did this come from?
We're not ready.
Tom was put in jail for espionage.
Can we somehow help him?
I hope you and Tom won't be too disappointed.
These little letters are read only by a wolf.
I don't see the end.
They'll come looking for her.
This tooth is a cutter.
We're here to help.
He's a military officer.
He was very brave.
I'm not keeping my breath.
Don't buy him anything.
I hear grief in your voice.
She's crazy about him.
The thermometer shows 10 degrees.
When did you buy that from me?
Where are the guns?
Did you kiss anyone?
I'll do as you say.
I would do anything to make money.
I recognize you now.
I don't want you to say something you don't think.
I've decorated my room.
This is just crazy!
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see what he's like.
Stay with Tom to make his hat.
Our nest was approaching the little island.
You won't win.
Wait a minute, I'm done with my laundry, I'm going to give it to him.
Tom was a miner.
It's all white.
I wish I had enough power to keep my diet.
The man in question is currently in America.
It's supposed to be his fault.
I'll look at Tom.
I'll be at my desk.
I'm here for the first time.
That pipe sounds very bad to me.
I'm tired of my eyes.
I need to get away from her.
Tom makes 300,000 dollars a year.
Do I really need this?
Do you expect them?
It's a quick favor.
We had to help Tom.
That's all they're talking about.
One boy grabbed my bag while he was passing by the dot.
When was the last time he hit the baby?
I'm a little sick with my muscles.
We have experience.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'm grave.
They'll fire me because I'm too late to work.
I thought it'd be nice to buy you a pair of bets.
Tom, what's he gonna do now?
That's right!
There's always a nice one.
Why don't you go to a doctor?
Ghost, are you there?
There are no smokers here.
Is your freezer still working?
The city restored that old, historic building.
I can't ask him to do that.
He's really proud.
Tom came back covered in mud.
It's not for you.
Tom was wondering if Mary would know what was wrong.
I don't have anything else.
Tom's at the pool with his friends.
Tom wasn't paranoid.
You're very good with kids.
I just threw it in the trash.
We just got out of there.
Tom booked a seat.
I want to use this.
What color was Tom's socks?
Tom burned my cake.
I've never been a juror before.
I've always admired Tom.
I don't want it when they touch me.
Look at the clouds.
He was so angry that his veins were jammed.
Traveling abroad is not considered.
Tom ended up as a winner.
Tom's here right now.
I'm here to apologize.
It won't be enough.
I'm hiding from Tom.
I returned home and told my wife about the work in Boston.
Tom took off and fell asleep.
And the opposite is true.
Tom's very naive.
Tom didn't want to go so early.
I'll explain later.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I'm chewing gum.
The girl playing the piano is my sister.
I'm not sure anymore.
Don't lose hope.
Were you there?
She's wearing shellfish.
There are no missing stones.
Tom's gone to the point.
He's back at six o'clock.
The pain in dogs is proven to be higher than the pain in cats.
Be careful when you climb the stairs.
Were you with anyone?
I'm not a monster.
What did this do?
The butler opened the door.
Tom was wrong.
Get your legs off me.
Don't say that name about me.
Are you gonna throw that?
Tom has a good profession.
They're my stuff.
Tom went for a walk every day.
The same thing happened to my friend.
I don't feel that way about you anymore.
Tom's not stupid.
Tom, change the subject.
We'll deal with this.
It's a very nice feeling.
What's Tom drinking?
I'll read this.
Give me your glasses.
I'm helping them with something.
I know about him.
We have the key.
Tom had a disastrous failure.
Just get back from vacation.
Tell your son to stop bothering my daughter.
The text is too long.
When did you get to Boston?
I'm late for something.
The caverns contain significant amounts of minerals.
Tom left them.
She's avoiding me.
Tom's back at work.
I want you to find them.
Shouldn't we wait for them?
I wouldn't like that.
I hear you're rich.
Most people are more afraid to face a mistake than to make a mistake.
This is a stupid question, but who's stronger, a lion or a tiger?
We'll have company.
We're students.
Tom pulled the rug out of the champagne.
Thank you, girl.
Tom despises your stupidity.
Don't eat live pork.
Tom made a list of places he wants to visit.
From his point of view, I concluded that he was angry with me.
I miss Boston.
The girl brought me red and white roses.
We need to ask them.
I think you know Tom.
They don't make you happy.
It's time to get to work.
Shot three times.
I'll be sorry if I like it.
They're gratis.
Will you come back?
We can talk about it.
My daughter sings in choirs.
No more words to say.

We're the best.
Now go ahead.

Tom's not going to the market.
Give me a few minutes.

Tom's so stupid.
Tom wants to see it.
Tom was just joking in part.
I'll find out who did this.
Tom hates his job.
I can make a call.
Why don't you trust me?
Tom was trying to avoid getting caught.
Have you found her yet?
Tom's alone there.
You've done your job well.
Don't be a faggot.
Freedom of speech is limited in certain countries.
Tom took the hat.
We're looking for them.
I think Tom's right.
Could you recommend a good book for me?
I'll take you home.
Does your stomach hurt?
Is Tom dead?
You're not calling me.
Try to get rid of it.
I think I love you.
I care about all of you.
She's been knocked over.
You're a pig.
You're not reliable.
Tom can be trusted.
It'll be hard to convince them.
Don't be a fool now.
Did anyone see Tom?
I could use a hand with this.
I owe a lot to Tom.
That was an amazing night.
The smells of jasmine and lavender are my favorites.
I just want you to turn around and look at me.
Tom was apparently bored.
She's very personalistic.
The knife had a very sharp top.
Get ready.
Put him down here.
I swear, I wouldn't have caught up with you even to burn and you would have been the last cup of water.
The universe is expanding.
I thought you lost your handcuff.
Now you're in charge.
Not all of them sleep.
Did everyone agree?
These are my prayers.
Aren't you going?
Do you know anyone who could help?
This week is extremely hot.
No one wanted to get out of the table.
Do you think Tom would like this?
Tom's gone too far.
He's a fool.
Maybe you can help them.
The heart of the broken mirror was cut off on the floor.
I can't ask him to do that.
He's eating pork cream.
I have to go help them.
Tom doesn't dare tell Mrs. White the truth.

I'm sorry, but I don't have that right now.
When was the last time you were in an art gallery?
Play that song again.
I like vanilla ice cream so much.
I was just eating.
Step by step, he's going down the stairs.
That's not supposed to happen.
Let me change the subject.
I'll make popcorn.
Tom put a stethoscope on the chest patient.
Should we call him?
My sister got more presents for Christmas than I did.
What's going on with you at work?
What's there in languages that don't taste?
Let's play football.
Tom stopped shouting.
Were there survivors?
I'm still at work.
Tom's warm.
Where's the bathroom?
I guess Tom knows himself.
She gave birth to twins.
My boyfriend's a reporter.
What's Tom afraid of?
Tom would object.
What brand do you use on shampoo?
He's playing cards.
We all love you.
What were they doing?
I think you should go out on your own with this.
As far as I can see, there's nothing on Tom from a medical point of view.
I saw how to play cards with all of them.
Tom seems confidential.
It's a shame!
Is Tom still alive?
Does Tom have a sheep?
I thought you'd live with us.
How am I gonna know how to get back?

Eating can be spicy without getting angry.
Bring her home.

I'll see you when I get there.
That could be true.
I wasn't sure what to do.
Come on, come on, let's not marry Tom.
I know what it is.
When does Tom arrive?
Could you give me the remote control?
I'm gonna make him kick your lawn.
You're helping once.
We cried in duet.
I'll set the table.
I have a lot to say.

There shouldn't be any problems.
It's hard for me to imagine that.
Where's the nearest workshop to repair the degerido?
Where did you go with Tom?

I must have forgotten.
Tom told Mary to go to the party with him.
Tom knows he's almost done it.
We arrested him.
What else could you do?
Please sign here.
I'll check if he's in there.
It'll be a beast.
I don't think I can move.
I'm glad I can be yours.
He's talking a lot.
I'm not very normal.
I thought they found him.
Why don't we order pizza?
The worse, the better.
Is your head full of straw?
Tom doesn't seem to speak French.
The fruit contains seeds.
You're doing fine with this.
I don’t have enough time to do everything I need to do.
The forest is my home.
There's a swelling on his head.
Vampires can't cross the threshold of a certain house without being invited.

Do you hate him so much?
I want the truth.
Why don't we go and collect them?

What's going to happen to us?
My hometown is by the ocean.

How's it going, Tom?
The wind has changed the direction.
Please don't ask her.
I have to take them home.
No one will ever forget you.
Why didn't you call before you got here?
I can't get an asylum answer from Tom.
Come to know this earlier.
Is there something missing?
I didn't do that for him.
She felt quite lonely.
I'm going hunting at free time.
Where did my driver go?
He's got a flaw in him.
The coat is covered in fur.
Tom's ugly.
When did you buy that with Tom?
I've been informed.
He was fast asleep.
I never doubted that.
The pinions are made in bottles.
Tom doesn't experience it that way.
Tom sat on the stairs and talked to a girl named Mary.
I know what you had.
I always eat.
Tom gave Mary John’s message.
Your wishes are my command.
I have an apartment in Boston.
Can I ask you a question?
I want you to go to Boston with Tom.
Someone just called.
Can I show you something?
I'm not a big sailor.
My father got a fire on the white drops last month.
What a sad story!
Try to sleep well.
I don't think I'm gonna live long.
You need to help her.
Take care of him.
Tom wasn't aware that Mary was hoping to kiss her.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I don't have any friends.
Tom's playing in a band and he's very handsome.
Why can't you take it?
Put the gun down.
Tom showed interest.
Let's play a fight.
It was fun yesterday.
Tom might help us if we ask him nicely.
Tom enjoys eating after restaurants.
Tom says he's used to hospital food.
This is my problem.
I don't think he's gay.

Did you admit that?
Tom's a diabetic.
Call it whatever you want.
I'll send Tom to take care of it.
How would you fix it?
This sounds familiar to me.
Would you like to watch TV?
Of course!
They're not happy.
They verbally abused them.
Why were you chasing me?
I was pretty busy.
I couldn't do what you were doing.
Are you always busy?
Tom heard that.
You're below her level.
Wisdom is a curse when it does not help the one who owns it.
What is the origin of the universe?
Whoever calls, tell him I'm out.

The sheep feed on grass.
Tom's gonna give up.
I didn't know you were unhappy here.
Tom gave up his mind to go to Boston.
I didn't find anything wrong.
Tom works effectively.
I need to be alone.
I can take it from them.
I read Tom's story.
Why are you tired?
Tom said he'd leave at 2:30.
I'll take it with him.
It's not about luck.
I think you know the rules.
I'm sincerely sorry for that.
How are we today?
There's your wife.
He's back in six.
Let these people go.
Tom's eye didn't blink.
You're a good son.
I'll get you to talk to Tom.
I almost called them.
The lamb saw her.
I have to turn the phone off.
Time's good.
This was the wrong information.
No one wants to be around him.
Dan was seen talking to an unknown man near the restaurant.
Tom with ease did it.
I know you're tired.
Why didn't you graduate?
There's a candle in front of my house.
He's the owner of the firm.
Peace at home, peace in the world.
They hate each other.
I'm very busy preparing for the party.
It won't get any better.
He's already done the job.
You shut my ears.
We're not worried.
Don't stay too long.
Tom lives in a boat.
Let's be creative.
You look pretty bad.
I don't want to push myself any more.
We went to the same church.
I arrived in Boston in two and a half.
How could Tom know?
She's studying at the deaf school.
You have a habit I don't like.
You sound very safe.
How desperate are you?
I don't know why I took so long.
I don't want to wait.
What's that, to be invisible to him?
The radio's off.
I turned him down, Tom.
You should be proud.
I'm in love and confused.
I keep most of my money at the bank near my office.
Do you remember what happened last year?
You're going with me and a point!
It's not worth much.
I need you to find them.
Everything went well.
Where are my suitcases?
We all know Tom.
Let us do all we can.
I'll pay.
It's possible that Tom won't help us at all.
I'd rather sit down.
Read this.
I arrived here a few minutes before you.
I'm helping him.
It's an honor.
I'm starting to worry.
Tom and Mary work in the same office.
Envy is a sin.
All the kids are strangers.
They shot me.
Tom's not tending to drama.
I've completed twenty-five projects in just one month.
Tom couldn't decide not to look through the key.
Tea smells good.
Well, I lied.
Do you believe them?
That column isn't exactly vertical.
Let's see what happens if we let Tom do what he wants.
I'm very good with animals.
Did anyone tell you that?
Why are you calling?
They spoke quietly.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him to speak French.
We have to get back.
I think so.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Tom's got a little dick.
Tom believes everything Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going anywhere.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's as tall as she is.
They've been chasing them.
I didn't believe him.
Now you can't help us.
Do you know how much that costs?
I was thinking of visiting the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
You were chased.
Let's go down the street.
There was no living soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I'm not digging you wells.
I've got a few more minutes left.
Wait a minute.
Tom loves you so much.
You're doing great cooking.
There's no shorter way to the top, just to the break-in.
Tom's pretty weak.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom's paid a lot.
It was sad.
You seem to care about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked everyone.
Automobiles are now being distributed.
I can't make such a decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me that time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's wearing chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to give up on yourself.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I had Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my dinner?
The organ was an older man.
I was playing tennis.
I think you can help me.
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do as I showed you?
I'm making kegs.
I want the blue color.
The girl released the bird.
I didn't tell you to take the bribe.
Don't make my coffee.
Tom gave her a beautiful daughter - in - law.
I think we should help him.
If there's no pornography with that, it'll be done.
I've been calling for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play an ass?
They chose her pretty.
What does all this mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you mine, I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was my duty to spend the night with a smart, spiritual and beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and got rid of parental control.
Tom's a wreck.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was held in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you'd write me a message on the night of the night, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess.
He's dressed up to get his hat on.
The river of mud began to lick my face.
Mary gave up her moral values and became an atheist.
Let's just throw that away.
I'm learning math.
The keyboards are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How were you?
The movies are a great occasion.
At first, I didn't see anything.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love the jazz.
They're staring at you.
I would do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests do we expect tonight?
He's in the hospital.
Looks like I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everyone laughed.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
They canceled our flight because of the unfavourable weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat patient.
Singers use microphones to make their voices loud.
They may come back.
I'm so scared!
The whole board is against it.
The world lights up the sun.
His argument was logical.
Come here now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly right.
I'll go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom made himself a tree.
Oh, well, that's great.
Avoid bad associations.
The airport's nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
The carpet's not coming out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to take care of Mary.
Mary wants a hot coffee and Tom's milk.
I gave the wrong address.
I'm done.
I'm not fighting anymore.
The chances are Jane's coming.
I hate it.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl's got a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I don't care what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom's squeezing.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What's my lawyer gonna do?
The nuns sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'll really try to be kind to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where does Tom buy?
It looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can anyone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
It's quiet again.
That's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Get out of here.
I have a lot of problems right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help.
Tom has a problem with anger.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a new man.
Get me a drink.
I think I'm real.
The question is whether or not it can.
Tom ran upstairs.
Tom's gonna kill me when he finds out what I did.
He's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You should do this to work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you were only dating girls who were inferior to you.
I have to pull my belt.
Tom was about to get into a fight with Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some hamburgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This isn't a place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He's been building a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I'm sleeping standing.
I am always weak.
The cake looks nice.
Did someone break your heart?
That's how I feel.
What's wrong with you?
We want to see Tom.
Where'd Tom go?
Who won the prize?
Please, come in time.
The Germans have a weak attitude toward the nude.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny it.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they put his body in a big tomb.
Women want men with scarfs.
He forgot his wallet again.
Do you accept a tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do that, then who?
I wish I could have been like Tom.
I suddenly heard a loud noise.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I wasn't lucky.
His body was raised with brown hair.
Tom didn't want Mary crying.
I'm so pissed off, Tom.
The week is seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure you like Tom.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The inhabitants of the island are friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I've always wanted secret characters.
Throw my ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's the hole with the hat?
Tom is one of the most famous American songwriters.
It can't be a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't worry, Tom.
Tom wants to never come back here again.
No one likes to cry.
She was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb the remote mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do it if I could.
Tom's pretty fucked up.
Try to explain that to Tom.
We're the first to arrive.
I already gave her your number.
My soap burned my eyes.
I'm glad to see you all again.
Tom liked Mary so much.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'll be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This isn't the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're learning fast.
We ate very good food.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I got kicked.
No one's gonna hurt you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had that.
Look out the window.
Mary bought smelly trash bags.
I'm suffering from asthma.
He used to work in the garden in two hours a day.
Tom rarely leaves.
Tom caught malaria while traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where he hid Tom's diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport's out.
You deserve a medal.
They're strong.
How did you make that mistake?
It's good to remember.
Can she do whatever she wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really hot.
We bring them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I planned to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't know French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom is still not quite aware of what happened.
The cocaine is drugs.
This is a little difficult.
Apparently you already know the answer.
Could you not take it?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns the ship?
Yeah, and?
I asked where Tom was.
It was of great benefit to us.
What do you usually do in free time?
I'll come and save you.
I've got a rock in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We fucked up.
Who made the doll?
I didn't lose hope for a moment.
Her long hair was Costen-to-Cafe.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please give him a chance.
I never ask for my hands.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't get in my room.
That's when we started.
I didn't want to thank you.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go in the mail with him.
What's his purpose?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I've got a few doughnuts.
I teach French.
I don't see you.
It was too late.
I live on the lowest floor.
Girls won't play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was thoughtless.
Mary broke up our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to make them stop.
I enjoyed Tom's sensitivity.
We need to call Tom.
They'll hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went to walk in the woods.
Let's just leave him a little alone.
I never wear clothes.
The Greal is broken.
He's gone.
His clients make mostly poor people.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why is that bothering you?
Tom says he wants to do it, too.
Women want men with scarfs.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I don't care about them.
People die all the time.
He's too perfect for him.
Can you make it stop?
Call if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
He took out his sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom didn't like to go.
Tom seems a little depressed this morning.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom's got his brains clogged.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss that with you.
Did he ask for their money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works at the bank.
Death, whatever form it is, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Add the potato.
We're old friends.
Tom pulled out his hat and was politely presenting himself.
That's one reason.
Give me my book back.
Marco thinks he's writing.
Tom looked.
My ears are ringing.
I use the opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very well.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such an asshole!
Who's making him a breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complicated.
Tom didn't want to kneel.
Tom was suspended.
They were laughing.
She'll be a teacher.
I don't mean to tell Tom that.
I'd like a marine fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom looks broken.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Did you become an angel?
That is all we know about them.
Do you think that's what prevented us from doing that?
Maybe we'll find help in the nearest village.
We hope he's okay.
You're capable, but you're out of your mind.
He's been working in the embassy three months ago.
Now we're on the loose.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom became violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this alone.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's mad.
It's from work.
We're gonna make it.
Commendation motivates students to work harder.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom locked the door out of the car.
I don't agree with that.
Stop spending my money.
Tom's about thirty years old.
What's the matter?
I see how upset you are.
Okay, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two.
Tom measured his weight.
I'm sure something happened to Tom.
Tom's had a lot of change since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom seems a little shaken.
He's fucked.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title “lady ” was used only for noblemen.
Tom's been learning French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Is that what you believe?
How to choose a man only one?
I came here to feed Tom's fish.
I'm actually here to help you.
I don't feel it.
My uncle was there, rubbed on the bloody bed, with a stick stuck deep in his heart.
Someone is trying to kill us.
I'm paid to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be safer.
How long will you stay with us?
You must be very proud.
You used to be so fun.
Could you stay a little longer?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking it out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I'm listening to your childhood laugh.
Tom suspected that Mary and I were cooking something.
Just leave us alone.
Tom's pretty thin.
Tom usually wins in a fight.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the sound of the thunders?
Don't interfere with work and pleasure.
I'm working in Boston now.
You put a crown on the king's head.
Tom kept his breath.
Tom was busy at work.
I'll meet you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent's been unlocked.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got off the couch.
Don't make Tom mad.
I turned the fan on, and I turned it on the wall.
This is a home jam.
Tom asked for Mary’s help.
No examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's corpse in a brick grave behind the mud.
Tom writes very well.
That's not quite true.
The rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you some water.
Let her be like a dog.
I'm tired of Boston.
Tom had a strong headache.
When he grew up, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked in.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank lent her a million dollars to the company.
I still have a lot to tell you.
I always write myself down.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what matters to you, and I will do my best to destroy it.
Play more relaxed.
My son always interrupts me while I'm talking.
This is Tom calling.
I'll drive myself.
It looks like I drank too much yesterday, and I'm really upset.
Tom was having a good time.
Tom said he didn't know the guy's name.
I'll get to your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom shut the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have to borrow me an interesting book?
Tom was being cautious.
Just get in there.
He wanted a sword from the steel.
I moved to a new house last week, and yesterday I studied the library.
I told myself.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose off.
When will I see you?
I promise I won't do anything to harm you.
Tom's a unit.
The woman calls the man.
Tom really found something interesting.
Nev had a lot more of them than we did.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't believe you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm so scared.
Dan's getting mad.
I don't even know what it is.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't stand it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their purpose?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are next.
This is the pool Tom learned to swim.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to wait for me in front of the mail.
Which college did you learn?
It's about integrity.
Please don't let go of my hand.
I'd better call him again.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
It seemed much more than I expected.
Clear your eyes.
Tom just got inside.
He's got blood in my eye now.
There she was visited by Mary yesterday.
He's overstepping it!
There's a son who's gone.
I'm trying to work.
What kind of taste do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a feeling the show's going to give up; they didn't sell a lot of cards.
Tom's coming.
Tom thinks he shouldn't use deodorance.
Is Tom often swimming?
The girl's asleep.
Go write home.
Don't force the kid to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're laughing.
Tom paid me.
I'm sick of reading books.
They killed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom's looking jammed.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We always have to support our children.
Everyone has their own sleeves.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what he was planning to make Mary for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I've got the impression it's raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom look upset?
They'll probably come with a car.
Thank you.
You already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had a suitcase less than I did, they complained she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where does he live in any part of Eastern Europe?
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for a moment.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the lights on.
There's too much acid in the orange.
Tom came to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hooker named Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he'd take the bunny down.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're so lonely.
Please don't add any comments.
That was Tom's only flaw.
Do you remember what you were wearing when I met you?
Mollus are usually accompanied by thunderstorms.
Tom likes tea with a tomato.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom seems nervous.
I have a little temperature.
Tom stabbed him to the ground.
There's no end to this lecture!
The glasses are in the glass credit card.
Give us some time.
Tom was wondering why Mary didn't want to have sex with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time to change.
You should wear a helmet while you drive a motor.
We're worried about him.
Tom's British.
John and Eve are best friends.
I'm as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the shrink.
How do you not yet sleep that way?
Everyone knows I hate her.
He's unable to do that.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They were loving.
I burned the waste.
We both saw him.
That would be uncultural.
Tell us where they are.
Tom's a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in the tropical regions.
I think I've made myself quite clear.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this great?
Tom said Mary's down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Do you think about them?
Actually, I'm back with the ex-boyfriend.
Just do this thing.
I think Tom's beautiful.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he could play tennis, but he doesn't.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign say on the door?
Sit down.
I was thinking about your problem with Tom.
The hair and how it keeps its head reminds me of Maria.
Don't block my way.
We're looking for them now.
I got my shoes on.
Tom would've come back.
She always works worth it.
What state are you a citizen?
An elephant bone trade is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'll meet Tom.
I like dogs more than cats.
There's still a little space in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary's been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still doesn't know how to swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you cared a lot about Tom.
I was home.
I should've asked her first.
Tom's the father.
You know what I need.
It's not going to take this fever.
It looks like these two have calmed down.
Unfortunately, I can't let that happen.
I need you urgently.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't have any broken money.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You were brave, weren't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't mean to.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Go on with your work.
When are you closing up?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a lonely man, you can say.
I can't handle this job.
Looks like we're gonna have to try harder.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to the party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you looking for mother in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree floats.
We'll keep in touch.
We're almost together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary call John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom's never been sitting for a long time.
Go with the sticks.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everyone spoke.
How proud I am of you.
Tom was looking for the drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa have died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'll hurt you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
That's right.
Then the forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was oppressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought there were bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to leave soon.
Tom doesn't know how to feel.
There's a little more tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
I was nervous.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was everything just a dream?
I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," the blind said.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom turned into a pop.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he lived here before.
Why is Tom like that?
I have problems with the sinuses.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom's out of water.
The Esperanto doesn't belong to anyone.
She's the witch with the chicken.
Turn it off.
I don't share my real name on any website.
They threw the plan away.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I've got three cadres.
Turn the alarm off.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been a week, up and down.
He's slowly recovering from the disease.
I want a tournipe.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom seemed really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Get away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly is on the roof.
Her face was bled with sperm.
Tom's just.
This is what you need to do first.
We met around noon.
I'm not doing anything tonight.
Get him a drink.
Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is that moral?
You know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm so confused.
They were waiting outside.
That's why he was ordered to leave the firm.
I'd understand any of you.
Tom's trying to be a teacher.
I wish you a nice week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are there in the house?
Tom should go now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why are you blaming them?
Get over yourself.
We're being childish.
Tom was a boss.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom's getting up.
Let's go outside and talk.
I don't know what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
Sheika's got the tire down.
We made ourselves a tree.
This is much better.
I'm gonna make her kick your lawn.
Tom's doing it for math.
Tom pulled his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with the kids every week.
Tom was always stubborn.
You're cooking bread in your ovens.
You're crazy.
Your sons are pretty handsome.
I know how much that's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We ate lobster and cheese.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite her illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They knocked on the door.
Tom came to stay with us a few days last spring.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the other night.
That's so terrible.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them an apple.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I don't have any use for that.
It's not worth it yet.
Cite me an example.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.
Was he honest?
The fiddle was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't let it go.
They're close.
Mom and Dad won't come with me.
The vampire was brought back to life in the dead chest.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I'm done with my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where should these documents be handed over?
Tom's got a bruise on his eye.
Tom's company is in danger.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates running.
I couldn't call you.
Is it true?
I know you're angry.
When I left this morning, Tom was still on his pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror in the bathroom is clouded.
Tom was painting.
Tom thought Mary would be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can smile at me.
Unfortunately, I don't have enough money for me right now.
"Are you a vegetarian?" "No, and you?"
Molnja hit the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
It's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They raised my salary again.
I'll never even get there again.
I'm filming a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom's got a job to do.
What should we do today?
Do you believe in horoscope?
I know I'm going.
I'm contributing.
It was a real disaster!
Tom's good at his profession.
I thought about it.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name from the list.
Tom put all this in order.
I'm not betraying her.
The flowers attract bees.
The water's milk.
Before long, there was no growing life in this climate.
You're incapacitated.
What was Tom's answer?
You'll do as I command you.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did what I was supposed to do.
Tom's very far away.
Tom wants to write.
Tom's very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, so?
I have a great interest in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not a scientist at that.
She's got tight hips.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom doesn't tell the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and poet travel together.
There's no time to explain.
Are they going to arrest me?
Unfortunately, he's breaking all the rules.
Why aren't you home?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Let's have a beer.
Mr. Kimura is waiting for you on the line.
Men and women are people of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound was released by a gentleman.
No, and it's not even under the chair.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't hold on.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must be feeling lonely.
What did you ask for on the Internet?
I think it would be a mistake to borrow Tom's money.
Our solar system is constantly moving.
I couldn't find her.
Tom threw Mary's papers on the desk.
Tom did this.
I'm learning art history.
I don't really agree.
What's on the agenda?
There's a lot more.
Looks like these two are back together.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're strangers.
Moral choice is for the translator whether to translate something or not. Certain things are better left in the language he has produced.
You're mean.
Tom's avoiding Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you need to ask Tom for permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask for his help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Take a look.
Give me the French key.
Tom seems distracted.
It was an ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom got the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom's courtesy.
Tom has no hope.
Tom's wearing glasses.
I'll keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because the orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun is constantly changing.
That's exactly what Tom told me.
Tom looked Mary deep in his eyes and smiled.
It was very narrow in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all right.
The stars shine.
Really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without shaking my knees.
Tom's a white man.
Tom could do better.
I didn't call you for that, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
You'd have found them.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be famous in time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait anymore.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can eat lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're taking off.
We'll go shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom's a nightmare.
I just cut my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would he lie to you?
He has a passive character.
Someone might have followed her.
My wife was here once.
It's a cure right.
We were on the coast.
I don't want you to abuse them.
Depends on your decision.
That's inconvenient.
Tom responded badly.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
Tom was threatening you.
It's not attractive.
A few people understand that.
You're very cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
She was delighted to meet her lawyer.
That's our best chance.
It smells like flowers.
Tom's got a crush on himself.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom's a fire extinguisher, and he started squeezing.
She's a tennis player.
I wasn't in Boston the night they killed Tom.
I need you for a second.
Have fun as much as you can!
Who are these?
Speak for yourself.
It was the result of great difficulties.
She slowly developed a hatred for me.
I don't think it's a good idea.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
So we didn't agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical to me.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't hold on.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I'm wrong.
My computer's stuck.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
And so the conscience really makes us all cowards.
There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of them.
I don't expect anything less than perfection.
I think that hotel would be a little expensive for you.
Tom took the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't have to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You made a mistake.
We're glad to see you.
Now you must leave, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
The screen emits green light.
The English has become my favorite subject.
Things happened fast.
Where's the evidence?
When we woke up this morning, we faced terrible news.
The knee wound is now dusting.
Clear your eyes.
Mary's scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't touch anything.
Tom's an agricultural worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying himself.
Maybe Tom will hear you.
Since when did Tom sleep?
It's our job to help them.
He suffered great losses.
Tom just needs some rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a mantal bomb?
Why would Tom do that to us?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to stay here.
I almost cut myself.
I'll get down here.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
He's got blood in his brain now.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't a man you could easily agree with.
I don't want pork.
She wants to run.
I need a sea turtle.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it'd be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom read the note.
The kids drew pictures on the sidewalk with the credit.
You're wondering what you've kept so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I need to take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I went to Boston twice.
Tom's married at the age of 26.
We've already cleared that.
You want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, and it's not even under the chair.
Tom and I are drinking friends.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's hearing something.
Tom is always trying to act the way he thinks is right.
Apparently, Tom often doesn't understand what's going on.
Come visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She wants to praise the magnificent patterns in the house.
I'm not a resident.
What do you have in the bowl?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's going on right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
Who's your favorite nail polish?
I'm learning piano.
They need the money.
It's a good swim.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You don't get involved in this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I watched TV when Tom came.
You're not following.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's actually very common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you know.
Didn't I do anything to upset Tom?
The triangles don't have four angles.
There's not enough light to read here.
Tom's counting on Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turned the carmine away.
Let me guess.
Tom's ashamed of me.
Guess what you told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I've been looking everywhere.
I'll talk.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everybody's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon is coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
You found your parents.
He gave us a dubious answer.
Wake me up as soon as they break up.
Mr. Gorbachev, break down the wall!
Tom seems intimidating.
Tom's done it.
That's what it's supposed to be.
Let's try and get together.
That'll be hard.
I don't like retirement.
Thank you for asking.
I have good reason not to like Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll investigate that right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are closed.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter was not to be sent at all.
The girl wearing a scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom's gonna fight much.
What are you doing?
I'll call him right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The Prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt that loving.
I can't control her.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's nothing urgent.
I'll get it now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I don't care about all of you.
I'll come by the subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
I'm not very fond of Tom.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom's going to school with a car.
Did you see it?
I'll have to think about this carefully.
I'll buy the calendar.
Everyone's talking about me.
Do you ever think of us?
Are you writing the speeches?
It was a great show.
We should go find them.
Last time I was home Friday night when I was thirteen years old.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off the hat.
I don't know what you think will change.
I'm doing it for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
You just made me do it.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to figure out a plan.
Tom's so angry.
Tom's going to sleep.
To protect our peace!
Tom's well armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said we should stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them so much?
We have to get him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to feed my thirst.
Tom's here in time.
Today's boring TV.
Oh, great!
Tom found a detail with four lists.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom seems really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She quit smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We got to say hello to them.
Didn't you smoke?
All visitors must be questioned.
Where'd you get that scar?
You're nobody and nothing.
We're not gonna find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds quite valid.
It's a law!
The water breaks the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom's here safely.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
Here, I want challenges.
He's not sitting on the bench.
I should have done that yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Watch out for the rumors that they're flying off the fire.
It's just an invention.
Tom kept quiet all night with Mary.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I keep dreaming of you.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I'm laughing.
Let's get a soul together.
I'm sure he'll put on the closer test.
Let's go to Boston.
Tom's a good father.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her in the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three cans of pumpkin spray.
It was awful.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these drugs for my dad.
The kids love cake.
He's been held up a lot.
I can go out with Tom.
Tom's getting upset.
This is from us.
In an emergency, what number do I call?
I still want a horse.
I didn't even touch it.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary collected all the money for Tom.
Enough with the crap.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always loved his son.
Tom has a big mouth.
It's like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom started beating.
Butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom got out of work earlier.
We have everything.
I burned his cookies.
When's the school year over?
You're right from the beginning.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say "Bye"?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be fakes.
Beauty cannot be determined objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom's inconspicuous.
His girlfriend's weakened.
Between me and Tom, it's done.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
He left me in despair.
Tom screaming woke up from the nightmare.
Tom's got a weak look.
The guy didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
Is it over?
Everyone wants lasting peace.
We met a day ago.
Where's his stuff on Tom?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom put his eyes away.
The tide wasn't so happy that a peacemaker was coming.
Open up.
Put your vest on.
It's possible you're wrong.
I burned the cake at the same time.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still in school?
It was an honor.
I talked to my counselors about what subjects to take.
I already wrote everything I needed to write.
Look, you don't care about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
Now there's nobody in the classroom.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's point.
Is Dan aware of what he did?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom doesn't have any friends.
Who lives in the room under this?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice man.
I never change my sleep schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen him?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst thing that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll transport you.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
Mary whispers something to Tom in her ear.
Tom knows he's very vindictive.
I've seen it go.
We're gonna miss Tom a lot.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do anything like that before.
You're very stubborn.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Tatoba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Did you ask Google for me?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just showering.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's on his own again.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We're manikin'.
What do you want?
Tom found a new job.
Tom's not coming back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
That responsibility for him is a burden.
Tom's still playing golf, right?
I'm having lunch today.
My pop music is my favorite kind of music.
Half an hour has passed.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was exciting.
I don't see anything.
He's a pretty unpleasant man!
They blew up their beach tent.
I didn't want that at all.
You better be alone.
I have to warn him, Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and put another one in that place.
Stop!
Do you want cheese?
I'll call you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
The roofs aren't clear at all.
That was very rude of Tom.
It's double.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I'm angry.
Let's get you out of here.
Sequencing is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay well.
Tom's probably out.
We didn't fight.
Tom looked inside.
At the same time, you are heavy and easy, and pleasant and bitter; I can't live with or without you.
Let's say you're right now.
Tom's doing great.
I don't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's hot here.
That disappoints him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
How could I have understood?
Tom's a pain in the ass.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
You didn't praise us.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget it.
We have to find them first.
I'll take care of it.
Tom hit Mary on the head with the roof.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We both better get some sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very fussy.
You need to help them.
Tom didn't even cry.
He wrote a book, and that's great.
Tom turned the quack.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I'm looking at ghosts.
I was tired and cold.
Nothing is more sad than stupidity and indifference.
They're all messing with each other.
Tom didn't protest.
What are the web sites from?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What's in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're sympathetic.
I hate ducks.
I didn't say I did that.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I spent the whole day cleaning snow.
His paralysis is getting worse and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to run?
I need Tom.
The changes are never easy.
Is he far away from Boston?
I'm paid to help you.
This jacket's too small for me.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could prepare it by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston on a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very effective.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with that later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train while he was at work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the carpet out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
There's a guard coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that was attached to the locker.
The gulabies symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
Traitor!
I will do everything for the good of mankind.
Did you really stay home all night?
Annie's music is beautiful.
Is she a cab driver?
I'm sure I'm losing my hearing.
Now it's over.
I'm sleeping.
There is no scientific evidence that there is a connection between the character and the blood group.
She sounded angry.
Honestly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who doesn't agree?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom's brave.
Avoid smoking too much.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pushed the button to turn the radio on.
We're playing on a computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a product for men.
We've been looking everywhere.
I love your website very much.
I'll get you.
Push this button.
Tom really can fight.
What's bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom broke his car.
You've got to get through the trouble.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All gooseberries carry eggs.
We'll take something.
I think Tom's cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I'm looking at how things are going.
I'm making very stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Wait a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where did Tom go?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, get out of here.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for more money.
Tom wants adventures.
They don't have a hat.
A lot of trees collapsed.
Lions don't make any difference in colors.
That wasn't true.
The answer's fucked up.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look over here.
I want you to get my money back right away.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a really good time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try and do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Just a few passengers survived the accident.
I can imagine you're married to Tom.
Tom seems polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm lower than you.
I'll quote you a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed he didn't have his wallet.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do cows survive?
I'm running out of my right ear.
Cartoon boxes are broken.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
These don't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
I'm putting the calendar on the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you.
We packed their bags.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
They don't even throw a curse.
Did you get Tom's invitation?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny it.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What is the text about?
Tom wrote a letter to Mary and thanked her for her help.
I decided to go.
They eat sandwiches.
The bees have been living for a long time.
Tom's a strong man.
Tom's sleeping very hard.
Are you helping him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, it's my turn.
Did you come here with a car?
I don't know the end of the story.
We're done.
I'm sure.
Will you wait a minute?
You're among friends.
You're something I'm weak.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call me?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start again.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for receiving me.
Susan's actually your half sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I like the eggs from the underpants.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
It's love for crazy people.
Why would you help him?
Tom's got his shoes on.
We've lost faith in humanity.
Tom's dealing with the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how am I to blame for that?
Why do all of us hate us?
Tom, lend me some money.
Am I interrupting you?
End violence; fight for peace.
Look how I do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.
Most plants died.
Hold on, Tom.
You're very useful.
Tom is still unable to talk to us.
They're gonna be very happy about it.
I'm gay.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom wants cheese.
Can I honor you for dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should take a look.
Get down, Dick, it's dinner time.
I'm on my way.
He was driving fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's getting into the boss's office.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come on in.
Is anyone sitting here?
I have to cut my expenses this month.
Nobody's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Did you pay already?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom put his face out.
What benefit do I have from you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
He burns me when he wears that suit.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live on the floor under this.
They believed it.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't get married.
I tried to explain, but I don't.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
The dolphins are a species of mammals.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom may be alive.
Will the future be like scientific fiction?
Tom laughs at you.
I think I'm going to eat outside.
Open the door, even though I told him not to open it.
It narrows the choice.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by idiots.
Tom asked us to look after his kid.
I drew the word "Alis" to highlight it.
Third luck.
We need to get out of here.
This is a breathable testo is popular in the Philippines.
Nobody said anything.
Let us strive for the good and to give up the vices.
You're smart.
I'm against the projects.
Wasn't he tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom was listening to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I got here too late.
I could have known Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There's some writing reports.
It hurts here.
You're distracting Tom.
Where did we go?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just take care of it.
I was just messing with you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to sleep now and finish tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Illnesses often come up at the worst of times.
The dog stares at me like he wants to eat me.
They were animals dressed in human skin, and they were not real people at all.
The man's starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
All is in progress, but beautiful memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What did Tom think?
It was really nice.
They're all dying then.
I know how to stay calm.
We love the beauty.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I suggest we focus on the request to get out of this cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda another check.
That's right, people!
This is a beautiful building.
Tom wasn't disappointed.
Do you know how to write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats bring bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I love it so much!
Is this exactly English?
Let's follow him.
Tom gave Mary a towel.
She's got ears like edra.
Give her a table.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't really know how to answer the question.
This is a ginger drink.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only eighteen years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom was wondering what Mary would say.
I don't like how that sounds.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I don't understand.
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for Tom.
I guess you've read my report.
Tom's back.
Don't repeat yourself.
The blacks are red.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look very good.
You let Tom down.
Stop it.
Tom looked like he was a mess.
What else can Tom do?
I want to become physically and mentally stronger.
She's a very happy girl.
If I could stay, I'd stay.
Please, stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded upset.
They started going.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Remember you didn't fall.
"I got a nine on the chemistry test.
He was lucky to have survived the attack.
I guess Tom wasn't in a hurry.
Tom was visible.
How was the dance?
I'm a student.
It's just me.
I don't understand why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'll take Tom for a walk.
I don't like it when I'm alone.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always leave your point dirty.
He moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have a professional experience?
I didn't ask you.
Let's have lunch.
I guess I was a fool to expect you to do something.
You're my pride and joy.
What would you say?
Make two lines.
Titles should attract readers ’ attention.
He was sitting in front of me.
I'd rather die than surrender.
I'm actually working here.
Tom suffers.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like the way you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
That worked.
I was watching a French movie with an English translation.
Tom was laughing at Mary.
Tom's back in confidence.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says the child's diseases are fake.
Dan had a tough relationship with Linda.
Everyone's back.
Do you have a violin?
Give us a call.
Maybe Tom could sing at our wedding.
What would Tom choose?
The hospital isn't big there.
Most people have to work to support themselves.
Nothing ever changes.
Mary's pregnant.
We'll stay.
I'm not yelling their dog.
I didn't sleep properly.
I want freedom, I don't want it, and I can't serve a political party.
Girls enter puberty from 10 to 11 years of age, and boys from 11 to 12 years of age.
It's gone.
Tell Tom he can't forget to restore his passport.
The sky will be dissolved soon.
I'm going cold on a touch.
He thought someone put his poison in his soup.
A lot of people do this.
I still can't tell you.
Mary decided to buy a son's dress.
She was touched.
Epten was cheap.
Marriage scares some people.
Was the door closed?
I've got a big eagle.
Why can't you come?
The people rebelled against the ruler.
Let's talk to Tom.
He wants strange animals, such as snakes.
We need leaders.
It's his first day at school.
Don't get dressed when you get home.
Tom taught me to sing.
"What book are you reading?" "Roman."
You're burning the car.
That gun is not a toy, boy!
Half of the species are women.
They're staring at him.
That's for them.
That's Tom's dog.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to go again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.
I want to do social work to make amends for all I have done.
Tom's on the tops.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I don't have any complaints.
I still don't understand women.
Is Tom aware?
Tom's beautiful.
This sentence can be interpreted in a number of ways, which I should have taken into account when translating.
He's a werewolf.
I knew you'd like that restaurant.
Are the axes poisoned?
Kidnapped their eyes.
You're lying, Tom.
Who stole my keys?
Dan invited Linda to a student's party.
Mary's giving a lot of support.
Tom's in danger now.
I'm giving you a word.
Who's gonna pay the rent?
You're a little rude.
Hey, put that back in place.
I wanted Tom to come.
Does Tom like Mary?
I've been waiting for you outside.
I want my money back.
Tom doesn't care.
Tom wanted Mary to take John to the library.
Let's find out who stabbed Tom.
Tom knows the bottomton.
You saw what I could do.
We have a lot of money.
Does your appearance fit your age?
Can I?
Not all honey and milk in Canada.
I have information on this.
Tom got tired.
Do you understand the difference between what is right and what is wrong?
They're not stupid.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
He's weak in vision.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I've prepared a speech.
The juices have a sharp look.
I wrote that to them.
I lived in Boston last year.
Tom was squeezing.
We want a new carpet.
Let's share a cab.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom laughed politely.
The teapot's pretty dirty.
You should sleep well.
Tom's got the trigger.
They went for a walk.
This is his grandfather from his mother's side.
I want specific information.
Friendships are magical.
The volcano has become active again.
Tom told me he should take care of some things.
How will that help?
Dan probably killed Linda by suffocating her.
The little island from far looks like a rabbit.
Are the feeders in danger?
What did Tom ask?
Stop messing around.
I'm thirty years old.
His acting in no way is perfect.
They're definitely them.
Don't wait.
You don't know how long you've been here.
The dog was barking him.
Let's go to a movie.
Beautiful women are much older than beautiful women.
Tom has sheep.
He's asleep.
Mary feels her face warmed up.
I know what makes Tom so happy.
I thought Tom was retired.
Tom missed it.
Please, come with me.
I can't go anywhere.
Stop following them.
Tom's a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
I don't mind.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom's got no need to lift his jeep.
You deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not taking the tuxedo.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She's been working for nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the real words?
I'm terribly hurt here.
I hate this carpet.
I'm a little sick.
Tom stopped it.
Tom couldn't remember where he left the umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'll get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That thing's over.
It's unnatural.
What did you steal?
Tom will never finish the job he started.
Tom's a gentleman.
Do you have any pets?
You weren't right about the picture.
I'll get it.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be kind to each other.
Tom's a substitute.
I think I'd better help him.
But you're smart.
Tom said you'd like my help.
You all look so busy.
I was sure we could trust Tom.
They're all messing with him.
Faith makes you hope for what your mind cannot hope for.
Tom was with me.
Tom was wondering why Mary didn't want to help him.
You've ruined your whole life.
I couldn't imagine this world without music.
I live nearby.
There's a button on the inside of the door.
Both books are equivalent to value.
We rented a movie.
Death is coming back.
Tom filled the trunk to the top.
Pick your weapon.
They've chosen a new government.
"I'll change the gardens." "All right, I'll erase them."
I'd buy it.
He's the one who's pulling himself in the back.
We appreciate our customers.
We have to respect the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom's wet.
They asked to raise their salary.
I stopped paying Tom's attention.
Did you know Tom was gonna be here?
The earthquake caused the fire.
Tom's not here today.
If I hadn't eaten, I'd really like to have lunch with you.
What do you need, Tom?
He'd say something.
Greal's stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he'd never see Mary again.
Drop the weapon and take it.
And see you tomorrow?
I'm the one you want.
We bought them those books.
That's totally possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
It's working like a subtitling.
That was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The fan's not working.
It's not my fault.
I could do nothing.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
Got it?
My day was full of activities.
Is this yours, Tom?
My dad's sick of flu.
I haven't waited long.
Just look at you.
This is great.
It's not empty in front of the two points.
Tom lives on this street.
You should go to the dentist.
The soldiers shot.
Tom can't stand it.
The store's closed.
They listened.
Tom came out.
This is all I can do.
He adheres to his principles.
Tom's upset.
I'm just here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
I still remember the first time I saw you.
They unplugged him.
Tom's a big cicada.
Can I put this here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll take you home.
Tom died of cancer.
What do you think happened?
Tom doesn't believe this at all.
I asked myself about them.
I'm asleep.
I'm planning on going to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
He's snoring like an apple.
You should pay your rent in advance.
Put all the garbage in the storm.
I'd love to ride with Tom.
It's time for that again.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
"Will you think?" "Yes."
I don't own the guitar.
I teach Chinese.
Tom was sitting on the desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
Don't talk so fast.
You go get Tom and get back.
I don't see a conspiracy here.
I'll give you the little money I have.
Tom wants me to have his birthday party next Monday night.
Get the mask out.
That's a no-one option.
You can go anywhere.
I'm bluffing.
I liked the way you dance.
I need you a little bit.
We were beaten.
Tom's the right one.
Tom seems scared.
The police will investigate the case.
Now you've planted it.
It's white.
Sit down.
Iron is stronger than gold.
I was wondering if you could help me tomorrow afternoon.
Tom became violent.
When does the show start?
Can I just talk to you?
We won't let you die.
Condours are jealous of me.
Tom didn't say anything about it.
It's probably true.
We had to go home walking in the rain.
I like it when I'm alone.
Tom's got a lot of money, but he's got no friends.
Each color has its own meaning.
The old house was in bad shape.
I just don't feel safe about it.
I've lost my breath.
Can you get those?
My dog really likes oranges.
Your police are full of books.
Tom wasn't sleeping well.
I blew it.
You're making me sick.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in town.
Let's go wake Tom up.
How am I gonna find him?
The ice is hot.
I spilled blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm afraid of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get early.
I'm sure it's very easy for you.
I've never been caught.
I love my fatherhood.
I haven't learned how to write.
They stopped.
Tom can handle it.
Don't freak me out.
Tom's comfortable.
Tom didn't answer my question.
The room was locked.
I can't justify it.
Tom was stealing from me.
Victory is bitter.
They're looking in the mirror.
I don't own to cry.
Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Tom sent Marie to the door.
It looks very delicious.
I need to understand.
You two have come against me!
I've never had a sleeper in my life.
Don't sleep in the tub.
Tom tried everything.
Do you have a cigarette?
The kids sleep upstairs.
I'm studying music.
I didn't get so bad.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm pretty proud of that.
Look, you don't mind.
We live by the sea.
Soldiers wore steel helmets.
I'll send Tom home.
What are you talking about, guys?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed that Mary caught the fish.
It's boring sitting at home.
It's not that bad.
They're freaking out.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
Probably won't be worth waiting for.
I have to buy a new queue for the room.
Tell Tom to write.
You want to go to work?
I couldn't bear it.
It's sunny today, but it's cold.
What's this about?
I'm not an expert.
My greatest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom ran down.
Tom gave the word.
Tom and Mary left us the first day.
Let's have a fight.
The girls run and play.
I'm not sure Tom just did this.
"Don't you eat Spanish?" "I'll eat it later."
This is my favorite object.
Tom's got the trigger.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find you, Tom.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are of real skin and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom sang.
Tom's not that tall.
She's wearing a leather belt on the rope.
They fired the fire.
They finally left.
Tom was married to Mary.
I'll go find them.
Tom came here even though it was raining.
I don't want to use a dildo. I prefer real whores.
I'm not cooking him.
Why are you calling her?
You really need a shrink.
Tom gave a speech.
We're playing Sunday.
Tom surrounded him.
You can only stay if you're quiet.
I want to know what happens next!
I can't believe Tom just did it.
Tom kicked me out.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Haven't I told you yet?
Don't fight.
I expect help from you.
Tom himself will go.
Tom only had Fridays at school.
Tom agreed with me.
I'm sure your intentions are clean.
Tom was talking too much.
My brother's out.
It was great.
I'd like to be able to tell people my real name.
The fence built a temporary loop.
Tom was actually laughing.
Tom's allergic to pollen.
They contacted local politicians.
Tom gets notes.
They gave me this card.
We'll discuss the forecast.
Everyone has their own style.
That doesn't prove anything.
Can I eat this apple?
How long has it been since Tom died?
Tom's weird.
That was very nice.
My dad gives me a $10 pocket a week.
I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe.
How long did you work for them?
I need to help Tom.
Maybe Tom knows French.
Tom's squeezing me.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you pour the wine, it's appropriate to wipe it with a lactate, isn't it?
Men have about seven or eight times more testosterone than women.
What games do you want to play?
Tom wants to know when you can come to us to help us move the keyboard.
Tom used to be shy.
It's cool.
I couldn't sleep all night.
Trust me.
I'm looking for you.
Do you want robots?
He's losing his mind.
He's really burning me.
I can go wherever I want.
Tom was often harassed at school.
When does it start?
The bear bites on its own.
Tom passed the field.
I put three coffees of fake sugar in your tea.
I like her dark eyes.
Is it time to go?
Tom calmed down.
The gloves have a hole in the thumb.
Tom always got what he wanted.
I doubt it.
Tom doesn't do what he needs to do.
Dan was still alive.
The universe is not your friend or enemy.
We did everything we could for her.
You should buy some sugar.
What's he up to for dinner?
What'd you do for a ride?
Take care of Tom.
There's fruit and meat in the market.
When she started talking, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked the other way.
Tom is the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you cut the price a little bit?
I'll change first.
Tom is now thirty years old.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
He became a chuconbabe just a few days before he was nine and a half years old.
Is it everywhere you're looking for?
It's important to have a mind that no one's ever a percent.
He's gesticulating while he's talking.
Sit next to me.
Tom's impressed.
Tom never lends money to anyone.
I'm truly happy for Tom.
Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1633. However, because of his age and poor health, he was allowed to serve that sentence in a domestic prison.
Scientists claim that people who laugh more often live longer than those who ran the truck.
I talk to her a lot.
Please don't ask me about them.
Tom crushed the tree.
The earth is still watered, and the sword is likely to be lifted.
I was caught in a dreary.
What a collection!
They all have names.
Did you ever smoke a dick?
The dog was following me.
That was Tom's last words.
I think Tom's gone.
He's trying to become an actor.
I broke my plastic bottle.
Is this our cabin?
Let's get this done.
We're fine.
I threw my money in the water.
I think that's crazy.
Tom's very rude.
The cloud is expected to sink into the swamp.
I can send her a message.
She's a little red.
Tom's a patient man.
Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions about them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.
Tom stood still.
I'm collecting postmarks.
This time tomorrow we'll be in Boston.
Do you live here?
The room looks like a carriage.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom's fussy stuff.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.
I don't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to go and leave him to find him.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom's the brother of one of the victims.
The powders are soft.
That doesn't matter.
I want comics.
You have a really good manuscript.
The wind keeps blowing.
Meanwhile, the stupid uncle was sitting in the living room.
Did I talk to you?
Messoons fall from the tree.
Do you have a band?
You can wait here.
I got a Friday in French.
I want the class to shut up.
It must be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him last year.
The wind is blowing.
It's a risk plan.
How's it getting from here to the mail?
I don't want to get Tom involved in this.
It's nothing scary.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you need to know this.
Are you going to wear yourself this year?
I'll do whatever you want.
I'm not that warm either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there's an unforgivable act, it's an act to refuse to forgive.
The door's squeaking.
Tom asked for a glass of cold water.
How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he was going?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I'm thirsty for him.
She looks at home.
I'm not even sure I remember exactly.
Tom noticed Mary watching him.
You've been pushing me a lot.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice man.
The eagle is the king of birds.
I'll call you later.
This is an honor.
Why don't you rest?
You don't have to ask why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let's talk.
I think Tom's fine.
The sky's torn apart.
The gala will wake up the baby.
Just look straight.
That's not something for a man to stand by.
Tom and Mary are playing rhyme.
I made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom leaned on Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom, you think you'd prefer a son.
How did you get here?
You left the book.
Don't catch my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'll go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret journal.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We've been talking for up to two hours.
I learned about you from him.
I know you're upset right now.
He's gone.
A long walk called his appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom served himself with a cup of tea and a doughnut.
Tom could tell you.
There's just no way I can make Tom swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do it, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both laughed again.
My wedding must be perfect.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting's already started.
We want to hear it.
I really like the way your hair looks.
Is it cold outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom's in danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
It's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair's broken.
Tom's the tallest guy in the class.
Tom, you grew up fast.
That was our only consolation.
No one would care.
Did you write in the diary today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can you do it on your own?
Is it your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I left prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the key, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into it now.
Why are you blaming me?
Come on, Tom.
I'm just gonna try and get there in time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause disease.
We're ready up and down.
Tom's got a sharp ear.
I bought them.
I told you I can't.
Tom's books are translated into many languages.
I'm not comfortable with him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't take the carpet off.
I helped him break up the table.
I ate a cupcake last night.
It's better for your health to go up the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is bad.
I'm sorry I even told them something.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could find someone else.
Take me to two and a half.
Tom's gone.
I slept in the yard.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That can work.
Aren't you cold with short sleeves?
Tom's the best.
He's got an eye for art.
That was the worst party I've ever had in my life.
I need a cover.
Tom's rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Asian Japanese movies?
Did you get them?
The French language was slang first.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
The fingerprints on the knife confirm her guilt.
Can I wait here for them?
We can look for a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need directions.
It was ironic.
I burned you some cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I transferred him to Tom's schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a real damage.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun going to the party.
You didn't save the bell.
He's got me on his head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems to have stopped.
You're having fun with your youth.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
How come you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
It smells like meat.
Do I need to know you?
Tom knew he'd cover up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I don't think so.
She's running slowly.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in trouble.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it's time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just pulled Tom's room out last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a dead chest, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell this dog if it were higher.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there's no air since Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets.
You need to hurry.
Everybody's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a nun.
We despise her.
He's here in front of them.
Here, brother, half.
Tom worked on the table with the new masks he just bought.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's snooped.
The landscape is superior.
It's locked.
I found your papayas under your bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test it.
Freedom of expression was strictly limited.
We're gonna have to hurry.
Tom was celebrating the wine victory.
We don't have a whole week.
I'll try to bet.
Esena's here.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the traffic?
The water only needs three minutes to shut down.
They could fire me for this.
What's the plan?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was so great.
Dan was about Linda for a very short time.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
I want to take a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, they are endowed with reason and conscience, and they need to be treated one another in the spirit of mankind in general.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a thunderstorm.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to do himself.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
The soup's frozen.
Why don't you go and collect it?
Tom kept practicing.
Try to figure it out.
There's nothing going to cost you to fix it.
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Tom looked in the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend?
It seems familiar to me.
I'm jealous.
I offered to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
It's got its own limits.
With all that heat, I couldn't sleep last night.
Bosilot, agaphia, rosemary, timian, and orgina are popular herbs.
We're ugly.
You're a smart man.
It was all right.
Leave this here.
He's sitting on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door's open.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and books.
My brother and I shared the room.
I knew he couldn't trust Tom.
I know I keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
So I'm kind of flattered even.
I'm practicing.
She might have lied to you, but I don't!
Let's just get the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I'm sick of it.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled out some money.
The room was a buyer.
It's just to solve this problem.
They have to remove the bullet that was stuck to his neck.
Epten's fun.
Does Tom seem upset?
If you can, this weekend.
I know how it probably sounds.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but I guess I lost your sunburn.
I don't have a sword.
Suspect's confession.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
You don't seem to know how it hurts to beat you up.
We import grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but he did it.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to look in the dark.
Tom's busy with his research.
The wipers don't help against the ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the daytime?
I have a question about her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
Looks like we're not considering asking Tom.
My brother will arrive tomorrow morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Are you caloric compacts?
They'll get it soon.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary for the rib.
I broke the vase today.
That's what I care about.
I'm gonna go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't hurt you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make him some makeup.
I was waiting outside.
You're impressed.
You need to grow up and grow a little.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and your phone number?
Tom was throwing me with a stone.
Everyone knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so mad about Tom?
Tom will be here a few days.
I hope we're the last.
They stood under the stress in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I've got a couple of reasons to think about it.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't know Mary had cancer at all.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't really understand.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
Some of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They're all sinking.
I still think about her.
Today I found out there's a movie called "The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was away from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Is Tom still unable to write his name?
Tom put the journal in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many more days before Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I don't care about that.
Tom's got a granny collection.
She was making tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
The deaf are transporters to the plague.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom cut himself off.
I'll start tomorrow.
I wasn't honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write so well.
The king did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
I'm eating from Tom.
I want baked bones.
What did Tom do here?
She fell asleep while driving and caused a traffic accident.
We were bitten.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove it.
It was so beautiful.
Tom greets Mary with a cheering.
It's okay.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How is this camera used?
He was falling snow last night.
I didn't mean to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French very well.
Be careful not to overdo it.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
You need help with something?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, I don't understand German.
We're gonna need about three hours to get down from this mountain.
I'm just starving.
I was disqualified.
Did you finish the package?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's getting better.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get involved.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You're too thirsty for him.
The president announced that the United States would launch a satellite in orbit.
I can't borrow your book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be sweet.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I too early to come?
It sounds pretty strong.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Take care, Tom.
Tom's on the tops.
I can't turn it off.
We shouldn't have stayed up till 2:30.
You really do.
Do you think we should quit?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America didn't have the right to vote.
My neighbor called a fire.
Tom said I should talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom doesn't listen to us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Was that all the excitement?
Tom's gone somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm bell rang.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
It's a silent fact.
Is it delicious?
Watch out!
We should give Tom a chance to admit it.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a loving man.
Tom's getting a little murky.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
Tom gave up on his fate.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is similar to Bogotá, and Osaka is similar to Madeline.
Did you stop beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
I said I'd bring it.
Survivors are kind of boobs.
I'll start.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm cooking soup in a big tender.
If I get to know Jesus, I'll test his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell this to you if you're ready to pay the price.
Where's the volleyball going?
He wipes his wet hair with his foot.
If an adult lies to a child, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
I may not graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled the screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom was shaking his hands.
Open the teapots.
You can't let that match.
Tom opened the parade.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do everything.
Tom came to the next question.
That was thoughtful.
I want life.
Tom's not in his bed.
That was all my idea.
I don't want puzzles.
The book will help you write your skills.
This area is located in the valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
You said we'd never get her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
Please, blow the room out.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates laughed at her.
I'm sorry, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he already saw Mary this morning.
You know, I used to suck my honey toasters.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I've got a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the papal escaped from the cage.
We went to get some strawberries.
We live on the planet Earth.
I love sunglasses.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom threw his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's impressed.
I almost wouldn't come.
I was doing the cake.
Look at the number.
I was impressed by your design.
You told me to call whenever it was.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom's giving up.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
Last month, I had an infection of the force bubble.
Look at the girls.
I'll take off the kiln.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate the foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What benefit do we have from it?
I'm just with the one I want to be with.
You invited me to your wedding.
Tom just got fired.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "Okay, thank you!"
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be ashamed.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is quick.
The door's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want us to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone needs to stay.
We were completely confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has very good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom's not gonna be a sport.
Shouldn't we help them?
I wasn't sorry for them.
Tom feels he needs to be redeemed.
This message is for them.
When am I gonna get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom took the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not your shoulder.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not dating.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is a serious matter.
Mars is the red planet.
I took the dog with a stone.
Tom's staring all the time.
It's seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
Demek, I wrote this book myself!
Don't put so much beer in the soup.
Let's not be fooled.
They looked around.
Tom looked through the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom was drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need help from Tom.
They were happy.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you have to clear it.
Tom's not doing well today.
We don't see.
Mahmoud can't stand to die.
No one's listening to you.
Okay, convince me.
I'm ready for him now.
It's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and hatred usually go into pairs.
Tom didn't know that happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants were taken off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly.
I agreed.
Tom admitted he had the red wine thrown out.
Do you want a dog?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is good.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Did you hear about us?
We visited Laura's castles.
Tom's a hopeless case.
It's a little ahead.
I think of him every day.
I'll help you find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
It would be a pleasure to save him.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as much as you like.
Just grab my hand.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very pedant in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short time.
How much stomach do I do every day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned to go.
Tom's kind.
What was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Day's turned into a question.
You've got a lot of eyebrows.
Isn't that what you mean?
I thought you were tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We need to let Tom go back to work.
I want you all to shoot them.
I think I'm writing pretty well.
Are you going back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Get in there, then.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom seems rich.
Tom seems more reliable.
Do you want to drink water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the quantity is not correct.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little bit about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to the party.
Squares have four angles.
I kept working.
Dependency has developed.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll wait there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat down and shut up.
Bring the shovel.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
Mary was messing with her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
No one was listening to Tom.
You want me to get something from the supermarket?
Finish the mess.
Tom wiped out the knife from the farm.
Tom was struggling to stay focused.
Tom's got a long beard.
One of them addresses me.
I can arrange for that to happen.
Are your nuts bleeding?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his bowl of beer on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I spoke French.
I've got a seductive look on my face.
Come on, don't be ashamed.
I don't want to eat cloned animal meat.
How far did you go?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I'd better get back later.
What are the tigers eating?
I'm just gonna buy another one.
Are you going down?
Give him a dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how that's possible.
You looked me through the glasses.
Linda assured Dan that he was demanaging her.
Why would it bother them?
Let's not bother Tom.
It's tough.
I just need a break.
I got a warrant for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave rather.
I need to get rid of it.
Why is the sky blue?
Where's Tom's keys?
Did Tom get hurt?
Who could have broken the aquarium?
He came over my head.
Tell me what I'm looking for here.
Tom has struggled with depression for several periods of his life.
Can I get your bags?
I'd trust that with my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What do you have to worry about?
I need dinner.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class looks good.
There were pitches of penguins on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called a sniper.
I want to brush my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move it.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to talk in four eyes.
Tom's not impressed.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a town near Boston.
I hope you like the new boss.
Did you mention the results of the test?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was hungry.
She's studying English.
With such a great dream, he will become either a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We'll survive this.
We're here to apologize.
We'll visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom's spitting his chewing gum.
Let it be mine.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving me birth.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to develop bad habits!
She's starting to act weird.
Probably won't pay the money.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how she was interested in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
We're as strong as you are.
The president looked strong.
What do you want me to buy?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'm gonna be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you were playing chess better than me.
Is the bridge secure?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people are scared enough, things can happen.
You're a quiet town.
He was running as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is stuck.
Grab the day.
What's Tom's bell?
He's very handsome.
Let the buyer be careful.
Tom often runs away for hours.
Now it's time for a replacement.
Most virgins have a whole chemo.
You can get out at the end.
Why did you only spray two sausages?
When I feed the poor, they call me a saint, and when I ask why the poor don't have food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what there is for dinner.
Tom's interested in French history.
Because the bus had stopped, we waited a long time for the rain.
You'll be able to do it.
Is there that dog?
I'm resting.
Mary was wearing false twitches.
That's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he spoke French better than he really did.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
I got my shoes on.
That medicine calmed the patient down.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look stupid.
His mother's an American.
Relax a little.
Is Tom having fun?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx began to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
That means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Fusherski did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom seemed upset.
Please tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
I'm deciding, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blind.
I've been looking for him for a while.
Good work.
Tom's sick.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom always liked you.
We'll never know now.
Should we wait for him here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got rid of him.
I prefer goat cheese than cow.
We understand that.
How's that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten milk products in a long time.
I can see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Did you meet Tom?
Is everybody having fun?
I've been awake all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know he's with you.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was creepy.
Stolars are cutting wood.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
It's coming to an end.
One - half’s couples should not be able to get married.
The cow forgot it was a body once.
Give them the picture.
Tom was buried alive.
It's a manual job.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm so confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister drop the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you turn the cigarette off?
What were they laughing at?
Why would he believe her?
What's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a cab driver.
Still no sign of Tom’s voice.
Then I was home.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies give rise to other lies.
I don't have any more money.
Table is plastic.
The sun's light is supposed to be the best disinfectant.
You'll take a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always heartless.
You're getting tired.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very useful.
You hung me.
Did you call for quick help already?
After lunch, our plan is to take a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
The red light turned on.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
The first snow fell today.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much do you wear?
We need it now.
I don't know what you're looking for here.
Blood goes through the body.
I'll make him go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
They won't help lies.
My right leg hurts.
The apple's healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them presents.
What would the prince want?
Where are we from?
I really don't know.
Do you have a chopper?
Tom's fire for attention.
Day had no compassion for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave a message for her?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
Their houses are built from stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't know English, I don't know Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's going to bother you.
Tom didn't even think of things like that.
There's a wind.
I'm just kidding you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
And I bought a handcuff.
Just sit there.
Tom barely knows how to go.
So you said you wanted to go with us?
I expect visitors.
They saved the entire team.
What age did you begin to menstruate?
You're scaring me.
But not in front of people.
The firm's bankrupted.
I'm 12 years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not a lot of talk.
You were right, guys.
It's happening.
There were no other injuries.
I decided to take a train.
I'm sure you'll manage.
You gonna eat at home or outside?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, it'll get worse.
Are you laughing at me?
I think I know him.
I'm drinking milk.
Don't make Tom mad.
That's a tough task.
You should make him listen.
I'm surprised it's so easy.
Camoli would have been here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom often calls Mary.
Thank you, darling.
They increased the kingdom territory.
I didn't come here to hurt people.
I bet Tom already knew about that.
My mother's sister is my aunt.
I've been looking everywhere for them.
Tom's incapacitated.
My school has a band.
Tom can't deny it.
It's gone red.
I have to go.
Whoever sleeps with dogs wakes up with pain.
His aunt's all alone in London.
It's not a great miracle.
I'm sick.
This neighborhood is very lonely.
Maybe he'll come back tonight.
I fixed his radio.
This is a leather belt.
Tom's hooked up on the line.
When did I try to give you the money?
How's your mother?
It doesn't matter.
Listen.
Tom says he can pay for it.
She didn't show up.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him on your behalf.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you have these wise advice.
His excuse is far from perfect.
I hope we beat Tom.
Take your things away.
Where did you put it?
Tom doesn't know how to accept defeat.
Tom's my husband.
What do I get from that?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't very busy.
Tom told me he'd be back by the end of the week.
I want a room for a man.
You don't have to be present for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin it.
You're very passionate.
My headache's gone.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
Do you want me to ask him?
Give Tom a handkerchief.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that pretty?
Hey, don't let it be your fault.
Isn't that unusual?
I cut myself off the wall.
The clock's broken.
Tom must be stopped.
Isn't that excessive?
They know what happened.
Tom takes the scarf off his face.
Your hair smells like spring.
The tower was in the middle of the ruins.
Tom's a big materialist.
Tom says he's rich.
Just relax a little.
Have you read it?
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
Give me the spoons.
The Hassa worships cold weather.
This is a little sloppy at the rig.
Tom never lived in Boston.
Did you forgive me already?
Did Tom know?
Would Tom lie to you?
I'm not even tired.
She's afraid we're losing money.
Tom swallowed up his ex.
Canada produces good wheat.
He loves his dad very much.
Let's get upstairs.
It's not that we're doing something.
Tom had a good time today.
Milton hasn't slept well all week.
When's the big day?
I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he was planning to stay with us?
Give him everything we have.
It's not a secret that Tom disagrees with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you doing?
Now this is your house.
How about you try some sushi?
How are you doing?
I feel better.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life by doing only what I love.
It's not my decision.
Despite our expectations, there's been no charges.
The hunt is one of the seven deadly heats.
Tom's irresponsible.
I've always wanted to be a teacher.
Tom saw Mary ready to say something.
I'm not gonna be in town next week.
And they sown seed, and grew up, and reaped; and the river, and them that were round about, turned about.
He hates his father.
Tom helped us escape.
Tom had an accident.
Tom took Mary home.
I often ski.
I'll get the beer.
What other reason could there be?
Did you see anyone?
I have to be free.
I'm as qualified as Tom.
When will my turn come?
Tom didn't make it.
I'm a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a printed error.
It doesn't happen very often to buy a thousand-dollar hat.
Is the police coming?
We have to find him first.
Dan laughed at the assistants with his comments.
You don't have to go.
I barely got caught.
I can't get involved.
You beat them.
They shut up.
Tom's coming back soon.
I'd be in.
History is writing the winners.
Tom was the only one on the ship when it exploded.
Who's gonna make up for the cyano?
Tom doesn't like the house he lives in.
Nothing's wrong with me here.
You cheated on me.
It's for the heat.
Nothing's sacred.
Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
Actually, no one knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're messing with her.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted that way.
I was on three corners.
I'm here to talk about her.
We've got fish tonight for dinner.
I don't eat restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
Tom's almost there.
Looks like you've got an infection.
I don't think I'm getting anything smarter.
The sky is red in summer.
I'm here to wish you luck.
I'd love you to come too.
They must be happy.
We have to fix this.
I don't speak English.
We'll deal with it.
The bread is made of flour.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan understood this well.
Do you want a cookie?
Who brought this?
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
Dan may have had a fight with Linda.
There was silence in the room.
They all love him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a hard test.
It's hot here in hell.
I saw that.
This is your job!
Please come back to me.
Stay here.
Congratulations on the wedding.
Children, you're here to stay.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Are you kidding your dog?
It's beautiful!
The palace has a high tower.
The kids have homework.
Let's go get them.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.
You have to ask them first.
I made a phone call.
Tom's gone away.
I'm not sure Tom was the one who did it.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I won't mind if you leave.
Tom came here alone.
I forgot my joke.
We've been through a lot.
Tom wanted everyone to think he was dead.
Scientific research often requires serious compromises.
Tom just got his prosthetics out.
I have to try to find him.
I took care of it.
Tell me the details.
Are you busy with something?
Go wake Mary up.
You almost missed him.
I hate that pipe.
The doctor gave her a sedative.
Does Tom look like a man who's afraid of someone?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you as you are.
It's funny.
It's very relaxed.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was threatened.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why does no one want to help us?
The hole's tight.
You should go help him.
Do you enjoy it?
I've had a great night.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom's playing the sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the porch.
It's nice of him to carry such gifts.
I embarrassed him.
Shut up or they'll throw you out.
Get away from me.
Let's get started!
How long is the road?
I'm good, thanks!
Don't be late for the meeting tomorrow.
That's the message.
It's getting dark.
Tom's been raised.
I'm surprised Tom went with Mary.
He's blind from birth.
The book contains fifteen life stories.
Tom worked all night.
Tom was just here.
I quit.
How long have you been waiting?
The socks and shoes are new.
I haven't eaten pizza in a while.
Something wouldn't make me happy anymore.
I suggest you study more.
Isaac Newton died as a virgin.
Tom was buried in Boston.
Tom's not my cousin.
What's Tom talking about now?
How are you two?
Dilida died of overdose with sleeping pills.
His opinions are worthless.
Sign down, please.
Tell me where to find her.
It was really good.
Did you know Tom lived in Boston?
Tom, I only wore one shoe.
You don't want to do something that will remind them that you're actually not big enough to be here.
I got a lottery.
We could talk about music.
I slept like a curse.
I have faith in myself.
Tom's here, isn't he?
Oh, my God, he's coming back.
Ish, jukeley!
They're stuck in the water.
I guess you're busy.
Tom speaks French better than you think.
Let's all help them.
This is a glass mosaic.
Tom didn't come home at all last night.
I think we ate enough.
This is very difficult for them.
Witches don't cry.
Tom taught me to make pancakes.
The one who washes the car is Mr. Jones.
Tom seems exhausted.
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
I know Tom's in Boston now.
That's her.
I can transport you.
Is Tom safe?
Still, there's a solution.
You're unorganized.
I'm trying.
I'm sure Tom's gonna make it like this.
I don't think I've ever been so scared before.
Can you do the job?
We have to get back for him.
You're uncultural.
Are you sports?
It just sounds boring.
Bring him in.
Tom lied to us all the time.
Tom didn't say he'd help us.
Tom took the knife.
The people in Madrid are crazy.
That's totally wrong.
I'd better call her first.
He's very social.
Tom can't wait anymore.
I'm just practicing to look nice when I'm naked.
A thousand years make up a thousand years.
I'll put it on your account.
I'm planning on visiting Tom in Boston next weekend.
I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
It's an honest word.
We've got three guards working in a different way.
We can't stay together.
Visitors are welcome.
Would you be able to introduce yourself in a few words?
Tom was present.
I want you to call them.
Bring your toolbox.
Does Tom contribute?
This is a little embarrassing.
We were both busy.
I've been away for three hours.
I want crossword puzzles.
I expected them to be here.
Tom took a picture of this.
Tom shut his mouth.
So you don't hate him?
Stop acting like a child.
Tom's not a fire.
He never hired them.
I want cake.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.
Tom's in retirement.
That was very nice.
I'm going to hide.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
Soon he will leave his parents ’ home.
Tom gave up.
The luscious are barely visible.
Tom's a jug.
I'll take you home.
My husband's a doctor.
It's a spider bunny.
Tom didn't really want to live in Boston.

That new song is called "Little."
It's deeper than that.
Henry doesn't have more than six dollars.
We all have our price.
The answer to both questions is "no".
They're amazing.
The legend says she was a siren.
I really miss my mother's cooking.
Was Tom in Boston last week?
I'm used to talking in public.
You were crying luckily.
Tom's out of prison.
I'm glad I work here.
Where did Tom say he wanted to go?
I'm waiting for it to burn green.
Do you want me to bite your shoulders?
Get on my head.
I got right on my head.
Tom told me he was planning to go to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a completely different story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm going and I'm going.
I'm going to change my clothes.
You dropped my earpiece.
It might have sounded like a suggestion, but the order was.
Maybe I should just tell Tom I want my money back today.
You'd be a great mother.
Tom keeps working.
Please find my head.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom disagrees.
They rejected our first proposal.
Sooner or later, it'll blow my movie.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, but never really, it couldn't happen here.
Tom was burning himself in front of the fire.
I don't want to talk about this.
It would be very normal for you to be angry with Tom.
Tom swims every day.
This is the best thing I've ever tasted.
Why don't you call him?
I want to use these.
Tom's allergic to the mold.
You should try writing in a polite way.
I'll sit there.
She's older than him.
I burned their cake.
Tom's very patient.
We can start.
Come alone.
You're running a prayer out of your pocket.
Tom asked for his lawyer.
Write to Tom.
I had to help her.
Don't risk it.
Isn't that good news?
Let's assume she was here.
Tom always pisses me off.
Tom's just watching.
Here's your schedule today.
Tom didn't wait.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom's an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.
That was my suitcase.
The toy is made of wood.
Thank you in advance.
The question is, what are you gonna do?
Tom told Mary he loved her.
Well, don't be quick.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom seemed a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
He was back two days ago.
It's not a shame.
If you're late, I'll be late for you, too.
You really should have let me call a cab.
It's an apple pie.
The top of the horse's coat calmed him down.
Your hands are soft.
Can I see him again?
That's not my real name.
This book fully covers the subject.
I think this is over.
Linda was wearing modest clothes all the time.
You didn't smoke?
They let me go.
Tom never thanks anyone.
He called on his fellow students.
These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom's connected to Mary.
Are you just cooking for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to a zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna have to ask for Tom's permission.
His joke didn't all smile.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you've seen everything you need.
This is pointless.
They ate.
How many cup of coffee a day is too much?
Tom hates running.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I blew my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You'll do the same for me.
Now, let's continue this conversation in the next room.
I don't hate it.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I laughed.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Are you going?
I'm happy today.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop lying to each other.
Try to understand this.
What kind of man are you?
I should try to help them.
Can I gather a soul?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom earns three times more than I do.
I cried one.
Write your birth date.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
I'll call him later.
These are as good as they are.
She looked excited.
We're wasting our time.
Tom said he and Mary wouldn't be able to come to the party.
Just try and find him.
Tom put his coat in the closet.
I think Tom's tiny.
Is the difference visible?
Visit us tomorrow.
Tom was visiting Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did you ask Tom for money?
Tom didn't actually do that.
Is this your bag?
It will help her to sleep the most.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
I'll change the gardens.
They've been scanning for half an hour.
Dolcún has been doing a lot of intense work lately, but he doesn't see even the slightest result of it.
Dan found out Linda was looking for the police.
I'm getting dinner ready.
Please come to me next Saturday, if you want.
I'm not sure.
That's not necessary anymore.
Can you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary was.
The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?
Tom's fast asleep.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She was dreaming of becoming a nurse.
Tom has an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hatred.
You have a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thank you for coming.
I'm as tall as he is.
Tom wouldn't have succeeded without Mary's help.
So there's Tom?
The other night, he had her drunk in a meat loaf.
I'm in.
Do you need a rent?
Saul's gone.
I didn't say I trusted him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to repay you.
They're coming again.
You're really sweet.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
This is a no-good joke.
I wouldn't believe Mary at all.
I've never seen the grapes.
I don't think they followed us.
I feel free.
Just smile over and over.
You didn't notice the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom helped Mary escape from prison.
Tom doesn't have tea.
I'm tired, I'm gonna lie down.
But that's no argument!
Tom got a drink.
What should I tell the kids now?
Leave him, Tom.
I've been through the shock.
It's a good system.
I don't remember Tom like this.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew Mary was upset.
Tom started shooting.
How did you go on vacation?
We were just a few people in the gorilla group at the time.
She started rubbing her fingers in her hair.
I'll tell my wife.
If I don't invite Tom to my party?
Tom gave Mary a cup of coffee.
You travel a lot?
Did you tell Tom about the pain in your back?
That's what everyone does.
Tom is often unpredictable.
They loved each other.
Tom's collecting stamps.
I want you to find her.
The light of the sun.
And there's a lot of what's up with members B, B and A.
Tom's free.
Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You're a fraud.
It's generally known that you don't like Tom.
I'd be happy if you three came back out.
What's preventing you?
Tom has thin lips.
The kids are blowing bubbles.
Tom practicing violin at least half an hour each day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's very fun.
Let's do it tonight.
I felt their pain and suffered along with them.
Camoli Tom had more time for me.
I'm digging for him.
Tom had a bad day.
My grandmother's death was a big shock.
You're burning the car.
She managed to learn to drive a car.
Tom had a few more things to say.
Let's not panic.
I don't have the power of will when it comes to exercise.
Come on to Tom.
This is one of the best sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room's a mess.
At your service.
I want to watch football on TV.
I'd still like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need that kind of food?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in Boston.
Tom seemed a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom to my place.
Tom and Mary seem to be perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask for his money.
The more I have, the more I have to clean up.
I found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don't forget to mess with the sun cream.
Was it hard for you?
Tom's voice barely heard.
Don't be mad.
I decided to forgive him.
How many days are it usually necessary to get there?
Don't forget these.
When will that happen?
We're gonna have to reschedule.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or is she just fat?
Just get some sleep.
Tom's good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was a mess.
Music is just love in search of words.
Sitting all day is unhealthy.
Tom's gonna wait.
I'm begging you to settle down.
The real story is a little different from what you said.
It was your fault.
The balloon's coming down slowly.
Who wants insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Make three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you came?
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she immediately knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm totally naked.
Her gestures don't matter to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; you have to.
I did it.
Are you ten years old?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you happy to see me?
Marisol and Johnny are eating pizza.
It's not a great miracle.
We need something to get our thoughts off of the trouble.
I called yesterday.
Let me focus.
She sells sea schools.
Guard the prisoner.
We all like you.
The kid was crying and crying for hours.
I'll go ask them.
Tom's not like his brother at all.
Tom was an idiot.
That was brilliant.
Please tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you thrilled?
Tom wouldn't be able to do it on his own.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Let me introduce Mr. Tanaka to you.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the question to eight pieces.
Maybe you'll be needed.
I have chest pain.
I can't untie the knot.
Give me back my money.
You have to show up first.
My dad's a quiet man.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional drummer.
You stole my new handcuff.
It doesn't look very different.
It's over.
Tom and make room for Mary on the bench.
We're messing with him.
It's okay.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know whether to be happy or not.
Did you get her?
Tom wrote to me and told me about his trip.
Your excuse's up-down.
I don't know anyone like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still warming up.
Tom and Mary came out of the room, leaving John alone.
It's so complicated.
I thought you were funny.
The thief stole the precious stones last night.
Green light... red light!
Tom's your teacher.
I've already packed.
Since when do you feel the movements of the fetus?
I can't do it on my own.
You better let me do that.
This house is better than the other one.
I'm sure Tom did it.
Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm at the end.
Marry me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun and the night shine.
No one's getting fired.
There's no one else.
When I was traveling to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.

That's close enough.
Tom's polite.
Don't count on them.

You're such a pig.
Lock the gate.
Tom let go of the heat.
We're all the same.
I want to be next to you.
I think we're close to the solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
This sounds quite acceptable.
How do you know that?

Can't you help me?
I won't hesitate.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I'm not gonna miss it.

That's ugly.
There may be discussions about that.

It's time to get up.
This isn't your problem, it's mine.
Before I lay down, I drank three pills against the cream.
Maybe Tom's wrong.
They may need help.
I don't have any vodka.
Tom's acting like a rascal.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We need to ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me for?
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
They're very good.
You want some movies?
Time is forever.
First of all, you have no right to make conclusions, second of all, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
In the audience, it's boring.
I'm raising goods.
She borrowed the liner.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.

Come on, come on, let me help you more.
Tom's out of sight.
I think we're done.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the building's facade, and when I passed by her with a car, I didn't recognize her.
Is it only possible to have this?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the kids were sitting around the floor.
Tom, forget about it.
Invite him to join us.
It won't be easy to do that without much help.
Tom knows Boston well.
This time we won.
Tom works in a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
- I'm going to sit down.
This isn't about the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She looked as if she was deeply shaken by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we are not careful, the same will happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need some help.
I thought Tom was coming from Boston.
This is a very difficult test.
I'll get divorced.
That dinner.
My fat's leaking.
You're gonna have a fight.
Tom's a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The geese throw out the hot water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You don't suggest we give Tom all the money, do you?
Tom kept packing.
I don't have a home to go back to.
I'm here by my will.
It's to protect you.
I've always had someone to help me.
They don't want it.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He says he wants to see you.
He was right, Tom.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get any of them?
Can you connect to him?
Tom said if he wins the lottery, he'll buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I don't care about math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be kind to older people.
Precious stones include the aquarium, the amethyst, the emerald, the quartz, and the ruby.
Go find them.
You've got to ask your mother for permission before.
I'll take Tom's place.
What happened to you coming to Boston?
You're our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
You've got a lot of chicken.
It was a wonderful day.
I made him take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for a while.
I've been cooking fast.
Tom remembered a variety of things that no one else remembered.
You can easily distinguish them.
I'll go look for her.
Of all the languages I've learned, the French was the easiest thing for me.
Tom wrote home.
I counted up to 200.
Watch this.
Shall I go?
A boy looks like a monkey.
The peppers are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you do?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did you want?
We've got a fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you take the money on the loan?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Express your idea specifically.
Can I get out of here?
Everyone was so busy.
I lied to you both.
I'll lose everything.
I need food.
Tom showed up to Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I have a home.
He was breathing deep.
That's terrible.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman's easily upset.
Does he get there with a car?
I think I might be able to help her.
I'll do the right thing.
Tom has a lot of time.
I'll be fine.
I've done something weird.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom was always poor.
It's a beautiful alka.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom was embittered by Mary.
Was he alone at home?
He made a lot of money out of her.
Can you help me solve that?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only wish was to return to see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it on your own?
I'll go find someone else.
I'm too hungry.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make spiders.
You're really talking a lot.
Maybe it's too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
Tom doesn't always have to believe what they say to each other.
He's in love with his head up to five.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's oldest daughter is not married.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom's funny.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Tom's a painkiller.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're upset!
I think that's the only possible conclusion.
People sometimes ask me what to do when I'm retired.
Tom recognized Mary's manuscript.
I think you've helped enough.
It must have been her.
Where are we going to eat?
Tom knows how to do everything.
The sound soon died.
Who's scaring you?
I don't really understand it myself.
Tom's a good dancer.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
It's a police vehicle.
He knows the secret.
Tom was in bed.
He knows how the present palm trees are.
How do you know about him?
Just keep going.
Tom's a good friend, isn't he?
Say you understand me.
Tom was so tired he fell asleep without eating dinner.
How's Tom coming in?
There's someone on the threshold.
Tom wasn't getting away.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Let's try to call her.
It was a great day.
It was a wonderful night.
I think it's possible for me to pee.
Free.
Peter may need a new coat.
How's Tom at work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom doesn't talk to me about anything anymore.
I can't just give up.
Tom wants to swim.
I'll yell.
I'm not a run for you.
What's our situation?
Do you want me to keep it?
You're a real man.
Boston is a beautiful place.
Who's responsible?
I'm serious.
I think we better not drink water.
No one's talking.
What did you get to contact them?
Nothing can be done.
Do you have anything?
It's not cold at all.
Will you do the same?
He had witnesses.
I don't know why it's so hard to believe.
I don't want to be treated differently than before.
You should be all right.
I respected the rules.
Tom's a widow.
I think Tom's inhaled.
I haven't seen that movie yet.
You already did that.
You're poor.
Give me one more joke.
Many Russians were killed while taking pictures of themselves with their phones.
He believes that the old newspapers are still useful.
I want to be invited.
We see who's laughing, but not who's crying.
How old are you, Tom?
She was wearing red scarves around her neck.
The girl didn't say anything.
It was getting dark.
There's one thing I don't understand.
She's starting to relax by listening to music.
Try the shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
I can barely work now.
When did Tom say he was going to start his party?
This was obviously a difficult decision for Tom.
Maybe Tom would have been happy with Mary.
Dan was doing his job very well.
My legs still hurt.
I would do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I've passed out.
It's hard to assess his ability.
That's good.
I know the man sitting there on the other side.
I just had a vision.
You can't do this to me.
I'm open to everything.
I've been watching you before.
Stop where they are.
Are you her leader?
"She wants music, doesn't she?" "Yes, she does."
The barber's sneezing.
That's very interesting.
We still want to help.
I'm gonna lose.
Her sister gave her an injection against the flu.
Did you try to talk to Tom?
That sounds pretty stupid.
Tom hasn't stayed here for a long time.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started chasing Mary around the playground.
I don't have a name.
Why don't I ever win?
Tom fell off the stairs while he was cleaning his pants.
Do you have anything to add, Tom?
Quiet, you fool!
Sometimes I can't help myself.
Damascus is in Syria.
All the compositions were good except yours.
I don't think Tom will be at school tomorrow.
Please, this way.
We'll wait patiently.
Tom's a little pale.
Next year, my birthday falls on Sunday.
Everyone laughed.
Did Tom look happy?
Who wrote these messages?
Tom's making cracks.
Tom was breathing deep.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been to this cave?
Dan didn't want to go to the orphanage again.
We can start tonight.
He's a liar.
Tom's waiting outside.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
You'll never know.
I still think about him.
I thought it was causing me.
Tom looks lonely.
Shall we try again?
No one came.
How much money does Tom owe you?
Are you a vegetarian?
I can't find my pen.
Tom won't know how to use it if you don't show him.
You bought Mary something.
Nothing more like a lunatic than a drunk.
Take Tom.
Tom started taking off.
I know Tom times.
It looks nice.
We stopped in Boston.
This almost works.
I can't concentrate on all of this.
Split the cards, Tom.
The rebels tied his mouth.
Smile at him.
This medicine will ease the pain.
I'd like to say good-bye to you.
Can't he wait for that?
They'll pay for their superiority.
Dan didn't miss any episodes of that soap.
I love peppers.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the papers.
We have a few questions to ask you, Tom.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I hate her as much as you do.
We can get you some help.
I heard him.
We're investigating the entire area.
Don't forget Tom still loves you.
Tom told me I'd like to visit him tomorrow afternoon.
I'm gonna miss everyone.
Here we are.
Why do they do that?
I studied at the university for four years, and I got nothing but a poor degree.
This is priceless.
Do you want to draw?
It was pretty disgusting.
Tom's listening.
I don't plan on staying here that long.
We're together again.
After the fire, there's only ashes left.
Tom wants some kind of vegetables except for a plant.
Try to put yourself in his skin.
Tom used to write poems.
We'll take Tom home.
Tom needs to know about this.
I'm ready to compensate.
People can't make miracles.
That's a little rough.
They decided to exclude him from their company.
Those who interfere with the Glagolitic endings are waiting for a special place in hell.
What happened after the hunt?
You know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
Looks like there's them everywhere.
I didn't count on that.
I was unaccompanied.
I just saw Tom last week.
It shouldn't take a long time for this.
I'm trying not to dry up.
Tom's got to clean up.
We're very angry.
Tom's not that old.
Everybody knows how to drive.
Tom shuts down two pipes.
He was in the hospital for a week.
I didn't give her anything.
Tom didn't leave a good first impression.
Please, sit inside.
That's not my signature.
I decided to contribute exclusively with Spanish sentences all month.
That was terrible.
We're glad you're here.
You made something.
It's really bad.
You want a cough?
They say the blue paddles contain a lot of nicotine.
Looks like I'm feeling a little tired.
She gave him all her silver.
Do you speak French?
Tom doesn't want surprises.
My wife's a pure and devout woman.
I'll take it to Tom.
I don't think I can put the test.
I think we'll join.
Tom got ahead.
Tom's holding his car.
You're interesting.
This time I can win.
All the people of the earth came from a common ancestor.
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I don't.
I'm having fun.
We all have to go find Tom.
I'm fine.
Do you need help with this?
Tom, your patent's open.
We have a warrant to arrest you.
Tom's not going to the market.
I came to get him a present.
I asked her to describe it.
I was just showering.
I didn't do it alone.
What is she?
Can people really be so foolish to think that the entire population of Georgia, speaking Caucasian language that has no common backgrounds or common letters with English, can completely conquer the English in just two years?
I'm just guessing.
Tom doesn't want milk.
Our attempts were empty.
There are too many things I don't know.
He had respiratory problems.
Tom's good at tennis.
Berlin is very cold.
I'm the lunatic.
Tom was laughing.
Do you miss Boston?
I think you should call him.

These are for them.
Do you really have to work this weekend?
What's your bag?
I asked them to stop.
Here's my album.
I swear it wasn't me.
I have a great idea.
I got something for him.
How do I know if Tom's the right one for me?
Tom's studying agriculture.
I hit Tom.
Didn't you fix the pump?
Isn't that sound beautiful?
This isn't Tom's first delay.
How can you be sure?
We have to give them something.
It's not up to you.
The students left.
You've done so much.
Kate is very charming.
Where did you go?
Your path is hard.
You're gonna have to sit still.
Tom took his flute and started playing.
Tom wants to be rich.
That's perfect.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
Get him out of here.
Blood flows through the blood vessels.
You're borrowing books.
I can barely move.
Tom was wondering how good a singer was, Mary.
Look at my fingers.
You took my place.
Tom's bad.
My interest in politics is purely academic.
I'm not musical, but I'm singing in the shower.
You're lying to me.
They're playing a fight.
When did you buy that from them?
Let's eat.
I wanted to go home.
What didn't help us?
I want to learn French a lot.
We all have to die.
You hate us, don't you?
Dan learned the hard way.
You showed them the falsification of my friends.
I give my employees the right to leave early.
Are you here alone?
It's happening right now, isn't it?
The cat's on the roof.
What's in that closet?
Tom's too emotional.
I'm too low.
I'm sorry.
What kind of books do you need?
Tom asked me if I like Boston or not.
I don't like big dogs.
I'm thirsty.
He was eating a salad from a cup of tea.
I'm going to run.
Tom's got some gum.
I want to buy you a present.
It's stuck.
Tom had never visited Boston.
It's nice to be independent.
Tom's quite popular.
I have a big family.
Now no one can help me.
I'm glad you're back.
I'll get some ice.
Come and look.
Do you think you're cute?
Innocentness is most often a blessing, not a virtue.
Tom's on his pulse.
There's a restaurant nearby, but it's not very good.
That mistake is very common.
I know about the job.
When are you busy?
He was constantly bragging about how her boyfriend was kind, compassionate, courageous, and yet not knowing what.
Did you lie to me?
Tom wants to protect me.
Can you show me those pictures?
Let's go eat.
Why do you love me?
Tom trusts Mary.
You were busy.
I didn't know who else to ask.
They're doing it now.
Thanks to the victory, he became a hero.
Tom said he wasn't interested.
Tom's watching TV.
I don't know why I always have to be me.
They stopped going.
That's not a mistake.
I saw the sponge in the bowl.
I was born in 1980.
Tom loves his life.
The shape of the skull is different from that of different people.
I became uncomfortable with heteroormatic propaganda.
Go home to your wife, Tom.
I can't last much longer.
You better get yourself a reward.
That whole thing makes sense.
I'll open your door.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I asked you how you were.
I don't know how to behave here.
We need to advertise on TV.
Tom's insatiable.
They won't help you.
I feel great.
They're not there.
Nothing's right with me.
They have a good appetite this morning.
The rat made a hole in the wall.
Tom hated us.
How did you know I wanted to be alone?
You should be happy for them.
This priest is very hard.
Tom stopped crying.
All these things are waiting for me.
Is it real diamonds?
You know I don't eat meat.
It seems very sleepy.
I prepared a cake yesterday with mushrooms.
I hope it works.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Tom won't be home for lunch.
Is there a reward?
Believe in science!

Tom had no choice.
Poverty teaches you to eat bread without butter.
It is assumed that the temperature of the sun’s surface is about 6,000 Celsius degrees.
There's no need for that.
Do you know where to find them?
The crowd's freaking out.
Tom started working.
Tom wanted Mary to buy John's birthday present.
Cover it.
The police are looking for them.
What's the deep pit?
The bread is fresh out of the oven.
Tom won't believe it.
I'm gonna get Tom to examine him.
That was a shame.
I need Tom's address.
That's kind of sad.
I just didn't trust her.
It's possible Tom's gone.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
Tom's very smart.
Where did Tom want to eat?
I got Tom's keys.
Tom refused.
I left Boston three weeks ago.
It's ten o'clock.
I told you my father died when I was thirteen years old.
Have you ever written a letter to Tom?
I need three markers.
Do you need it now?
Do you know a lot about us?
Someone killed Tom.
Tom wasn't impressed.
That was really bad.
This must be yours.
We're here on time.
I was kind of sorry for you.
Cigarettes are sneaky for adults.
Tom and Mary left handprints in the liquid cement.
Cavaler would never do anything like that.
I love them.
Did you try hypnotherapy?
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
That was inconceivable.
This is wonderful.
Tom, don't do me to Tosho.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check on you later.
Is there any food?
I'll cooperate.
I bought him something.
I'd say no.
No one deserves to die.
Then I didn't know what that meant.
Tom never lost hope.
I need to spend more time at work.
In what situations would he do that?
I'd like to buy a room.
Tom never told anyone where he hid the gold coins.
Fortunately, the shed was stable, otherwise the storm would have destroyed it the other night.
I heard they caught her.
Tom's been written down somewhere.
There's no good news.
And who do you work for these days?
I'll give it up.
Mary’s eyes were filled with pleasure.
It's bad to be a dog.
I only have one minute.
Tom never gives up.
I think Tom's conservative.
How much are you guys doing?
I'd like a piece of pie.
I'm tired of your ongoing complaints.
Don't you care what's going to happen to Tom?
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I'm sure I'm right.
She's making herself mysterious.
Give me that envelope.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
It happened too soon.
You scared her.
Tom cheated on us.
What was I talking about?
Tom bought a coat.
How did Tom get hurt?
Tom doesn't want to come with us.
Tom will only tell you what he thinks you want to hear.
Let's not panic.
I wonder who's buried in your grave.
The salesman cheated on him.
It's all in the room.
It's Tom's office.
People are more important than money.
I paid the penalty.
I want to know who that phone call was from.
Were you home at ten?
It's closed today.
Please report to Tom.
I'll make her help you.
I called the police.
I can't give Ken the right to go abroad.
I was thinking about you.
Where could Tom be?
Tom's on his way to Boston.
I have plans for dinner with Tom.
She made me tea.
It's a simple thing.
I hear there's a lot of competition.
Tom saw Mary on the other side of the room and came to address her.
I don't need a cardiogram.
Do you want to go to dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I look forward to seeing Dad's new version.
It looks pointless.
I don't know anything about the future.
We're both from Boston.
Why don't you sing?
Did Tom really do that?
I didn't know how to play basketball at all.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
Tom's not gonna be a sport.
I'm dangerous, Tom.
I don't see anything.
Call your horses.
Did you read what I wrote?
Tom felt very lonely.
I really want to try new things.
Tom wasn't the only survivor of the massacre.
Let's talk about you.
Tom's not laughing.
I started seeing him.
We'll hurry up.
Haven't you eaten yet?
Tom found me a cab.
He did a miracle.
The irons are laxative to chemical substances in the body.
That wasn't my idea.
Tom's resting.
Don't run around.
It's best you don't talk that much.
This is a new model.
I asked for help.
Music unites.
This is just a simulation.
I'm glad to see you, Tom.
I kind of felt sorry for her.
He's too generous.
Tom was sleeping outside.
She hurt her leg when she fell off a bike.
Why do the rabbits have big ears?
Come here!
You could've refused.
Why don't you let me help?
It'll happen soon.
Hey, it's suffocating here, get me out before I suffocate.
It's gonna happen what's gonna happen.
I heard that story.
There's still darkness out there.
That's what Tom wanted to say.
Is Tom there?
I'll find her.
The police found nothing to link Dan to the robbery.
Do you feel guilty?
Many philosophers were from Greece.
Romeo is the one who loves Julia.
We have to help her.
Just listen to Tom.
Tom was acting decently.
Looks like I'm gonna have to wait a little longer.
You can leave and stay as you like.
This is your wine.
I just gave it to them.
This is the best ink.
Let go of my hair.
Can you talk to me?
Where's the meeting going?
Let's play real or challenge.
His conclusions are based on unproven assumptions.
There were a lot of girls at the party.
Tom started to list the book.
That's the right reason.
Tom loves flowers very much.
Tom told Mary to be careful.
I passed out.
I'm calling him right now.
Tom's not very kind.
Do you know who I am?
Why don't you listen?
His presence is important to me.
I knew we'd find him.
The sound of your voice is like a song of cheese for me.
I don't want you to put yourself in danger.
I'm fat.
How long have you been in front of a computer?
My wife's getting sucked out of the day's routine.
I want to know how you did it.
Amebites are single-cell organisms.
Tom said someone here needed help.
How long have you been in Boston?
Tom pulled my hand.
You're crazy!
How late was the train?
Let's park there.
That's very stupid.
It was hot yesterday, but it's tougher today.
I'm fine.
He was going in front of me.
Give it back to me.
Is he breathing?
Tom left Boston yesterday.
This isn't fair to me.
Maybe someone followed them.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston next Monday.
That's so boring.
The kid kept all the money in his wallet.
Come to know her.
They laughed.
I'd like to hear from him.
This is a leather belt.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the light.
Do you want me to come to you?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This won't work.
He's gone soon.
The children were so excited after the party they couldn't sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel very guilty.
I read his book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard for him.
You beat me.
Do you think we'll get to the station in time?
It was all right.
Mother was cruel to her adoptee.
International language would be of great benefit to mankind.
I gave them help.
You've made up your mind?
Dan asked Linda to sleep with him.
Tom didn't cheat on me at all.
That's unique and irreplaceable.
You can't just leave the baby.
Tom has mental problems.

She's kind.
What time is it?
Nice weekend.
Do you want some gas?
Tom stabbed the girls.
We had a terrible fight.

Japan as a country has many different features.
It's disturbing.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
The nuns used to play tennis at the monastery.
Don't be so perverse!
Tom wants evidence.
We didn't come here for them.
It didn't matter.
Here's your salary.
I'm sorry, I called the wrong number.
Put that gun down.
Tom's got little hands.
I'm worried.
I hate them.
I don't speak German.
The test included mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
Tom's over the money.
Have you ever kissed?
I'm trying to avoid them.
So didn't you say you know how to swim?
Don't pressure Tom.
They betrayed me.
And he's missing the paper.
Tom doesn't know how to express himself.
Attend the meeting.
I'll find a picture of how you kept your speech.
This sentence has five words.
He was eating lamb meats, potatoes, and soup from the mushrooms for dinner.
We waited outside.
He's not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier this way.
Tom lied to you.
I wouldn't go that way.
I wonder what Tom's doing right now.
It's hers.
That's not an option.
How old were you when you were divorced?
The French is heavy.
I rarely ask questions.
You're a prisoner.
Tom thinks I'm right.
The doctor's looking into the patient.
I'm sure I can find them.

The printer's not working.
I'll send you to the door.

There's no way he was Tom.
I'll kill you.
Most people have a strong resistance to getting up early, even when they have to.
Give me the gloves.
I watched Tom.
Who's there with you?
What are you so excited about?
Nothing's good enough for Tom.
Tom's gone mad.
It wasn't very good.
The mechanics should be able to understand in oil and motor substations.
How was yesterday?
You have to learn valuable.
We can't let them go.
They have families.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's have breakfast.
I'm sucking my omelet.
Tom and explain to Mary the rules in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
You're sick, aren't you?
I totally forgot about him.
An interesting question remained unanswered.
Tom thought Mary would enjoy the concert.
I pulled out my knife.
They danced.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I'm going to bed in ten and a half.
I don't know where it went.
There's a boy running to me.
Tom now seems very tired.
I'll follow your instructions.
I put it together.
Tom stayed calm.
You said you'd help.
The cells are the basic components of living creatures.
They're having fun.
I should go change my clothes.
How long do you work as a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
Chukunbaa died one day after my older sister was born.
He's been wandering for a few seconds.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom's sitting down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
I'm claustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he didn't know how to swim.
Tom's almost lost in the crowd.
As far as you know, I don't care.
No, I'm still a martyr.
This is hard for me.
Now how do you feel about her?
Don't surprise me.
That surprised me.
This is what we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn to the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why are you getting married when we kiss?
Someone will see us.
I'll give him another chance.
Tom finally laughed.
Tom's house is here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I just misjudged her.
It's almost done.
I didn't say I did.
Did you know my father?
Tom was about to shoot me.
Tom's talking.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He knows how to play the piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Don't talk like that.
I think we can get him.
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
God created the semen.
It's not too early.
Can I eat?
They dyed the frames of the yellow windows.
Tom, are you in here?
You can use this car.
Nice to meet you.
It's like I'm crying.
We have to wait here.
Is everything all right with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing his blood.
I have to stay here.
All or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
Nobody's talking about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
You and I will fly the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom doesn't listen.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does it start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at the auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour to the event.
You were amazing.
I won't give up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm's ringing.
The bird lifted the branch with the clown and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to go.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
It depends whether we buy it or not.
Tom's not the same man three years ago.
Everyone laughed at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom's unusually calm.
I'm gonna ask Tom to make time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell are you buying?
Tom was struggling to get rid of it.
What am I gonna do with them?
Tom didn't say anything to Mary.
It's not the right time now.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep all of a sudden.
It took a lot more than I thought it would.
Tom's running by Mary.
A cat scratched me.
Tom's not an old man.
The question is how Tom did it.
I swear it was them.
Did you have a bath suit?
His nose's the best.
Now I can't ask them.
Tom has defensive hair.
Long live the USSR!
It's hot.
I want to buy pineapple.
I was home yesterday.
That's my only hope.
Don't come for me.
It's just a question.
The bush is burning.
Tom was affected.
I've been bitten by conscience.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
The frogs are wonderful creatures.
There are three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom's drunk with tequila.
In other words, she's a little clumsy.
We humiliated Tom.
You're fucking a lot.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom's doing something.
You should've asked her first.
Tom's got a scar on his face.
Don't you believe us?
I respect you.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Was the trip nice?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You need to make a habit of brushing your teeth after each meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom collected his heart.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed outside.
This is the king's most confidential adviser.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change your clothes.
Tom was really mad.
I'll cook you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom's very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else am I gonna get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you could possibly imagine.
No one's gonna get hurt.
Tom gave Mary a handcuff.
I'm sure Tom added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice Mary's not at the party.
He's changing things.
It's too late to help you.
We tried to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom kept climbing.
Tom might be able to set your car on fire.
Did you hear that?
What did they find?
You lied to me in your eyes.
I'll go find her.
I wanted to change.
They're listening.
I wasn't aware Tom did that.
If I ignore him, he'll leave.
They'd just cut Tom's throat.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I taught him nasus.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach, and there they spent the day.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on strike.
He's a little deaf, that's according to his speech.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
You're up for now.
That's a super-explanatory explanation.
The snacks before breakfast are fresh.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read it.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them on their own.
Wasn't it horrible?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his harsh attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They set him up for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We're all eager to see the movie.
It's simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom wore his shirt on one.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
The dinner was so good!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, and division is not.
I'm kidding.
Tom took the hat off and bowed.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom will go.
Whose manuscript is this?
Did you see what it says in today’s newspapers?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks from three to six cafes a day.
Tom was humming loud.
It was better.
Tom started screaming.
I'll ask you to stay for a while.
We've got two goats.
I see Tom every day.
Everyone showed up for her.
Maybe Tom will die by morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be there in time.
Tom was freaked out.
This one's empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to be hearing about Tom for the first time?
Tom put his hand down.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
My money's jammed my glasses.
So it wasn't.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We all fancied for her.
Haven't you seen the Alo flag?
Get some rest!
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I think I found one of those.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
Tom's been out of food all week.
I don't understand.
Although I am a devout man, I am a man.
Tom's sorry he's late.
Are there any problems I need to know about?
Tom's got to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't get so angry.
A lot of people are hunting.
He deserves the reward.
Can I talk to you?
Where did we go?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
We need to look into something.
Tom open his eyes.
They can't go out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are you feeling?
Tom was drinking quietly.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started saying something, but Mary shut it up.
We met in a maean.
How was Tom?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned the whole city around looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
The drug must be drunk on an empty stomach.
Tom's not involved.
Looks like our job is not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
My curve has fallen.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
I baked you eternal bread.
The marzipan pigs don't chew.
Tom's awake.
Tom got mad at Mary.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
That's what Tom's doing.
Tom might be here today.
Tom doesn't differentiate between reality and fantasy.
Tom's a hero.
Tom has no power at all.
Will you help me?
Don't let me down.
Tom wasn't home when I came home.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Come on, now.
You better die on your feet than live on your knees.
They dig a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I've been home all night.
We got out of there at 11 o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that much money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
You only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it's from another dimension.
I'm bored.
What's the time?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they have a cure yet.
Each member must be present.
You didn't understand her joke.
This is the deepest snow I've ever seen.
She's hoping to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Do you understand his name?
It doesn't seem to help.
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
Bread is made of wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagrees with Mary on the subject.
You're right.
I'll go.
Today is my sixteenth birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar to me.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom's.
Did Tom buy gifts?
You two are very sweet together.
You're beautiful.
Tom and Mary were having fun together.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
What's the luck?
Dan wounded Linda's dog.
You blew your key bone while you were playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom's blind.
Do you really believe this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was found.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict Vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please inform them.
I have to call her.
He asked me if something was cooking for me.
Keep an eye on the road.
We'll stop by the way.
I heard Tom rising up.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerves on that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
It's time to close.
Let go of me.
The stone went down the hill.
She went to the freezer.
Tom's crazy.
Come on again!
Don't make his heart.
You don't have to comment.
The chicken's raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
That time, Tom was swimming.
Penguin's very sweet.
You're such a jerk.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
It was okay here.
They look exhausted.
I could make things easier for you.
Put the phone down.
I'd never get out of the house after the parrots.
I think Tom's a cepide.
He's sick of a terrible infection and the ovaries, and he's gone.
I don't need advice.
This doesn't work.
He's not going to consider it.
Tom's headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's always acting weird.
We'll hang them.
It's probably not a good time for this right now.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was very stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things I should do.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incapacitated.
Tom bought two tickets and you're gonna pop.
You're influential.
I got a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we make a cupcake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the smartest.
I had to protect Tom.
This is really relaxing.
Call him now.
Hold on to the subject.
She really wants to talk.
I've got tons of questions.
This is an interesting, funny, even shocking story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language is different in the world.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put on your pajamas.
This way.
This is a holy land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday's in July.
We have everything.
How many beers?
Tom said he doesn't know how to play tennis.
Where did you find her, live?
This was at the top of the pile.
I'm done with it.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't talked to me since we broke up.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know whether to sit or run.
Don't you think it's hot enough for the decoy?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Are you nervous about it?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm ringing.
I've lost my sense of time.
This island is an American territory.
Put 'em where they are.
Do you want to meet him?
I burned the cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are gathered in this room?
I've already thought about it.
I would do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You took off your ankle.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little sloppy.
Tom decided to become a vegan.
I don't have time today.
Nobody wants to buy these things.
Not even there.
The phone records are fascinating.
There's no need for you to be in a defensive position.
This is the best pizza in the whole city.
Mary obviously knows what she's doing.
Some things don't change.
