Republican Strategy against the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republic justified their policy of combating counterfeiting in the elections.
However, in the centre of Brennan, they consider the latest myth, claiming that cases of counterfeiting in the United States elections are less rare than cases of milling.
In addition, only 300 cases of electronic counterfeiting in the United States have been reported by the Republic's lawyers in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on the appearance of voters.
In this sense, such actions are partly discredited by the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most governments have since 2009 adopted laws that complicate the registration or voting process.
This event was new in November 2010, following the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to the Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, only 180 drafts were adopted for one year, limiting voting rights in 41 states.
New laws on elections require the elector to provide a certificate of identity with a photograph and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the right to register the elector on the day of election and withdraw the right to vote to citizens with jurisdiction.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state had obliged voters to provide identity with a photograph.
India became the first state to impose such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian law in 2008.
The Republican authorities have been speeding up the dissemination of this practice to other states.
During the past two years, they have initiated bills that oblige voters to provide identity certificates with a photograph in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity certificate like a medical insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, that is 21 million people who have reached the age of voting, do not have a identity certificate with a photo issued by the government body of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
However, the value of obtaining the required identity certificate often exceeds a hundred dollars.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of those earning less than $35,000, 18 per cent of the population aged 65 and 20 per cent of the voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required identity certificate with the photograph.
But that's not all.
Students - voters who are considered to vote for democratic candidates, in a number of states, are not allowed to use the identity of the photograph issued by their educational institution.
That is why the same states allow members of fishing and fishing clubs who vote mainly for the Republic to use the certificates issued by those clubs to vote.
By 2004, no State had required evidence of American citizenship to vote.
For the first time, such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the vote of the people from Latin America.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are expected to vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, the Republican legislators introduced in 2011 laws that abolished voter registration on the day of the vote in eight states.
They have also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
This restriction has not been without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, a voter registration campaign helped to list about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have resulted in a decrease of 17 per cent in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the voting period.
Thus, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters voting in advance were African Americans, although the latter accounted for only 13 per cent of the total number of state voters.
The same thing happened with Latin Americans.
Only 11 per cent of the voters represented 24 per cent of the citizens who voted in advance.
Unlike the whites, which accounted for 76 per cent of voters, only 46 per cent of the voters voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws limiting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were promised by democratic governors.
The most controversial legislation was suspended with the intervention of the United States Attorney General.
This has allowed for a partial limitation of the negative effects.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring the identification of the person with the photograph.
Nevertheless, the new rules that have come into effect will, of course, make it difficult to exercise the right of election at the 2012 elections.
Critics from Democrats condemn the precepts of the laws that have been adopted, with a clear focus on affecting the outcome of the 2012 elections in key states.
The report of the Brennan Centre since 2011 shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of 270 votes required in the electorate to win the presidential election.
It is too early to confirm with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the appearance of voters.
In this sense, such actions are partly discredited by the system of American democracy.
Screening the cancer of the front iron: pass the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes produces misleading, false, and sometimes positive results that lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctantly dissident, have even more doubts.
Is the test going on or not?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
Studies conducted in the United States have seen numerous cases of infection among the study groups, and therefore it is difficult to interpret and make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a different level of mortality among the patients who had been screened and those who had not passed it.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the likelihood of metastases was 30-40 per cent higher than those who had not been screened.
Therefore, I would recommend that the test be conducted at 50 years of age, or at 40 if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin are also at high risk.
The key point is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and powerful.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his or her cancer by offering possible options without the mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a long-term risk to life, and by making the choice, in these cases, for the benefit of active surveillance of the disease.
To date, many men with cancer have not been treated, since their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to life.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease starts to progress, we will start treatment.
More and more, we accurately define the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo a treatment course.
I would therefore recommend that the test be carried out anyway.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether this test is necessary or not.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember has established an instrument to assess all for and against the conduct of the PSA test.
This document will be available in English as soon as possible: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening
Preventing the Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in scientific research, keeping a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people were well fed and moved enough, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one had ever smoked again, this figure would have increased to at least 50%," stressed Andre Bolie, a press secretary of the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cancer cases are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain unexplained.
For the Canadian Association, smoking cancer remains a priority, despite a reduction in the number of smokers.
Smoking is related to 85% of cases of mild cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It brings enormous damage to human health.
"Even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says Andre Bolé, Press Secretary.
The encouraging fact is that 10 years after smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Wes
According to the CAR, excess weight and obesity also contribute to the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fat and direct oxygen, food, fertilized iron and mother.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against cancer,” the Association adds.
Question
The Association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large a number of cases, it increases the risk of the cancer of the colon.
The use of sausages should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by digging, drying or planting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter may harm the cells of the body and lead to cancer development," the Association explained.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the impact of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But at this point, the results of these studies cannot be called definitive.
According to the SCC, vitamin E studies produce contradictory results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of developing prostate cancer, the other resulted in the opposite.
The impact on the development of vitamin D cancer is also not fully clear.
However, Mr. Bolio stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with a doctor.
"Adequate analysis doesn't lead to cancer."
Bozon Higgs in detail
Last summer's report that scientists may have been able to detect Higgs' bozone caused the present aviation - not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, not much.
In addition, it is the last particle that has been predicted in the Standard Model - our best, or, in any case, the "minimum" description of nature and the behavior of matter - but which has not previously been able to identify by experience.
But physicists are not sure until the end that it's about Higgs.
We know, without a doubt, that we are dealing with a really new particle, and that it is strongly reminded of the Higgs boson, predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, although some data are not yet available for full certainty.
Let's imagine, however, what's about the Higgs Baron, because the chances of misbehavior are minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, a law that is absolutely inevitable that two things cannot be at the same place at the same time.
There's no way you can do this, not even try too hard, or you'll hurt yourself.
But although the physics of the elementary particles is rather strange, it is said that there is also one law of a similar nature: the principle of the exception of Paul, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum" state, that is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
As a result, physics divides particles into two categories.
In one corner, we are well-informed citizens called farmers who wisely obey the principle of Paul.
On the other hand, the bozones, the angry band of anarchists who have no respect for anything, at least for this principle, mean that they can be at the same place at the same time.
According to the site (sometimes, quite unusual) of the Parole Adventure Laboratory Berkeley, these bozones are divided, in turn, into two groups: mezones that we are not talking about, and "power particles", through which the main forces of nature are distributed, and which in some ways refers to the Higgs bozone.
These very bozones should be emphasized, not all such exotic substances, as could be thought of.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it's because of one incredibly banal boson, a photon, or a "part of light," which is the "currier" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "breaks" the electromagnetic field in that particular place, about like a stone thrown into the dust.
This “infraction” produces an electromagnetic wave (world, or infrared emissions, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photonomial, and is therefore one of the “power transferors”.
More stable fields
The same is true of Higgs's bozone, with only the difference that in order for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must be broken.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable in the electromagnetic field; in order to trigger it, it needs to achieve very and very high energy, as if it were a frozen stream, whose surface could only be damaged by a very large stone.
That's why we need a huge particle accelerator, like the one operating in CERNE, the Big Adronite Collider, a 27-km-diameter ring, to achieve such enormous energies.
Similarly, the analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful to explain the relationship between Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, while others do not. For example, the paper sheet will never be held on the refrigerator itself.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (such as photon, etc.) do not have it.
So, what can all these studies do, Mrs. Plamondon?
They are used in science to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), which also enables physicists to discern the difference between the results of observation and the forecasts of the PM.
In addition, some of them are eager to find such a gap, that is, a minor inconsistencies can open the door for "new physics" and shut down some of the Model holes.
The last thing to say is that there are still significant shortcomings without providing any explanation for gravity (uh!) or for the dark matter that forms about 80% of the universe (uh!).
But until the CERN found such differences.
Consequences
The benefits of these studies for the everyday life of a medium-statistician would be more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that it did not exist.
Note: In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in Bella's laboratories could not even imagine what the revolution would call for.
They predicted their applications in science, but no more.
In fact, a late physicist, Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell's Laboratories, where a laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the previous were pulsed) in 1962, said that the laser was initially considered as a "laboratory gadget".
Imagine...
In addition, the annex can be found for the accompanying study tool.
For example, the same Williard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his optical research.
This sensor, although it was not originally intended, now serves as a "eye" for all digital cameras of the world and earned the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Greater Adrian Collaire will necessarily change our lives, but it just shows that everything can be.
Palliative assistance is the best way to die...
The Commission recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life in Quebec for worthy of death.
The debate must be resumed soon and the bill is being prepared.
Nevertheless, much remains to be done in this critical area.
Long tried to look closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. Another man lived in his apartment in Monterey.
The cancer of the prostate that destroyed him inside gave him a two-year delay.
"I was five years old, I lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the reception of the palliative care of Victor Gadbua in Belyo, where he arrived early.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for it," he says.
The disease is doing its job: an incredible weakness that does not allow itself to walk into the toilet and even to eat on its own.
Sitting at the dining table, he gives up and agrees to help him eat.
He dares, even dares to smile, talks to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, take him to the bathroom.
The courage before the usual death.
"My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
"We are taught during life that a man should wash himself," says Pierre Broder, psychologist at Victor Gadbua's reception.
Regress to the status of the child - for some unbearable humiliation.
"All depends on the ability of man" to settle down, he argues.
As many people in palliative care believe, important events are also taking place in the worst part of the situation.
Patients entering the Palliative Hospital of Victor Gadbua are all sick with cancer.
Forecasts take them for a maximum of three months.
At this stage, the medical team and nurse are no longer providing assistance called "medical".
Mrs. A., 89 years old, the most afraid of dying "in the consciousness of drowning".
But that's why the pain made me know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything more in life," she says before letting her put on a breathable mask.
She is still waiting for the next days for her son to visit from Italy.
In admission, Victor Gadbua, with the help of a group of volunteers, provides body care and food assistance.
This is a palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in palliative care facilities.
It's very small, given that sooner or later we're all gonna die.
Here life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the foster doctors.
Be comfortable physically, emotionally, or mentally.
We agree with the dying to provide oral palate from a brandy or pepsy, given that he will ask for it.
We don't have to control sugar levels anymore.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought Mr. H. a beer that died tonight.
In the morning, his son got this beer in his leg and died.
"We help our loved ones, as well as our patients," says Natalie Savar, director of care for the sick.
Victor Gadbu's reception doesn't look like the previous day.
A number of 93-year-olds who enjoy their last meeting with their family in the yard, sitting on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically die a young man 36 years old surrounded by parents, wife and two little children and tried everything to survive.
"In the last half of the year, between three and five cats have always been treated with cancer at the age of 45," said Dr. Christian Martel anxiously.
53 per cent of patients admitted to Victor Gadbua's shelter come from the house and 47 per cent from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care provided to alleviate the suffering of patients entering the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or in the hospital.
And some institutions, such as Victor Gadbua and the Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in care for cancer patients.
It is this great breakthrough in Quebec's health system that causes many palliative care doctors to fear the adoption of a law that legislates euthanasia and suicide aid.
Since October, a manifesto signed by palliative care lights, Dr. Balforom Mount and Dr. Bernard Leapont, has been circulating and demonstrating their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Kristian Martel, the health system in Quebec is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before a transition to euthanasia is permitted.
Recently, she said, "I've seen a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency ward in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to relieve them.
I'm afraid patients just want to die because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists have tried to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic predictions.
The hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard were already minimal when she had stopped her insidious chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I was stopping the fight, she told me.
And she told me that my days were counted!
There is no universal care.
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the patients who ask for death thank the hospital staff for not complying with their request after the palliative care team eases their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely essential in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care in the Palliative Care Society at the House of the Greater Montreal, patients do not accept treatment in 8 per cent of cases.
At the very end of life, physicians often attend a palliative session, where the patient sleeps until his death, from time to time, or at all times.
We can't pretend that we don't know about these sufferings anymore.
More and more sick people who are unable to relieve their pain will be able to have access to the palliative session.
The sick who suffer from pain always say the same word, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to be euthanized," that means "I want to make it easier for me."
The creation of this report was made possible through the Journalist Grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Studies.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, political party funders and Italian mafia experts tell of what they know about the huge “system” that drives the construction industry, public servants, politicians, trade union actors and mafia.
Industry, which was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's lovely to see this system unfold after all the funds have been put in place, Jack Dusheno, the deputy and former chief of the Montreal police."
It was the result of the scandal in 2011 as a result of the investigation of official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, which the prime minister of that time from the Liberals, Jean Share, agreed very reluctantly.
The report of Dušeno established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
“From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stressed that only one of the Ministry of Transport would retain a billion dollars in contracts”, if some had held back their instincts from taking part.
The Sharbonno Commission “has already moved two mayors”, he adds, hoping that it will be able to “cover the schemes of individual individuals”.
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The case was brought together by the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011, which included a large state of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the staff of the Special Unit Molot, which had imposed Montreal ' s " estate cartel " after 2009, had stopped the value of contracts.
During the past few weeks, a series of searches have been carried out, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Richard Markotte, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
In turn, Jill Vayangur, recently retired from the position of Mayor Laval, third in the size of the province of Quebec.
It is suspected of multiple receipts in the placement of public procurement orders.
In addition, an official indictment was filed with several communication engineers and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akurso and Lino Zambito.
The last was the bomb by conducting an investigation into the "system" of public contracts.
For several years, Zambito had spent 3% of the contract value in Montreal, a broker related to the Mafia who, in turn, had transferred the money of Mayor Gerald Tramble's "United Montreal" party.
In the 2000s, Zambito spent money on the right and on the left, listing more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) for the different provinces, mostly liberals then in power.
He also recognized that he had illegally collected funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party of Natalie Normando.
Consolidation contracts in which value has been exceeded
In Montreal, the corruption system worked smoothly.
Zil Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received from construction companies gifts, trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and a total of $736,000 in exchange for sewerage contracts whose value he had exceeded.
Other road-building officials recognized that they had received a 30-40 per cent increase in the account by false supplements.
Then an organizer from the mayor's party, Martin Dumon, accused Mr. Tramble of having deliberately closed his eyes on the existence of a parallel budget filled with dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr. Tramble retired early in November, loading Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rolo was one of the first MPs in Montreal to be alarmed.
The mayor of the River-de-Perry district in the east of the island, it has opposed the sale of a municipal facility purchased for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million for the construction of the building.
70 per cent of dirty money in pre-election campaigns
She said that in the investigation, which would eventually begin, she “suffered for a thread to understand the functioning of a system that was squeezing with ants to stop the gangrene and to identify the perpetrators”.
This process is characterized as “sick but positive”.
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How we're going home.
Regularly.
Jacques Dusheno notes that “the perpetrators have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars”, but he is particularly concerned about the role of “election officials who know about the scheme” but who are not involved in the crafts.
Considering that the share of dirty money in the financing of the electoral campaign in Quebec is 70 per cent, he jokes: "I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit to $100 donations to parties, but it does not say that this will change the situation: "Until we strictly limit the election costs, the policy will be dirty."
It requires a full restructuring of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: “We cannot go down below; we can build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legitimacy, if we are courageous.”
If this story leaves a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dušeno calls on those who laugh to look into their own court...
"PZ - not FK Barcelona!"
In this season, you've reached an unusual range in the GSP.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but may also be by a new measurement of GSPs.
Big games have come.
I grow up with them every day.
Technical personnel have also made a lot of contributions.
These factors make me raise my game level every day.
And during the match, it's easy.
Everything happens very quickly in football.
But I don't burn.
From the very beginning at the pre-training centre in NIF in Clerfonten and until my arrival in St. Etien, I have always been moving forward.
So you're benefiting from the competition established by Carlo Anchelotti...
Filling this summer is not in the news to play a very high-level match.
They also know that each training is very important.
This leads to a game like me wanting to be at the level and going as far as possible.
Also, Carlo Ancellotti supports my position.
He's been assisted by alternates like Claude Mackele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancholytti is the owner of the situation?
Of course.
Ancholytti respects all technical personnel.
Today, he is not equal in the First League and is one of Europe's best trainers.
He had extensive experience, and he won many high-class titles.
He worked with big players.
I think he'll bring new Paris titles.
I had a very encouraging conversation with him in January.
Then I left the whole series of traumas.
The confidence he has given me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSF season?
In the First League, Lion took our leader's place.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we have effectively qualified in one eighth final.
What's the goal of the club in this tournament?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
It can be all right now.
We can say our word to the person with very good European teams.
We first want to finish the first in our team, in front of Porto, to have the opportunity to take a response match in one eighth final.
Could the PSC become a first-class European club in the short term?
He's got a budget for that.
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and position in the long term.
It's not like that today.
The GSP has financial resources to make this project real.
Not taking the title in the First League, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want to get this championship title.
Last season, we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we had everything to come to the finish line first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points are called the champion.
But the other team, Monpele, played a more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the fact that the title struggle has taken on strong teams such as Marcel, Leon and Bordo, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media is waiting too much for the PSG?
It's normal for us to expect a lot, given how much we've been invested and what games we have.
We're all ready for that.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Trua at home, and we still find something to criticize, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We ask the question of what people are primarily looking for.
We'll never be able to win every exit with a 4-0 account.
We're not the Barcelona FC!
We're trying to introduce a game project.
The command is formed in time.
We have proved in the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which no longer has two seasons been able to go to one eighth final, even though they have also spent a lot of money!
In view of the amounts invested, we have presented you with 15 points ahead of the winter break.
That would be a disregard for our opponents and for the French championship.
Lion and Marcel, who were not high in the past season, were "swallowed" by these new GSPs.
This shows how interesting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The GSP seems to depend entirely on the crowns of the Gold Ibrahimic.
Well, what if they say there's some kind of gold dependency?
This just means that Ibrahimic is very successful and that he kills a lot of heads.
He's here for this, and he proves he's the star of the First League.
The star where he was playing, he showed that he was a great player and a world-wide star.
In the group, we respect him as a man and as a player.
He also respects those who surround him.
What he did is really exclusive.
It also stimulates others to improve their game.
Its Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all to move forward.
How did you survive Euro-2012 with France?
It's a disappointment.
I really wanted to take part in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me from spending some time playing.
I've seen a lot of things out there, and I'm out of here stronger.
I'm gonna be able to play good fights today.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was born in the Blues.
We learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now they have to be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Desham in the head of the Blues?
They're good for him.
He's got a good position in the front team for the world championship.
He's a strict coach, he's close to the players and inspires victory.
What Lauren Blanc was like.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc reached his goal, he qualified us in the euro.
I hope Didie Dasham will bring the Blues to Brazil.
The good deed (1-1) that was issued in Spain on 16 October is a fundamental match?
This match has given us faith in itself.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that, the shock in Spain, my career was like no match.
Pay and sell without bank help - with Bitcoin
The full contradiction between the current currency exchange based on central banks, the transactions recorded between the receiving parties and the commissioning fees for their processing.
In addition, as is often the case with these technologies, it is clear that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (psedonym), is also a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euro ...) and a protected protocol for the exchange of BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between participants of the same level.
Some 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers in the network.
A number of thousands of sites take the beatings to make donations or as a means of payment.
The ticket price, reaching a maximum of 30 dollars (EUR 23) in June 2011, fell to $2 months later, before returning to about 10 dollars today (courses are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing is special compared to the world ' s real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in its report on the virtual currency published in October.
He described the biticon as "the most successful virtual currency", "competition with the dollar or the euro" and "like the usual currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as “credit” used to promote video games that are earned in the game process or that can be purchased (and sometimes exchange).
The Facebook social network has also developed a similar system.
But the exchange operations always control and process a central body.
In Bitken, all networks are also accountants, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.
Only for each new payment can the user choose another address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically using a double key encryption system.
The network can also verify the trueness of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is possible to verify that the bets used in the transaction actually exist in a public account book distributed throughout the network.
A key step is the registration of a new transaction in this book.
It passes through a mathematical task sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, has the privilege of adding this new line.
This is a phase of file manipulation, that is to convert a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number before "hashing" it all together.
The goal is to find a number that will be a unique digital signature (very zero at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, other angles are easy to verify that it is correct.
The transaction is thus indirectly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the sake of deception, the user wanted to pay twice the same money, only one of the two transactions would be confirmed by the network and the other would remain unconfirmed, as they had different electronic signatures.
The computer that solved the task gets 50 beats.
In order to avoid inflation, the prize will be divided regularly by half by the end of 2012.
So the number of bets in treatment is limited by 21 million, but they are divided into one million, leaving another reserve...
The complexity of the task is also increasing with increased computing power.
Network life has already been affected by accidents and falls.
The Bitcoin service sites were attacked and the battles were stolen from the reserves.
"The defect used does not concern the protocol itself," said Pierre Nouaza, who recently launched Paymium, a real money-paying company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But money also has a lack of it.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to make such sacrifices.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, are allowed to do so.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weitzman Institute in Israel analysed the book and found that almost 80 per cent of the battles were not on the move.
Giant sales were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," said Yoon Holmkvist, who works in Coinabul, who is involved in the conversion of biticons into gold.
Pierre Nouaza, another author of this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in the present money) or a wireless payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which makes it cheap.
The owner better controls his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is simple for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
Just provide an address that can be “photographed and identified” by the phone, explains Pierre Nouaza, confirming that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in the revision of hierarchy systems in favour of more horizontal ones.
"Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 can become a turning point," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB intends, in fact, to review the various risks that are considered to be high today in the case of the success of the system.
We're out of Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capis and Surabi).
NATO and Americans must follow them by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not just hope for us.
We suffered mainly Afghan peasants, whom we considered terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and killed.
The Taliban is made up of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often of Christians who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case with the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, and even join the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbek, Tajiki.
They're patient, sometimes they're helping the local rebels, but they're not going to be as close as the West is going to be more sensitive.
The withdrawal of the French troops from Nidjrab base, which I observed from the heights of the trees planted by the French credits, was fine.
The convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban invasion in Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their insurmountable progress from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the fight between different groups.
They were then taken under the control of the country as their kind of release, return to security.
The Afghan women paid for the darkness of these peasants, in which Al-Qaida surpassed them, but their situation has not improved in our day.
The former Mojaheids, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in subjection.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become parts of State-owned lands in order to resell them to return to the returnees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, using huge US subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them, in fact, did not fight.
People, as I heard in the rural area, want a government that wouldn't be out of doors.
Many young people want to leave as those who have earned American generosity go: the flow of capital is significant.
Young people have stopped the war and its ideology.
They lived in a modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its benefits.
About 65 per cent of the population are under 25 years of age; in Kabul there are now 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the population.
State schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
There is a need to provide jobs for these young people who will not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed fighters, love mobile phones, television and Turkish mill operas that represent the modern world and that are watching everywhere.
There's an army right now.
Will the authorities who will command it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle have already taken steps to restore provincial women who would not be subject to the central authority.
Afghanistan, with strong local differences, must be decentralized to a certain extent, in the form of Western countries, but the United States wished to turn it into a centralized State with a strong presidential authority, removing the Prime Minister's post that had existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, beginning in the 1950s, and even before, depends on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put on foot, not one platinum is working, and not one irrigation system has been refurbished.
All are imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is given to the private initiative.
In a country that has been destroyed by war for thirty years, State control of infrastructure would be necessary.
They heard that Afghanistan had enormous mineral resources.
This only strengthened the sense that the Western countries were present only to take possession of them.
No energy for the processing of iron or copper on the ground, no means of transport to export them through the mountains, there are no profitable mining.
The Chinese have almost left the place of media Mess Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers in the province.
It is also necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations in one fine day.
The departure of the French military units was completed on 20 November.
The new treaty on cooperation provides for the maintenance of traditional assistance: a person for girls, boys, a French language faculty at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to “conquer the heart and mind” and to carry out the impossible task of matching aid with offensive operations, the service of “military-citizen activities” with the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, along with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public work and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These efforts, with the intensive involvement of local labour force, have helped to sustain the resurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, restoration of forests, fruit trees, soil protection, and the increase in the area of farmland.
What will we keep in mind when we spend two billion euros on military expenditures?
A much smaller budget would help to improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very severe in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural work from local communities in the province of Kapis.
To get rid of the ups and downs of foreign groups, which farmers want, as they have told me, they need little non-military support that would be well controlled and directed.
The Difficult Generations of the Constitution of Egypt
This is a new risky move by President Muhammad Morris.
While Egypt was divided more than ever on the issue of a constitutional declaration, which temporarily gave it extraordinary powers, it decided to play a va-bank.
As a result, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text for the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State provided the Assembly with two additional months to complete the work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been relying on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only strengthened the division of the country.
In the view of his opponents, the President insists on his “autocrat board”, continuing to “infringe the word” and “support the right”.
His followers were assured that this was a way to end the institutional and political crisis by speeding up the transition process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
It is a very short time for the Brothers to give up their intention to explain the text, article after article to the Egyptians.
For the President, this is also a way to restore social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent is taking place throughout the country.
Muhammad Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians are voting positively, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
The more the call for an accelerated vote comes from the elite of the Egyptian people, "or you vote for my text, or I leave an extraordinary mandate," which is supposed to end after the Constitution has been adopted.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamic, voted yesterday for the text.
Most of the Liberals have not responded to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked on the door, feeling unable to bring their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, the reserve participants, were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators, for example, have made it difficult for the fact that one of the few differences in the day came about... time for prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the time of the Constituent Assembly was wrong.
The text on which the vote was taken yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, article 2, ultimately remained an identical article of the 1971 Constitution, which states that “the principles of the Shariya are the main source of law”.
The Salafiist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law is a fundamental requirement, hoped to replace the “principles” with “rules”, which would enable them to be more rigorously applied.
For the Islamics, the fact that this article has not been changed is evidence of their good will and respect for others of Egyptian society.
"Licemere" is the responsibility of the liberals who only see the pier.
Because they believe that Islamization of the Constitution is being done through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with Shariat.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pome, it is alarming, that is, “people who are meant to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.”
We can observe the birth of theocracy."
Many liberals are also excited by the fact that the next Rector of this university appears to be less moderate than the present one.
"There is no specific religious interference at present.
With this constitution, we remain under civil law.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not interested, but people with university education, some have been trained in the French system," says Alexis Bloe, who prepares a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he acknowledged that “the scope of article 220 could result in inequality, as the terms used therein were borrowed from religious lexicons.
This refers, in particular, to the "fikh" [Islamic jurisprudence, or order.]
And in the future, there may be a question of how many civil judges are competent to make decisions about this."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday was criticized, as it gave wide authority to the President of the Republic.
Muslim brothers claim that they have been significantly reduced by comparison with those of the old regime.
Another controversial moment: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defence budget will be considered, not in Parliament, but in the National Defence Council.
Nor will the courts of civilians be prohibited in military courts, despite the requests of human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text that they considered to be harmful to freedom.
The responsibility for blasphemy has been maintained, and the abuse is now prohibited, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
Furthermore, none of the articles speaks of the protection of women, Heba Moraef, from Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak yesterday evening on television, the demonstrations were scheduled for the afternoon.
The Heads of State will, in turn, go to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, Pop Earth and the Sea of Dessal
The Promised Land unites itself with the grandeur of Bible truth, modern comfort, and natural beauty.
The AIF has identified five of the most important reasons why Israel should be present.
Worship in Sacred Places
The Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized, is worth the journey.
It is believed that all those who enter this “cup” will be deprived of God’s favor.
And Galilee was a place of miracles; and Jesus went out, as he was wont, to turn the water into wine, and to drink water, and to be quiet, and to fill up the nets.
Jesus therefore appeared to his disciples, and then to them, after he had been raised from the dead.
But the most holy thing in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here follow the Path of Grief or the Crossway of Jesus (in Latin - Via Doloroz).
It begins in the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria, where there was a court, and on the streets of the Old Town, it leads to the Temple of the Lord upon Mount Golgotha - the place of the Ascent, the Stone of the Spirit, and the place of Jesus' burial.
Here, then, is the symbolic Christian Pope of the earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be erected where, according to the Christian legend, a tree from which the cross was made for Jesus ’ burial grew.
There is also the most holy place in Jerusalem for the Jews, the Stone of Plač, which was left behind by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people of different denominations are left here with notes of wishes that are then fulfilled.
Make a vertical trip
The ruins of Massada fortress remained a secret refuge from the enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on suspended rocks in the mountains at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And only those who are involved in alpineism can reach their path.
The rest on this historic peak are delivered by the canal.
And in the north of the country, between 1600 and 2040, there is a famous Hermon mountain resort, where in the winter months there is a huge wave of tourists.
He's got a bus shuttle from the foothill.
The overall length of the mountain track is 45 km.
According to ancient tradition, the gods of the language may have lived at the top of the mountains.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You're not going to all of us for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth a visit.
Among them are the Children of Israel's Museum, located not far from Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the oldest Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls found in the caves of the Jewish Desert, and some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It's worth a visit to the Museum of Arts in Tel Aviv.
The exhibition presents a wide range of impressionists and expressionists, Mone, Pissarro, Renoara, Sezanna, Sisley, Matissa, Modiliani, Shagala, Picasso.
Akko can be found in the Al Basha Ban museum, representing several halls of ancient Turkish baths with a crowd of visitors and visitors at that time.
In Caesarea, you must enter the unique Rally Museum, where you can enjoy the sculptures of Dali and Roden.
There are no excursions and souvenir boxes.
Access is free, and donations are not accepted categorically.
The fifth - the Holocaust Museum or the Jad-Vash in Tel Aviv - is one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, the child memorial, is built in memory of 1.5 million children who have been destroyed in the child ' s gas storage and gas chambers.
You're going into it, and you're in absolute darkness.
The stars are dying.
And the names of the Jews' children and the names of the countries in which they died were heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Healing
The three main resorts of Israel are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each has swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and ocean basins.
Interestingly, the Red Sea is bathed even in the winter months, as the water temperature is not below 21 degrees and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and it is bathed for a year.
This is the most unusual sea in the world at the lowest point of the planet at 417 metres below sea level.
The water in it is a waste that is easy to keep in the blue even if it is unable to swim.
It's not really beautiful.
They come here to undergo treatment with salt water, rape, and fungi, and to treat health in dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to bring the nerves in order.
Approaching the Secrets of Ancientness
They are kept by the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffo on the shore of the Mediterranean.
It was followed by the famous Sea route, which unites Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, this is where Noah built his ark, and Persia saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists are very fond of walking on narrow streets, named after the signs of Zodiac.
They're saying if you hit the walls on the street of your sign, Fortuna's gonna be kind.
There are young women coming from all over Israel and even other countries for photo sessions in Jaffo.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can sail through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusades.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the capital city of Judea and the residence of the Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The heavily refurbished theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Tourist on note
By sending to Israel, don't worry about your imperfect English: about 30 per cent of the population know Russian.
Money in the trip is better not in the euro, but in dollars that are easy to exchange on the cheques (now $1 - 3.8 shekels).
City transport is mainly bus, but in Jerusalem there is a speed tram, and in Haife is the only metro in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower Town to the Upper.
In fact, it's an underground funnel.
A tour of all types of urban transport is worth 6 bicycles, which can be resealed for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Nate was observed on the Sabbath by Jewish tradition.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport cease to work.
And on Sundays, from tomorrow, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without garlic and a meal in which milk is compatible with meat.
There is a wide selection of dishes made from bananas and beef, soups and desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish pasta humus, various sauces, malt nuts, fruit and vegetables.
There are no boat dogs on the streets of the cities of Israel.
That's why a lot of fattened balls that just play on their own.
They can be seen in the evening even on the roofs of parked cars.
The ants love human places and do not give up shelters.
The car rental, depending on the brand, ranges from $37 per day (Hyundai Gettz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
In addition to insurance, $15 a day.
And the bike's going to go to 15 checkpoints a day.
The tickets in the museum are on average 30 shekels.
Number in Language
In 2012, over three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the passengers came to the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
In the Earth, between January and October 2012, there were 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, 51 per cent more of the 2010 figure, until the visa was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"Great and possible" will lead to Moscow: migrants digging money in the language
As long as MPs and human rights defenders argue that the law on compulsory language testing has already appeared in the country, counterfeiting certificates
Every year in Moscow, Petersburg and other Russian cities, 13 million gastroes are coming.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkey.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the families left behind.
As from 1 December, the law entered into force that each migrant worker would be required to submit an examination of the Russian language.
While this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the field of services, housing and Communion, housing and retail trade.
In time, however, the FMS promises, tests will become mandatory for all arrivals.
In addition to the language, Russian history and the framework of the legislation will be given.
Knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed both for receipt and for extension of the work permit.
The exception applies only to nationals of countries where the Russian language is a State.
The law does not apply to persons who have been successful in obtaining certificates and diplomas of education prior to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, responsibilities and protection of rights
The network of examinations will work under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute of Puškina, the University of Peoples' Friendship, the IGU, the SBGU and other Russian communities.
Migrant testing will be possible in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
The test initiative was supported by Members of the House and the FMS.
And here are human rights defenders, before the law came into force, many times they were able to ask the press questions: what is that, actually?
What would change the obligation of knowledge of the language for both Russians and the arrivals themselves?
First of all, representatives of the Migration Service are responsible for reducing the number of people suffering from “hard slavery”.
Many are currently talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the Head of the FMS Mission of Russia in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
Protection of their rights should begin before they leave.
Only the organized recruitment system will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90 per cent.
There are problems with migrants without professions, education that do not know the language without medical examination.
Without understanding of the language, - sure Sebelev, - the future migrant is doomed to encounter the infidel people who will help him to take a trip to the narrow narrow bar, where he and his ten likes will be held for months without food and documents, within 12-14 hours of the day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one in their family, and when they arrive they are deceived, they pick up their passports, they don't pay their promised wages," says the Head of Labour Migration of Tajikistan's Tolib Sharipov.
Don't cry, migrating!
However, as long as many citizens of the Central Asian Republic who are seeking employment in Russia are admitted not only to know the language of the country in which they are seeking, but also to write on their own.
Of course, it's not as bad as their fault: a few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajiki can afford even so much primary education.
For their families have something to feed their children, not to wear them properly, wear them, and put them in school.
As a teenager, such children are given the same opportunity to earn.
It's hard if the language is bad, they'll admit it.
"You feel humiliated and worthless."
True, human rights defenders have one important moment in the law.
Tests will only be carried out for migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be neither examination nor subsequent official work.
In the meantime, most of the gastropods continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Well welcome, or the foreign entrance is protected"
Many of the arrivals claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is in bureaucratic references and all the same language difficulties.
Also, legalization is worth 12 to 16,000 rubles.
And this is a fake registration that can be done quickly and in half a thousand.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, no registrations, no cases of extortion.
"A hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," was shared with journalists from Tajikistan, Umed Huschadamov.
"Fly, don't gather, buy a living."
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was found that there were not only migrant registration documents.
Several “lip” certificates for language tests have already been removed by FMS staff.
The sub-printed paper is printed on a regular colour printer.
Of course, they did not provide new owners: each of the migrants, who hoped to facilitate the testing process, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is a two-time formal test procedure: it will be run by a migrant in three thousand.
The main challenge in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that “steps” cannot be simply bought, collected by government representatives and human rights defenders.
As long as the authorities can promise hosters who have failed to pass the test for the first time, the time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian arrivals will be offered in areas that do not involve active contact with people.
MDGs do not market illegal arms
The proportion of offences involving the use of legal weapons is extremely small
Russia's MDGs are proposing to strengthen the law on the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: To blow fires at the weddings when the victims were killed, and the war, which was waged by Moscow's lawyer Dmitri Vinogradov, resulted in seven deaths.
Police want to prohibit the use of trauma in public places and increase the age from 18 to 21.
The idea supported the head of the thought committee on security and anti-corruption of Irina Yarova and promised that amendments to the arms law would be introduced to the House in the near future.
Not all of them are happy that the Russian authorities are trying to combat the problem by "crowding the hooks".
An open letter appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various community-based shooting organizations, were required to give up the “absolute strength”.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, according to the Russian Bureau of the B-bi-si criminalist Vasili Lesnikov.
According to the IMF statistics, 142 firearms were committed in six months 2012 and 1168 thousand crimes were recorded during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the strengthening of civil weapons legislation does not place the offender on the black market.
Now, they say, any weapon at a low price can be found in Moscow.
In the meantime, the MDGs claim that they control the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black arms market is filled with several channels.
The main channels are five, reports Colonel Viktor Baranec, who has worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and Henstab.
Screenshot of a site that accepts arms orders
The first is an army or military trail, that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"Weapons have been covered by Russian officers, and they're the cowards themselves," said Baranec.
The next type of "black weapons" was stolen by criminals from the representatives of the forces.
Baranec explains that both police warehouses have been removed and directly stolen from law enforcement officials.
Illicit stockpiles are sold from military warehouses.
In many military camps, explosions have often occurred.
"There are proven versions that some of the fires have been made especially to cover the absence," said the former soldier.
Baranza says that the arms manufacturers are importing their glue.
"There are now private arms factories that do not maintain competition on the international market and that they extract weapons from the field on the black market, including Moscow," said the expert.
Another "black" market source is a contraband.
In particular, guns and machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's its production, sometimes artistic, and there's a mafia that organized the flow," explains the former military.
Where did the guns come from?
The experts considered what an approximate proportion of each source of illicit arms delivery to the black market.
The report was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Design.
Experts analysed the reporting of MDDs and Rosstat, criminal literature and open data on weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, written by researchers, come from the army and the force departments.
Half of all weapons in the black market have been found there “for the sake of officials whose work is related to weapons”, the report states.
According to the researchers, 17 per cent of arms are from armed conflict sites, 14 per cent are from arms production, and 5 per cent are from black archaeology.
A salesperson in one of the arms stores who asked not to call his name is convinced that no one has ever bought a weapon found by black diggers before - too old.
Most of the time, he says, for a new party, salesmen go to war camp.
A person buys a unit through a gun, such as a TT.
They're writing it down, they're passing it through the locker.
"He carries it to the city and sells 900 euros here for two shops," he says.
"Yes, the police are in the process of all cases, so periodically when a crime disclosure plan is being set up, they are carrying out a check-up of illegal arms from traders," the consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store."
The seller and buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I've been looking at sites on the blogs until a friend who suggested to come to the "God" platform, where there will be a person who will take me to "the corner," where we will trade.
I've only learned the price of the barn there.
Military Observer Victor Baranec
I need someone I know who has a way out, a salesperson tells me I've got a guy like that, but I'm not sure about it.
There are sellers in the markets, but there must also come, on condition, "from Ivan Ivanovic, who asked to pass that the daughter's teeth fell out."
I'm even getting a couple of castes now through a man who's convinced.
He's just putting them on me, too, because he knows I won't give it up.
Newspapers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranec tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he prepared an article on it.
The schematics, he said, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where everything was "everything."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," remembers the soldier.
The buyer, Baranza says, doesn't offer cats in the bag - everything can be tried.
I'm a potential client, I'm not just buying, we're going with a salesman in the woods, we're putting a bag in there.
"I'm given the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm convinced that the weapons are well, we're starting to trade," says the expert's procedure.
Smoking shop
Internet searches include sites and groups in "Intakte", where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
There is no need for documents and personal meetings.
"Enough to have a certain amount of money," they say in the advertising cap on the "Buy a gun or a machine."
It has users leaving their applications and asking questions.
And they're selling to minors?
"Unlicensed of course," asked the user Ivan (orthography preserved).
"Tt.Moscow Cup" is a laconically formulating request for "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has now deployed a huge network of well-established sites that wish to buy weapons of war with shovels.
People go like a hungry fish to feed, and then they get to Siberia on the corner.
Military Observer and former Military Victor Baran
I have heard of such schemes: normally the site is registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer makes a fee through the ATM.
"In response, they send a photograph and instruction, where weapons are hidden," says Dmitri Kislov, a public press secretary.
Victor Baranec argues that by leaving the application on the site, you can remain free of weapons and be left behind.
The Federal Security Service has now deployed a huge network of well-established sites that wish to buy weapons of war with shovels.
"People go like a hungry fish to feed, and then they get the coals in Siberia," he says.
Makeovers for $100
The purchase of illegal small arms, according to expert estimates, could amount to $100 to $900.
According to Dmitria Kislova of the Arms Rights organization, the Macarova gun can be purchased for $100-300.
It'll take a month and a half.
It is disbursed from long-term storage facilities by the management of those medium-sized warehouses.
According to the official statistics of the department, the number of such crimes in general in Russia decreased by 7 per cent compared to January 2011 and by 22.9 per cent, while the number of detected theft and exacerbations of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
In the United States, fast food and supermarkets are based
Work on MacDonald's case leads to the fourth of all American teenagers
In recent days there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart's universities and fast-food restaurants, such as McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendis and Kentucky Fried Chechen.
Until no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave or will be forced into an early stage.
Actions support trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to the increase in modest wages received by several Walmart workers and the fast-food system, the aim of the protestors is to establish trade union organizations in them.
The economic sector is almost unencumbered by trade union movements.
46 cents a year?
The shares started last week, after Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday", when the American economy was disrupted by the cost-effective sales, which captured millions of residents and sometimes accompanied by bribes.
On that day, some Walmart company workers, with 2.2 million people worldwide working, left their jobs and entered the company ' s trade unions and left-wing activists, whose goods are estimated to be of modest and medium-sized size.
Walmart sells everyone in the light, from peaches, hunting roses and car batteries to chickens, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores averaged from 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid Walmart workers are only retired to work.
The availability and assortment of goods made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart may allow itself to sell goods in part because he pays little to his employees.
The latter are also complaining about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of autoloaders or hand scanners.
The participants in the shares in "Black Friday" demanded an increase in wages and pointed out that the amount of medical insurance provided by the corporation jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart employee, who received $9.5 an hour, was not a carnival expense, they said.
Researchers at the University of California in Berkeley show that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 per hour, it will be lost to a corporation of $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1 per cent higher than she's spending on pay now.
If Walmart completely shifts wages to buyers' shoulders, every visit to the store will be at least 46 cents away.
In a year, they'll spend $12,39 more than now.
The Walmart partners have noted enough that protests took place only in nine states and did not cause any minor damage to corporations.
"Black Friday" continued in her shops from 8 o'clock dinner Thursday to midnight the next day, while Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, her cash machines made almost 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
The representative of Dan Fogelman argued in an interview with the left-hand website Huffington Post that the jobs had left a total of "less than five" Walmart staff, and that the protest was the only "special pirate trick" organized by her trade union.
"Free box!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not the Walmart universities (who are not complaining in this progressive city, and therefore not yet here) and McDonalds and other cheap restaurants.
MacDonalds says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals and doesn't pay you for your honest work!
Jumee Williams, a member of the New York Forest
At this point, the minimum wage, under federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.
Restaurants of fast food in time increase it, but unknown, and on average, their number of workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
There's no one in this city who's gonna make less of them.
As there can be money in New York, it's impossible for me.
Once through MacDonalds, there were four American teenagers who had been working for them after school, living with their parents.
Few have seen in this major source of supply or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I'm constantly going to interview McDonald's employees, who complain they have to live for this pay and sometimes even feed children for it.
On the other hand, in the Wall Street Journal forum, a comment is hung, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to produce children if you don't know what you're going to feed them for.
The protesters who started at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonalds on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-feeders start paying at least $15 an hour, which is more than doubled their current minimum salary.
They also required the establishment of trade union organizations in the area of fast-food.
The American law prohibits administrations from preventing and punishing trade union activists with harassment and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it is difficult for a trade union to embrace fast food for objective reasons.
One of the main features is the unusual flow of staff.
Non-conformity
The noise protests took place on that day and in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The summit took place in the middle of a meeting at McDonald's near the Times Square, where several local democrats, including a member of the Jumein Williams forest, said: "Macdonalds says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals and doesn't pay you for your honest work."
The demonstrators also supported other prominent New York democracies, such as a candidate for the mayor of Bill De Blasio, who stated that "we must make a friendly contribution to the support of fast-food workers so that they can obtain a fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!"
As described by the New York Times, this was the biggest action in the history of the American fast food sector.
But there were only a few hundred people involved, but not all of them were workers of a rapid society in which tens of thousands of people were employed in New York.
It's not clear if this spark of mass movement is going to give birth.
"To deceive the brain, it's a medium."
A popular theme for modern technology lovers has recently been adopted mainly through the perception of special points.
In the summer, at its annual conference, the current model showed Google, and then in November it became known that Microsoft also applied for a patent.
However, from the interview with the leader of the 3D interactive technology group in the Cambridge laboratory, Microsoft Sharam Izadi should see that the eye is a step away for the researchers.
Their perspective is to manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, to create virtual open spaces.
- Tell me, please, what's your research team doing?
- We're dealing with human interaction with cars, but we're trying to move the boundaries of this interaction.
While mankind in the mass was stuck in a phase of work with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes rubbing their fingers.
However, we want to look at 5-10 years in advance and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is sold without Kinect, because it's all interestingly bad governance.
- What else is ahead of us?
- Despite Kinect's physical interaction, many are still on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data) and the conclusion is not very yet.
We're trying to change it, we're really working on three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projectives.
We need to put a computer world into our physical world to make it more sensitive.
To do so, however, we need to recognize not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more comfortable form.
And first of all, these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voting?
Popular art, but aren't they reevaluating it?
He certainly cannot be called a panacea - a matter of privacy because he does not always want to tell the environment about his actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each one in his nest.
For example, to manage devices in public places, we had a project that made us think about gestures, but not about masks, but about such expensive, short ones.
It was not the camera, but the hand-held, which fixed the movements of the bones and muscles.
As long as it's large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the manual hours.
But in general, the future for a mixed type of management, for example, a gesture+voice.
- How's that?
For example, how would you ask me to hand you this paper bank?
You'll say and show at the same time.
- I'm usually just saying.
- Oh, it'll be very difficult to recognize.
- Do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine may or may not be able to do at this moment?
- It's absolutely unnecessary, but it's a mutual relationship.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on developing new types of sensors that will allow for more precise identification of human reactions.
These can be laser sensors, for example, they give a bad depth clearance, it's very important.
- If you're talking about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to the modern cameras?
Not enough permits, depths, or anything else?
- In principle, the present generation is what can be removed from our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 k/s.
But it's not in the megapixels itself, it's like a matrix and a depth.
Finally, all the current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds to the work of algorithms designers.
So we need to remember not only the X and Y axis authorization, but also Z.
It's also a very important speed, the number of staff per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s are extremely small, especially for gestures.
Steven Betishes from our Redmond Laboratory made a sensor of a controlled delay of 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between humans and machines.
I'd be very comfortable in my work with the equivalent of such a device, but it doesn't require a relationship to increase the number of staff per second.
- And you don't have to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared trigger, and the other is the receiver of a mirror signal.
And here's the third camera, that's actually the normal sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A potentially larger number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or increase it by increasing the amount of the calculations required.
It would be easy to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the camera's fault and see how that would help in the three-dimensional definition of the situation.
How much I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present her eyes to the audience.
Don't you think that the daily use of the technology of the added reality of the eye is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, always to wander, holding a smartphone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think the coolest option would be a "walking" added reality when you could switch from your eyes to a smartphone, a projection display, and so on.
The eyes are a very personal device, in which their strength (private things you only see), and at the same time the weakness, the added reality based on the eyes will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a minute that the manipulation of virtual golographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the Iron Man, but to just the mortal.
There is one problem that criticism often points to: there is no tactical response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are your group's responses to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the added reality is the seventh in terms of a break in human interaction and the machine.
I think that the eighth could be the addition of tactical sensations.
While one of the interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a self-image floor.
She's making a great record of the shocks!
But there are technologies that are really aimed at adding these "air-carts" to occlusion -- for example, the interference of a few targeted ultrasonic valves at a certain point where there is a finger -- gives a feeling, but as long as it's very weak -- as if you've been sucked into the pancakes.
There are also bracelets on the wrists that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, as well as a promising course.
- Did you try to deceive the brain?
To make him think he feels what he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried to do that yet.
There is another challenge that has to be tackled for a long time -- as to force a person physically in a very limited space to believe that he is going on an open, almost endless path and on the concepts of escape routes (not at all, like clubs) moving platforms, as well as huge layers.
While the brain is being deceived on average, work is still very much for many years.
This is what works on the virtual reality of such attractive to the researcher - many things in an absolutely early stage.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the peterburg Avantard project, which focuses on the citizens who are in advance in the culture and art avantgarde.
In this top list, the bright figures of the Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe by passing on the universal knowledge.
The new "Rosbalt" hero is the epitome artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known as Cyril Miller, a bearded man dressed in all red that meets in the Russian Museum, in the Summer Now, in fashionable tusks and reindeer.
Kiril Miller's paintings always collect audiences wherever they don't show.
Kirill Miller is one of the fundamental socio-philosophic historians of the state who created new mythologies.
Cyril Miller is a bright man from the late '80s to the early '90s.
In addition, he is the man of the city, with his appearance on the streets, who smiles at the city, and lifts all the mood.
He had recently taken a charm and became a peterburg charmer, for he had created for this difficult role all his divine existence, philosophy, and image.
- Kirill, why are you still walking around the city all red, not yellow or red, for example?
- I've chosen a red color as a model of a kind and an image.
In this world, the red color is a compromise between an artist, an imagemaker and a society.
Although everything in society is not serious, it is a cause for aggression and the incitement of bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to a discussion.
- And when did you realize it was supposed to be an artist?
- At the D.C. Nevsky, where my work was shown.
I realized it was my way.
Then the wave of the old free informal artists passed, and the new, free types of me was undetected.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gason girl who led to Puškinska-10, and there was no more wave.
I'm thrown into the theater, clothes, music, all the genres except for words.
And all of this has been brought together in your Art Clinic... and it was important for me to feel at the heart of the culture of Petersburg, where all the best creative forces must be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied the territory in Puškinska-10, and until there was no repair, there was a music and art club, a divine club, a peterburg house.
Many were born there: NOMs, Tequila-Jazs, I remember Schnura taking the project "Echo Van Gogh."
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under the flag, they were in an exciting trick, among them was the modern composer Igor Vddin.
When the group played live, she became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the leader of many pre-Hali-galiv programmes.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and we took him to a big career, and he got us basic education and education.
Gallery D 137, Griboedov Club, it's from Art Clinics.
That's where our workers and they've gone forever.
I'm a yesterday's hero when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the award was "The People of Our City".
In the name of "Journey of the Year" I was named, my culmination ended.
In new times, it's not easy to work on old rules, I'm a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, it can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your job is a familiar way.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a clear sense of relevance and sharpness.
I'll have a program show, the Russian Museum in clowns.
Clooney is an emergency category.
I used to be social, and now it's painful and scary.
But the clowns are getting sick, the tragedy is getting worse.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of peace through totalitarian reincarnation.
Now they're wearing clothes, focusing on external mechanics, not on internal people.
Oh, maybe he can't have his hand and spit in the rose.
And the deception will be eliminated by means of a reindeer.
We recently saw you as a city charmer.
To whom, like me, they are.
- Can commercial art be beautiful, too?
- Commercial art must now be accurate, tactical, sweet.
It's going to deintegrate culture.
People used to fall into a room, a god loved one another, and a god loved the other.
Now it's all broken up into a micro-society, and now it's gonna be hard for everyone to enjoy.
I'm not a hundred-dollar paper so everybody likes it.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult hero has 100 worshipers.
- And Stash Mikhailov's coming for a few thousand!
- He's got a gun on him, and there's a sex-social field working.
And in the cultural field, 300 people will come, and 10,000 will not come, and as a result less management, money, everything will fail.
I have worshipers, chiefly, who don't lie to them, who don't export in vain.
In my youth, I wrote such paintings that one collector had them on the wall next to Falco and Lareon's hangings.
I started with a painting that usually ends.
Now it's often a misunderstanding.
They say: spiritual culture, consumption culture.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, grew up in the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who refused money to paint paintings.
I'm a culture like that.
- Kirill, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
That's the idea: an official of culture.
But not all of them can do culture.
In the case of the right kings, kings may not have understood much in culture, but they understood that they needed to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in Petersburg who might be experts, but they're called because they need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and guide them.
Now it's a delicious flower.
The same is true of Erart, but they are distinguished by the fact that they say that we do not take all the modern art, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What's the matter with you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, much more culture in Moscow, there is soil.
And on our rocks, it's hard to grow.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers now than readers, it's wrong.
There are a lot of interesting people in Europe who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We've got this layer of tuna.
We need to make fashionable art, as it was in the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented by St. Petersburg Grant
Born into Space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with the killer asteroid.
Ships of spaceships with land on board are sent to search for a reserve planet.
In order to preserve mankind, is there a key question about how to continue to produce offspring in a state of ignorance or on the same saving planet?
I think it's a small choice.
In fact, the present planet is only two that can be assumed at least hypothetically.
“This is Venus and Mars” is considered the senior scientific officer of the State Astronomical Institute of P.C. Sternberg (GAISH) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions are more suitable for life on Mars, then on the surface of Venus, the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live on high altitudes or orbits of Venus... in space.
It is a matter of reproduction in space beginning with the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
The four generations of the mountain ravens were nothing different from their earthly varieties.
Then we're going out on the orbit of insectic, crustacean fruit flies.
In 1979, an egg was sent to space to check the embryo’s development in pregnancy.
We're getting a perfectly normal bird out.
And here's the problem.
"The problem that this bird must find resistance must rise to its legs and begin to move," explains the leading laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) RAN Vladimir Sicev.
I didn't find any resistance, the birds were incontrovertible.
In 10 hours, a complete atrophy of the instincts occurred among newborns.
The birds did not respond to light and sound.
And the trouble was that four days later they just died.
"And twice we blew the birds, then we refused, because it was simply impossible to work with them," notes the experiment with birds in the space of Vladimir Sichev.
With animals, the last time a bio-minorist flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
But there will be only one half-persons on the Bion bioboat.
There was a crisis experiment that had already been sent to space with fruit.
In principle, they found nothing supernatural.
"This time it was on the biospheres, but again it's a unique experiment, and such research needs to be carried out," notes Vladimir Sichev.
After the landing of the space cruises, offspring appeared.
But to come to the problem of reproduction directly into space is not yet achieved.
It's a simple task.
Animals, losing their normal habitat, simply cannot achieve their sexual instincts.
But man, unlike animals, in principle, may.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create an emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
But women in space have been flying for 50 years.
The biggest risk was in Teresco.
And the most precious thing humanity has is a female organism.
Our Chika flew, and no one on Earth could say if he'd stay after the flight to space.
If she is willing to have a child after that flight.
"No one has answered this question yet," says the Wachtang Waccandze, a veteran missile and space industry.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight to space, the first female cosmonaut Valentin Terezkov gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child Andrian Nikolaev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, Svetlana Savicka, a second cosmonaut, was born twice in an orbit and even in an open space.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have a lot of space units, and after long flights, it's all gone, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," is the result of the Cosmonaut Flyer, the Hero of the Soviet Union, the Hero of Russia Valerie Polakov.
However, mankind needs to look for some new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, artificial gravity.
The CPC Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory phase of flight preparation.
This is where the cosmonauts work in open space in a zero-floor state.
Water imitates virginity.
If for adult water, let it be comfortable, but still a strange environment, for infants, it's a birthplace.
Small self-reliances seem to confirm that life on the land has come out of the ocean.
There is a connection between having a baby for about 9 months at a mother’s incubator, making it easier for him to get used to the guide.
In principle, this is logical because from the time of birth, from the time of the first bath, only two weeks have passed.
"It's very small to forget something," says the Marine Aksnow's swim instructor.
In a word, if the birth of the unborn child is more natural, a woman needs gravity, the strength of gravity.
Very quickly in the womb the muscles of life, the taza, fall into the ability to produce fruit.
All right, let's get rid of this by relying on birth-stimulators.
Of course, in a special camera, she'll pull him out.
"And what else?" asked Valerie Polakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling earthly tension, the organism does not form a skeleton and a muscle system.
It is not possible for a newborn to wear a special load suit for training as an adult.
He's just going to be deprived of what he's going to need.
"And this experiment that we're going to go to with you, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring a disabled, totally disadapted person to Earth," said the Head of the Committee on Bioethics IMBP RAN Igori Pestov.
Until the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, later on, it will be a reality when the earth on its ships will travel to a distant planet that will become a home for their offspring born in space.
Chief of the Chief Audit Management: Checking the system of fraud has failed on the part of politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the existence of qualitative legislation, remains in its application.
This statement was made by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Chief Audit Office, in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly, which I think is not enough," commented Kala's current situation.
Such findings provide a joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of wrong practices, Peter’s approach to the so-called fraud system led to what is called a fraud.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP (Graditional Democratic Party) would not concern entrepreneurs with checks - is this prohibited or allowed?
“The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of institutions which are obliged to verify and strive for compliance with obligations,” says Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared the public procurement legislation of both countries.
What exactly was this about?
There's a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
It is simply a matter of saying that European legislation affirms how public procurement should be carried out, that national legislation should be followed and then applied in practice.
All the information was collected and, even when it was not yet completed, interesting differences were found - but we could have the legislation "exactly and unequivocally", but in practice we are applying certain parameters to Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to establish more and more detailed rules to focus on the application of the law itself.
And actually, how can this project help you what it means to you?
That is how joint control can contribute to the efforts to halt the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, as this does not lead to a positive outcome.
The economy means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid wealth and possibly criminal conduct.
But it's not the fact that we're going to achieve that by lowering the limit of orders.
Perhaps this system will be filled with bubbles so that those who wish to find a lasagna in this system will find them much easier than if the restriction had not been reduced.
You are talking about internal problems in the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the German control system work?
Is there an organization like our CIA (Control and Audit) or is it working otherwise?
As for institutions, there is also a college that works slightly differently, but mainly both institutions operate similarly.
In addition, the powers to a certain extent are similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and federal land units - their system differs slightly from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have government funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Courts.
With regard to local legislation, just what do we have?
In fact, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it cannot be said that it is the best in all.
Is that because they're better at controlling?
No, definitely not, but I repeat, I don't like these comparisons.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't benefit from cooperation with our office, would they?
When it comes to domestic legislation, how did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act affect your institution, in some way?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it has not yet appeared in our control work.
Since we are monitoring the facts, some delays need to be taken into account.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future checks - we have started using our new tool "to detect the risk of inequality", through which we have missed almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them, and of course these changes will occur because restrictions are changing, changing the conditions of some types of tenders and so on.
Do you think that the adoption of this law would bring benefits or additional burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules “will get worse” and will not be complied with.
In the operation of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes, to the regional council) that any non-compliance with the State Procurement Act entails a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is that the way to strengthen the law in such a way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who wish to take and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system will only create even more pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this situation?
Let's be aware that this path will not lead anywhere.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the GDP will not concern entrepreneurs with the inspections of the so-called fraud system.
"Swartz System" prohibited or permitted?
The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of the bodies which are obliged to verify and strive for the fulfilment of obligations.
We can say, "We change this law and let it go," but we can't say that we're going to pretend nothing's going on.
The Public Procurement Act contains a rather strict rule as it should be formally implemented, and that is correct, which protects public procurement.
On the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly, which I think is not enough for us.
The roads are rocky, but mostly passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snowy.
They're basically passing, but they're somewhere more careful.
Carlovar ' s border
This morning in Karlovar County, the roads were passing, but somehow frozen and snowy.
The temperature dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but the temperature should be reduced during the day.
The snowfall in the region ended only in the lows.
However, on the hills of the Red Mountains is about 30 centimeters [30 cm] of snow.
From the information received from the local road workers, it was known that the places were less visible because of the fog.
The R6 high-speed and first-class road in the region is now underway without restrictions.
However, attention needs to be paid, for example, to bridges where the surface may be freezing and rocky.
All roads relating to the second and third classes, including mountain trails, are also accessible.
But in some of their areas, the remains of the frozen and the snowy areas are still in place.
Particular attention should be paid to the roads at the heights.
Paradubic and Royal Landing
The management of Czech roads and highways on its websites informs us that some roads in eastern Czech Republic are threatened by ice, while on the high roads and high roads there may be a snowy layer.
Regional road workers warn drivers of famine, which can be trained especially at the heights of the Pardubic coast.
Gololed can be around Lanskroun, Usty-on-Orlici, Polički, Switavi or High-Mito, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
The routes I/43 and I/34 located in Switzerland are treated by chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of the Giant Mountains and the Orlick Mountains.
The snowy layer is on the roads at the heights of Rihnova-sur-Kneža and Trutnova.
In eastern Czech Republic today, there is a changing cloud with no precipitation.
The temperature usually varies from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, a light wind.
Pulsenian border
The roads in the Plzeň region pass this morning, but places need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
In the morning, the temperature fluctuates from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places, there may be a cold.
Drivers may encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
Regional road workers provided information.
Shosse D5 is now passing virtually without restrictions, but expensive managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most of the first class roads have a dry and moderate surface.
In southern Plsna and Tahove, the frozen areas can be found.
The second and third class roads are wet, and in this case there is also a warning about the possibility of rolling sites.
Leaders must be cautious, especially on few roads used in the Shumawa area.
Olomoucle
Leaders on the high side of the Olomouccan coast must today take into account snowflakes on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Red Sea and on the road towards the Videl Cross.
On the night of the snowfall, the road workers, according to information from the road management, dropped about three centimeters [3 cm] of snow in Shumpperca.
In other parts of the road, there are usually no restrictions.
"On the heights of the Shumpper are the remains of the snow.
The leaders on the side of Esenika must bear in mind the presence of a snowflake in the Red Sea," ČAN (Czech News Agency) said today.
On the night of the road, their colleagues from Essenika went out, convinced them that the roads were bare and wet after the chemical treatment.
In Olomouce, roads are unrestricted, but in Sternberg, drivers must be careful at forest sites where moisture remains.
Ossetian coast, Liberian coast
In the morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that a few difficult places remain.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several ice-cold or falling snow spots, the mountain road is closed at the Telnica station in the Usteck region.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lows, so snow and ice remain on the roads. In the lowlands, especially in the south-east of the Czech Republic, there are no problems, roads are mostly dry.
The roadside difficulties are not yet reported.
Road workers report the rise of hunger in the county of Steta.
Meteorologists say that the ideal conditions for his education were created at night: the rain and the shadow of snow all day long, the sky brightened and the freezing began at night.
The adverse conditions are reported on the main roads and on track I/13 on the coast of Usteck and Liberia.
Because of the snowy layer of trees related to the road itself, they were forced to close the road in Telnica at the Knica.
Simon Ornest: At concerts we want to build positive energy
How do you feel that less than a month later the end of the world should come?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we people are so easy to look at.
Together with The Tap Tap Group, we are constantly staring at this topic and saying that we are the only group in the world that can collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give an absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Would you please tell the readers more about this?
This is a national fundraising event that we have planned for two years.
We have decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the May calendar, which was announced at 11:10 on 21 December.
On the day before that event, three concerts are held in Prague, Brno and Ostrava in parallel on 20 December at 21:00.
They're going to end, rudely speaking, at a time when the May calendar will be completed on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, the time zone of which will be 12 hours earlier than we have.
Who's got that idea in his head?
That was my idea, and we've all been thinking about it together with our artist González August.
In addition to the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about how we will ever hand this world over to our children.
In the event of the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, shoes, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These items can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz and thus provide support.
The Tap Tap Group, along with other musicians, also performed a humn against the end of the light, which is called the end of the light.
Will your favorite YouTube audiences sound good at these concerts?
Of course, in the end, if the end of the world is to come and the end of the world is not coming.
It will be held by all performers at all concerts at the same time.
Gymnasium will also sound in the direct air of Czech television.
The words to this song were written and played by Jesus in the clip of Thomas Ghana, also participating in the performance of Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also cooperate with other people in Czech cultural life, as we conduct many charity activities and concerts.
We are trying to actively link them to these projects.
It turns out that a lot of people like to work with us, they're interested.
What's going to happen at the concert against the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for the STUDEO wireless educational centre, for the sixth year we've been working with a civil association of Tap at the Edlikka Institute.
Teachers regularly visit students at the Edlikka Institute and perform fun and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we are trying to give them this opportunity.
As part of the project for the further construction of the Edlikka Institute, a separate building will emerge in the future, to which we will move with the project.
Several music groups and performers will be held at each concert.
What were the criteria for selection?
We have sought to establish a programme that interests all generations, including children.
For example, there are Chinese, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere and Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irži Suhi in Prague.
Both details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “magnificent activities” in the future?
In May, we will be the first to attend the Prague Spring Festival, and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
The following year, we would be pleased to have a presentation at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we were in the United States, would like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
In view of your serious plans, you have already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with limited capabilities.
How do you deal with the cost of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it looks at first.
We have five participants in electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs should travel in the luggage room, plus a large number of trucks and boxes with tools.
The Czech ČSA and British Airways have always been excellently prepared for us, and I have been surprised to see how many times I have been surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we just got back, everything went smoothly.
With travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public relations with persons with disabilities and so on.
What have you been up to now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do, we in Russia have witnessed that in the east we are still at the base level.
Compared to Prague in Moscow, there are many barriers, and there is still a self-defence in the wild in an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
Also, there is no such thing as walking the path of the disabled in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with limited opportunities.
What, on the contrary, should we always reach out to the best countries?
There's a lot of stuff, the level of performance that's far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's perfectly normal that people with a severe form of disability go to the streets alone, can go to the bathroom, the museum, wherever they want...
It is not very common that a large number of people with limited opportunities are actively involved in public life, and in this we are a little overrun with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or freedom of the public is one thing, but when famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers appear among us, everything will really change.
As long as it's a single case, it's people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is now very popular, but let's go back two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I went to the Edlicha Institute as an educator, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician myself, and I'm also playing on the saxophone, I've organized an interesting music circle with my colleague.
Well, in time, as our leader, Lady Angelovic, says, it's a little out of control.
But the popularity has come only in recent years, or am I on a path?
This is true, it has helped us to join the famous singers and to work actively on the group's propaganda.
We have come to the conclusion that the work that no one can assess is essentially as if it did not exist.
Through the means of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you have the goal of breaking The Tap Tap so well?
From the beginning, I felt their potential to do something unusual.
In the show business, it's full of things that reflect each other.
That's logical, everything is taken with caution, and it's been a long time.
There are very few things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us, of course, is of course...
But this grief is quite excessive, because people with limited opportunities are not some suffering and all the abandoned persons we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities get something, it's not just for them, it's for society as a whole.
Has the success of being a strict leader been achieved by what many consider to be yours?
If we want to do our work qualitatively, we must be in a lot of troublesome things and have some discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and fly in the clouds, and when they know that twice a week they have to go to rehearsals, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose their enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's how it happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
The Tap Tap is currently a group of twenty people.
How many were there in early 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, that's impossible to prevent.
For those who have will and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place on the day before the expected end of the light, on Thursday, 20.12.2012, at 2 p.m.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno, at the Fléda and Ostrave Club, in the centre of Plynoj with 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are joined by a telemost on the performance of The Tap Tap "The End of the Light" group.
The aim of the project is to raise funds of SEK 25 million for the purchase of multifunctional wireless equipment for the educational centre STUDEO at the Institute of Edlikka in Prague.
The ticket is 400 kroner for children under 12 years of age free of charge. Tickets can be purchased in advance in Bohemiaicket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as a second country of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ECA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ECA in 1994 and participated actively in a number of Agency projects over the years.
But the way to the cosmos of Poland began a long time ago.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts traveled to space, but this did not always meet with understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture A. Sternfeld, which on 6 December 1933 presented to the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory the idea of his innovative work "Introduction to Cosmonautique".
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience with an equal heart, and after several years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won Robert Esno-Peltri and Andre Luis Hirsch's "Introduction to Cosmonautique".
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a major advocate of astronomy and cosmonautique.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
The Chadomian became known as a world advocate of cosmonautism, and his contribution was assessed, including that one of the craters on the other side of the Moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925, a railway vehicle equipped with a rocket engine was built in Poland.
Regrettably, the author of the idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear that a missile should have been used for the decommissioning or braking of the body.
Information on this site is only known from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery has begun to think about rockets.
The study was conducted by the Arms Technology Section, in cooperation with Professors Michislav Wolfe and Gustav Mozzicki.
The remaining materials show that the studies have reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of the German forces, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, a special press released the idea of a photo-electric missile by Rogosinski and the following year, the work of the "Air Torpedo and Aviation Bomb" by the author, Leviva-Kzjoblockko, was released.
Both projects have been developed for the military use of missile engines.
Prior to the war itself, all projects of military use of missile technology were undertaken by the Temporary Scientific and Advisory Committee (Timely Adradczo-Naukowy) which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work, the work was completed as a result of the beginning of the war.
The next scientific work on cosmonautique appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautique Society (Polish Association of Astronautique).
For the first time, the issue of society was mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the “Problems” magazine, which published four large articles on astronomy.
In one of them, Professor M. Sobotovic proposed to organize a society that would deal with spacecraft.
At the time, the projects of artificial satellites were already under way, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronomical Society (POA) has tried to enter the international astronomical federation (based in 1951) and has already become a member of the APO in autumn.
And next year, the first President of POA Kazimež Zarankevic (1902 - 1959) became Vice President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in that post until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, POA has made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which has become the first Polish rocket to conduct a scientific study.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first started on 10 October 1958.
The rocket capable of overcoming the distance of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
An improved version of RM-1A was subsequently built, and two-stage RM-2 rocket tests were conducted in the Bledwood Desert in 1959.
The rocket was about 1.4 m long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already capable of carrying out the current scientific work - the RM-34 missile could exceed 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high winds.
But further development was suspended in 1962.
The first RM-type successor was the Meteor-1 missile, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-step, its total length was 510 cm and the initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (known as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed, which differ in the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had an area of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B - 0.34 litres, and Meteor-1C - 0.62 litres.
The maximum length of the flight in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 missile was developed at the Aviation Institute and its first summer tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with an initial weight of 380 kg was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
Then the Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR ( Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
In addition, within the framework of the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space research on Soviet artistic satellites, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaschevski became the second intercosmonate after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Law on Public Works.
The decision sparked a lively discussion in society.
It would certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multidimensional, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This relates to the principle of free trade and to the free, unrestricted movement of private capital along with unsecured financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the value of the labour force (wage) there is a price tension.
This concept needs to be understood when the manufacturer, through the delivery of the cheap goods, tries to withstand economic competition by the fact that the value of the competitor is “abstaining” in order to take up most of the market and thus increase its own income.
This means, on a large scale, for the majority of entrepreneurs, either the transfer of production abroad, or the purchase of cheap goods abroad, or the disappearance of goods, resulting in increased unemployment in countries where the value of labour is higher than in others.
Since private capital has no social responsibility, including for its unemployment, the inevitable costs of the State for social needs are increasing.
Overall, the situation is exacerbated by the unwillingness of employers to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the social and economic damage they suffer in the pursuit of profits.
The situation is so well known that no specific statistical data should be provided.
Non-ceremony of private capital practices create at the level of the economies of individual States where Governments of countries are forced to compete with each other to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, Governments are giving their own population a lease of private capital, despite social decline.
This is reflected primarily in changes in existing legislation.
The aim is to make its people economically subject to the dictatorship of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment while at the same time serving as a tool for cutting workers ' rights in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty is increasing, and the difference between the poor and the rich is growing.
For several years there has been a public distribution of poor products in the GFR that are unable to feed themselves with their own work.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
As a result of increasing the competitiveness of the German economies, there are always cases where employed people receive such wages that they must be paid by the State to obtain a minimum of living.
A similar scandal has also been reported to the public in the case of additional Bundestag workers.
Economic measures in almost all southern EU States undoubtedly result in the same situation as people under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in social status, either forced to migrate, as in the 19th century, or to be paid for indemnities in society, hoping that a private investment capital will ever come into the country.
But where does he come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will be shifted from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians, Africans are still working for European wages.
This is true of all Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim that the State cannot participate in ownership, that the management economy is leading to an economic catastrophe.
The private capital insists that the State should not be involved in the economy by administering actions.
Should we further answer the question whether private capital, which is now in the process of managing policies and, above all, the entire State, is in its own selfish interests?
The only answer is yes.
Evidence is the existence of almost omnipotent and omnipotent lobbying in all States.
As a result, we have a pointless situation in corruption, mutual benefit, legislation where almost everything deserves punishment, but it is not a crime.
In the FRG, the situation is that the government ministries, due to the lack of funding, have been entrusted with the development of draft laws to private legal firms that are closely related to industry.
These bills then approved the Bundestag.
All power is not from the people, as the Western Constitution states, but from financial-power groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal democracy is now rapidly under way, as described by Appian in the “Cesar and Pompey Crisis of the Roman Empire”: “The State has long been disbanded, and the institutions are engaged in violence.
Takeovers, illegal receipt of mercy by means of stones and swords.
Encouraging and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to the election with an earlier vote"...the ordinary people did not at all interfere with the office of governor, at the end of one day the State remained without a consulate for eight months.. .. .. "Serious began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is the self-government and the need for the choice of an energy man.". Appian thought it would be Pompey, but he became Caesar, who had finally changed democracy into self-government.
As in ancient times, today’s society has its own unreasonable interests without taking into account public interests.
Private capital is not, in fact, intended for public use.
The present result is not different from the past: the improper decline of the elite without any effort to carry out reforms of a deeper nature.
That is why the fascist and communist regimes have emerged, and we must seek to liberalize the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain break, followed by the next round.
Above all, it is tragic that the present elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of future victims, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are now seeing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a decision or, at least, not always.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the State ' s participation in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the State, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Experiencing Laboratory.
"There will be nothing out of violence, and there will never be a way out" is Sting, the song "Hrunky," where the main text of the refrehensive is, "We don't forget what we are."
"If my sons didn't want a war, they wouldn't be "the dying Gutel Schnaper, the wife of Meera Amschel Rothschild.
The last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, caused many reactions.
Some speak for Israel by arguing that it has the right to self-defence, while the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support Palestinians by arguing that Israeli State racism, the genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist State.
I don't want to think about who in these periodic repeated murders - a criminal, and who, at the end of the day, Israeli citizens, including self-government territories, were born at the moment of the current political situation, and who were not witnesses of the beginning of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to take a look at the entertainment, to look at who has been serving for the past 95 years (regarding the signing of the Balfur Declaration in November 1917) in a small area of the Middle East.
Some of my discussions are supported by historical facts, some of which are based on my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of fighting for power.
In each age, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps in a completely independent way, or whether they have been followed by someone who has guided their actions to the pre-destined goals.
We should be allowed to live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of several people, and that the concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred for the life of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families there is one that could be viewed as the head of the spleen (I don't know if anyone is standing over them, but that's not going to work out) - Rothschild.
You don't write much about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) has been bought in the 1990s to stop hearings linking them to criminal acts in the higher spheres in which they were, and which have always led to strengthening their power, increasing wealth or at the same time and at the same time, and to others.
They have large stock packages in almost all central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their share, hold or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the invasion of Cadafi there were only four, but at the same time the Russian Government took the central bank of its country into its hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of the central bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, and during the civil war he began to issue his own (understanding - government) money and was killed in the theater in 1865.
John F. Kennedy began to issue his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (Federal Reserve System), was killed in 1963. Deputies Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to bring the FED to court for the dissolution of the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their desire for world power from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of a plan of three world wars, established by the 33rd-level Mason, Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was the destruction of the monarchy States in Europe, the second had to destroy colonial domination, especially Britain, and the third had to bring down the world population to about 0.5-1 billion people (a number of slaves will be sufficient for their comfort and prosperity, and they would not need many resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and the ultimate acceptance of absolute authority.
The method used by the group of the richest families in the head with the Rothschilds is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent proposal of solutions (order ab chao - order of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the EDF, which had to prevent the recurrence of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to unravel World War I through the murder of the Habsburg heir to the Austrian Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Royal Russia, beginning the multi-wisdom revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly, unwarranted in the military and economic respect of the capitalization of Germany (there was no need for war to destroy the royal Russia) and, as a result, the Central European Power, Austria, was fragmented.
In order to facilitate the deployment of World War II, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation by imposing huge military repairs on Germany, rather than creating a prerequisite for the radicalization of the depleted masses, and then it was only left to urge Germans to be strong enough to blame the leaders and offer simple solutions, to further create a multi-national Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed to play the function of the fifth pillar in the fire of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschildi provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one of which sought to establish a Jewish State, preferably in the area of historical Judah and Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfur declaration provided a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, beginning the first clash with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks have taken place on both sides.
The Second World War was raging, it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had been expelled from the ranks where he was originally held by the bankers, or all he had done was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created conditions for the recognition of the Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, as Germany was driven by military repairs to the Second World War, the State of Israel was declared to be a means of creating a vision for the third war.
If the international bankers can untie it, the Jewish people, as in the second world war, will be the victim of the war on the front, now with the Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of disunity and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (to take only a sharp division of people against Israel's opponents and opponents).
Who is to blame, and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where the insult is the result of an endless series of violence if it all begins with the desire of individuals and their desire for the world power?
There is a need to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we do, international bankers are pushing people to vote in elections solely by their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international banker who is doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan) will threaten to become a global conflict, and taking into account Iran's control over the Ormous River, which contains 20 per cent of all world oil stocks (the sea corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a common crisis, and people will accept a new world order."
The new world order in their presentation is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serve a harsh financial aristocracy that enjoys comfort.
A world where each birthing organism is implanted by a chip with which it becomes a material under total control.
"And compels all small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves to have on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast, or by the number of his name, cannot buy nor sell.
Here is wisdom. Anyone with intelligence can calculate the number of animals.
Because it corresponds to the human name, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
"Operation Argo": When something's wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamic Protestant students seized the United States Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats into hostages.
They had to be released in exchange for Mohammed Reza Pehlevi, a fugitive after the U.S. revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
The U.S. administration did not expect a positive outcome - it was unable to allow itself to throw the chess on board because it could undermine the trust of the allies in other countries.
However, to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not in a position to do so.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a unsuccessful attempt to free hostages from power.
The diplomats were finally released 444 days later, after negotiations with the Government of Algeria.
Their fate caused the house to be filled with solidarity and anti - Iran.
The defeat in Iran greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter at the 1980 presidential elections, which ended with Ronald Reagan.
The film by the actor Ben Afflém "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought small victories to America.
Soon before the occupation of the Embassy, six workers were able to escape.
After difficult circumstances, they completed their journey to the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, with the help of an extravagant cover legend that they had gone through Canadian passports as members of a semantic group searching for a place in the country for a science and fantasy era.
Grouping of genres
The plan that invented an evacuation expert, Tony Mendez, demanded the cooperation of Hollywood.
In order to be reliable, specialized journals wrote about the film project, held press conferences, and the proposed production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept in secret for a long time, a film based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflek's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political triller, called a movie-cinoops, a story of a good secret, the affair - perhaps a number of movies about the friends of Ouchen.
The film constantly changes the moods - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (the headlines show signs of historical events and how the same situations were shown in the film - there are no major differences in that).
On the other hand, light-headed Hollywood cuts that cross with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions, the men in the costumes are discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, on the stairs of the institutions, on the phone...
Ben Afflek has been able to make a career start.
From a derogatory actor, he became a respected director, and his game ceased to be the object of laughter.
Operation Argo his third full-meter film, after the dark detective "Forgive, child, forgive" (2007) and the Troller "Gorod" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film of Aflek, which is not recorded in the home town of director Boston.
The feeling of the local atmosphere is related to the qualities that promoted earlier filmmakers over the Hollywood standard.
And Afflek shows it in Argo, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of real events, the introductory scenes of the fall of the Embassy impress with their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when history suddenly changes.
The effect of Aflek and his colleagues is similar in the scene of the imaginary (partial headquarters in the Tehran base).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative did not imply a number of cinematographic scenes.
He's working quite successfully with this little, sometimes something he's thinking -- it's not so elegant out there (the scene in which the phone call in America prevents an overcrowding crisis at Tegeran airport, and the chase on the high-land field looks pretty clever).
Argo is a lack of dissatisfaction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues are indeed very promising, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are not the only ones in the film.
The Afléka film is not enough dramatism, it is a film that can be viewed with moderate interest, assessing the situation and the retro-style that re-establishes the seven-year-old triller.
But he's busy.
This, however, is enough for a reminder of one, still in a familiar sense of living history, as well as for evidence of the exaggerated perceptions of all-powerful and all-knowing specialized services.
Airplanes, bananas and circuses
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual survey of the most absurd banking collections, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd order or project from the EU."
"We have been encouraged by this latest event, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women in the administration of large European companies," said author Patrick Nager.
Among those already nominated for absurdities is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unite the rate of insurance contributions for men and women.
To date, women have had opportunities for life insurance because they are at a lower risk for insurance companies.
"The following incredible ideas from the EU's master can be presented to the competition by the end of this year.
The vote alone will take place by the end of February 2013," Nager said.
The EU's contested orders include, for example, the mandatory addition of biofuels to fuel, which causes damage to nature, as well as the prohibition on the use of reliable mercury gradients only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or a directive on the size of the chicken cell, which has resulted in substantial travel of eggs this year.
Critics have also been banned from using the term “buterbrown oil” or from selling classical lamps.
Quality bananas shall be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often acts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by a State or a group of States (the Czech Republic is now even under the threat of a vow to its banks).
The interests of the lobby are: for example, the top quality bananas in the European Union should have reached a length of 14 cm and should not have been "anomalous".
However, the European Commission was justified in harmonizing only the existing different national rules that made trade more difficult.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, has, however, softened the standards for fruit and vegetables, recalling that existing directives will lead to a waste of products.
The candidate for victory in the survey may also become a more recent EU decision that the air-sellers must be provided with a warning that children under eight years of age cannot push them without adult care.
The EU has referred to American studies that the air bubbles in the game are the potential cause of the death of children by drowning.
Such a restriction now applies to children under the age of 14 who are not allowed to go to jail.
Fun ideas are born at home
It is also absurd to rule on the European officials themselves: everyone who holds an official position in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia, taking into account the delicacy of the subject for Greece, and should instead speak "BURM" (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com portal, in cooperation with the association of liberal economies, Laissez Fair, proposed a vote, in addition to several of the above-mentioned absurd rules, such as the EU rule on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has established the maximum quantity of food stocks that may be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.
The Czech Republic subsequently exceeded, for example, the quantities of preserved mushrooms, which threatened her with a large fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for lack of sea and the idea of granting subsidies to a grant application.
But these ideas came up in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We're in a disadvantage because we don't have the sea.
We will ask for compensation from the European Union," said Mr. Jaroslav Palas, then Minister of Agriculture, in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that there was a high crop of grain in the country, and as a result of so-called intervention procurement, the State had full stockpiles that had to be exported.
Because the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission visited the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Grants for grant were proposed by the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by the Minister for the German Republic (US-DEU), in particular, such grants were to be made for a grant application from Brussels.
EU: Amazing orders are an exception
While decisions in Member States are easily criticised, the EU's regulatory efforts, as well as the more effective functioning and development of the European Union, in the opinion of many experts, deserve greater recognition.
In the opinion of the experts, it is a serious problem to make EU grants to projects that do not even have any intention of deepening European integration, but which Member States have achieved in the discussion of the budget.
The Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, as well as in other countries of the European Union, and it does not always win the competition.
Although after six years of fighting with Germans and Austrians, the name "Olomoutic Acids" was preserved, but "Tuzeme Roman", whose traditions were rooted in our country in the 19th century, our producers had to be renamed "Tuzemak".
The name of the rome may be limited to the products of the pancreatic distillate, not of the sugarcane.
In the official list of registered EU products, along with world-famous "feta" and "gorgondzola", a marzipan from the German Länder or Parma vegetables, there have already been, for example, carlovars, peas and peacocks and jasmines.
The EU's trade mark can also be proud of the pardubic spring and bitter tubers.
People want me to keep the republic, but I'm a lover, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man come to the head to be a president?
I don't think about becoming a senator or president.
If we had all worked out in the country, I wouldn't be in trouble.
But I can't see how in the last 20 years the country has been developing, how the holes are going, people are raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution to it.
And since I've been in my 40 ’ s and I'm an independent person who doesn't belong to any party, I have no other way to influence things than to be a senator or president.
You fell into the Senate, but you were soon sent to the Presidential Palace.
Will you not then return to the people who have chosen you?
I have always said that I will be involved in the fight for the presidential castle, depending on the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later, I made it clear that if I was elected a senator, I'd be in the president's office.
My goal is not a post, a post is a tool that I can use to carry out my views.
That is why I need the most influence and the most extensive powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we're a nation slave in our own bar or TV, but that we're willing to melt everyone who's trying to change something.
This is added to the media that black people and that distort freedom of speech with the freedom of the lie.
For example, I was told that I'm giving a reception to the journalists, or that I was a advisor to Irja Paroubeka.
Let's go to your views.
You have begun the fight for the presidential castle with statements about the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the reverse of the property statements of more than twenty million.
To achieve this, the law needs to be amended.
You have no such authority as President, and only a whole Senate can propose laws.
How would you like to do that?
When I, as a citizen, lobbyed for excursions to become a free enterprise, it was possible to move forward.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good offer to the left or the right, he is deliberately obstructed, and that prevents citizens.
As an independent single person, I have much greater potential for support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can and will apply to each party what is best for our country without having a party on the stakes, without having to look at the dogmas.
Do you think of yourself as being more relevant to the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, I think people are more like me to the left.
It doesn't matter to me, a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It's not that someone is related to the right, but someone to the left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good solution for society, whether it will be offered by the CPCM or the GDP, and I will be against the wrong idea.
You get angry when someone says you're popular.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to do.
It can be called populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world, or they are spoken by prominent experts.
But without Parliament's support, you'll only have to lie.
And that's why you won't be in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to carry out your criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another chance.
Just convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to turn them on our side so that we can achieve our own.
If I had been elected president, it would not have been a problem to organize a direct television broadcast, in which I would appeal to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate the material and criminal liability of politicians, public servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they don't, they'll have to report why they don't want it.
If there is a strong person who will sound abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on a political scene.
Take the President's direct election - it was a public pressure.
I'm just saying I'm a lover, not a genius, not an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies to resist my beliefs and views.
I am only a political leader, and for my programme I am trying to get the support of the majority.
I am trying to move on my own; in case this fails, I will end up in six years and return to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura's supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that I'm not doing anything by myself, so I've been visiting a number of famous people with a proposal to join the Senate.
I went to Radi Janchure, he refused to do much work.
I also supported at least the leading investigation by journalist Jan Laurentzov, who exposed fraud with light fuel products.
I put out my candidacy because people are really unhappy, but now I feel like I'm on my own.
Sixty per cent of the people did not vote, but the majority of those who had elected representatives of the institution.
Only two of us are independent in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate so that changes will be made with difficulty.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my views, such as the direct election of mayors and governors.
You think about the reason for your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the purity of the past of every potential proponent, and I don't have the money.
There's no money on the presidential campaign, only twenty thousand crowns on my transparent account.
You don't have the money?
You're talking about property declarations, and how do you deal with it?
Personal property is estimated to be approximately 60 million.
I have an area in Prague worth about 25 million, 10 million apartment, another 8 million apartment, an art collection of approximately 10 million, Aston Martin at 3.5 million and Skoda Superb at a million, and a few million on account.
As for Aston-Martin, I came up because it was my little dream - I always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, was gallant with women, and at the same time fought against dishonesty and lawlessness.
You're driving to Aston Martin, you own 60 million property, and you don't have any money on the campaign?
You're saying you want to change the republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million on the campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for a pre-election campaign from my dress.
The campaign costs me, in fact, a senator's salary.
But I wouldn't live with that money, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't have gotten into it.
So you're going to keep doing business so you can live?
Did you not say that you would reduce this activity?
But it doesn't depend on the size of the pay.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, the director of the tourism agency will be my deputy in the spring.
People would like me to be a silversmith who will keep the republic.
But I also need to live for something.
How much, as an entrepreneur, did you get used to it every month?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, that's what I get.
And if I were to be president, I'd finish my business.
You'll find a full interview on Saturday's issue of the "Right" newspaper.
MVRDV architects prove that these adventures are not only imaginary - for example, Speikenisse and his recently built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"I think this building is fun, it looks futuristic, and finally we can see something interesting again," says Lizette Verhaig, walking on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in the vicinity of a large company, thinks, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself, why do we have another library today?
Everyone has Internet, iPad and electronic books.
Now no one's volunteering in such old-fashioned libraries, right?
Speikenis, a small, sleepy town under Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
A few years ago, it was decided to contribute to common education and build seven imaginary bridges, which are represented in euro banknotes, in the form of beautifully decorated iron-beneficial miniatures.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city’s fathers realized that they had the only way to resist the statistics: to build a library here!
The wines of Maas from the rotterdam architectural office MVRDV, the master of bold column charts and the author of bold, sometimes even cynic constructions, dealt with the challenge of his normal incompetence and appeared at a competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under the mouse and the perversion of the face.
And while the jury's members looked at and ate with their shoulders, the tough Maas put out of his original pyramid gift and concluded his project's defense by saying, "Dear citizens!"
Here's my proposal: "The Book Mountain" in Spakeniss, so-called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain amounted to 30 million euros.
It is part of the project of revitalization, which also includes a underground garage, supermarket, mail and several residential houses and taunhauses of a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Book Mountain was awarded the second award of the 2012 Lucerne Library of the Netherlands.
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch National Wooden Building Competition.
Thus, a walled courtyard that could not offer anything before, apart from the postmodern pedestrian zone and an amazingly unpretentious rat, whose white facades suggest a milk factory, has become richer for a modern construction of architecture.
But the main thing is that in Spain the first public building of cultural destination appeared in the history of the city.
A Long Path to a Book
First impression: the book Eldorado under the cheese cup.
There is only one elevator in the center of the mountain massif, because the present worshipers of architecture and reading would prefer to study this location by foot.
From all sides, the room is bright and easy to see, the fields of the godless huddle and elegant street bells create a sense of public urban space.
The city environment is restored perfectly.
Look at the girls, boys and girls who play football.
And everywhere is books, books, books.
"The bookmakers are usually standing by the facades, and there is a large dark hall in the middle, usually inconvenient and intimidating," says Vini Maas.
We put a classic configuration of the space from the foot to the head and pulled out the area to read inside.
The interior area of the Book Mountain has been well used: the centre has offices, Internet libraries, chess clubs, environmental centres and technical facilities.
In particular, black bookmakers who serve as walls and parapets, as well as step - stone pearls, are particularly happy.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even experienced architects and construction engineers are lost in suspicion, which is unknown material.
"We tried to work with secondary materials," explains Jop Trauborst, project manager representing the Speikenisse community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once on a farm in Frisland, we met the right side product of agriculture.
For many years in the warms and fields in the Netherlands, the artificial fibre material of a millimetre thickness has been used as a base under the roots.
It's cheap and saves time.
A ton textile serves one or two seasons, then it can be removed.
For the library, it was a canvas - for the first time in those volumes - pressed in a four - inch - thick panel.
Under the heat and pressure, the so-called Landbauplastics (CLP) is turned into a dark, uniform, durable material, with the smell of a little new car and a little cross-section.
There's 105 degrees to the top.
Those who cross the road nearly 500 meters long will be rewarded in literary coffee not only with a fantastic view of the city but also with Dutch croquets and wooden figurines in the hills.
They are concerned about the atmosphere, and primarily about the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Costs for New Soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is a model eco-design," Troubrest says.
The heat of the ground is used for heating and cooling.
Although the Book Mountain stands under a glass cup, even in the bright days of the sun, it is only for a short time.
Widely ground wooded farms, which are perpendicular to glass facades, provide shade and take on a large portion of the sun.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided with fully automatic wheelchairs.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned earlier, has already visited a new library.
Lizette Verhaigh was here, too.
And also a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogard, who called Bukenberg "the soul of Spakeniss, which has long been unremitting."
Reason: A few weeks before the opening of the book, each person received an invitation to offer a book from his own congregation.
These books were to be occupied in empty places in the fields of the non-complete library - at that time there were 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The poles are placed on top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-storey library," says architect Vinny Maas.
"I think that our invitation now makes every resident somehow relate to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if she serves only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV has been able to solve a royal task, which is called the establishment of identity in the professional garage.
Spakeniss wrote his literary story.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just the starting point for building identity.
Sabo: "Germans must play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, an expert on U.S. and Europe's links, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first admitted that it had voted against the Palestinians ' request for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stefan Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be cautious about its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, while not being too critical of Israel.
At the time of the rise in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the introduction of a restricted zone for flights.
As a result, NATO has put forward this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The case is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, and that is to say, it is from a policy that has been governed by the United States to a German foreign policy.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have a unified policy.
Thus, the Germans are again placed between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that while they are just grasping their role, they are on their way to "better normal" foreign policy.
Such an external policy that France or the United Kingdom pursues.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean in German terms?
It is a willingness to take a position that is not dependent on the position of the United States or European partners in their national interests.
I believe that German foreign policy is dependent on economic policy, that is, on exports and links with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany ' s economic interests differ significantly from those of other major States, and Germany should therefore protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has major trading markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Persian Gulf States.
It should therefore be cautious not to offend the public and the elite in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its part.
But I wouldn't give too much importance to that, it's not a completely unilateral relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Did Germany harm its relations with the United States by abstaining from important decisions, such as the Palestinian vote?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States, there is an understanding of the German position.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic as the Libyan question.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
This indicates that it should be taken seriously as a game on the international stage and that it should be considered to be of interest.
There are various views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the contrary, the United States had clearly stated the veto.
Is there a distinction between the United States and many European States?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama Government has a deep understanding of the European position.
But, of course, in the context of the local political situation, the Government cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that significant differences in opinion are not as important as it always seems.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, note that Obama is not at all stubbornly opposed to Netanyahu's policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close relationship with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the situation of the key partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, Germans would be slightly simpler if there were a single, non-controversial European policy, but that is not the case now.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and are forced to act instead, based only on their own vision.
That is how they come from the euro.
I think that Germany will play a leading role in developing a common European position in the future.
It is understandable that this is not easy for Germany, at least because of relations with Israel.
This subject has always been subtle.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, won't it really play a major role?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany has not been used to this, and it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany assumes an important role, the most diverse anti-German feelings are expressed.
The Germans aren't just dealing with it.
Actually, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the United States.
It should take into account the different neighbours and views, and that was not easy.
Thus, the influence of the United States in European politics is constantly weakening, but at this point the EU does not fill this vacuum, but who remains?
The Germans would simply have to play a more important role.
Even if you do not like it, it makes you feel uncomfortable or makes you feel unloved.

"Protection of trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren - too.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a very officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies from which it is established.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names submit a claim.
Yet, it is unclear if they will be able to stand up for their rights.
" Foreigners are becoming increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violations of the right to trademarks in the Far East.
On my desk every week, there's a new case of this kind.
Please add a few letters to the simulators to have the right to register their trade marks.
This is how Lu-Gucci gets from Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German companies are legally copied, such as the manufacturer of Puma sports goods.
The folder shall be opened with the records of the registration office of the trademarks in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trade mark, which also uses the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zenga.
The fact that the Chinese are the world champions for copying and violating intellectual property rights is known.
In large cities there are multi-faceted universities that sell almost exclusively subcontractions.
However, Pattloh's case is not the case, and according to his trustees, he is opposed to the fact that the Chinese companies have been given the right to use a name that is already being protected from the registration of trademarks.
The Chinese call it the ban minipai, the passenger brand.
This word is associated with the "ban dakuan."
That's what they call women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not recognize their guilt
"It harms the business, it has to be fought," Pattloh is convinced.
"The trade mark is empty, the unique situation is lost, the image is very painful."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected sectors are estimated by millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China, with a sales volume of 15 billion euros per year, is the third largest and fastest market for the sale of luxury goods.
However, it is difficult to remove the questionable entries in the trade marks register, and it is worth it.
The process can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
The plot relates to cases in which the court dismissed the case, since after a long period of time the contested term became "the reality of the market".
If the complainant does not succeed, he will even have to pay the plagiarism because he has damaged his trade mark in China, Patloch says.
Sometimes there's a jungle law here.
There are also famous cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had a court dispute with the manufacturer of Sany's construction machines, an enterprise that had recently acquired a Putzmeister concrete manufacturer.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The acquired Volvo Geely originally used a blue and white logo that reminded BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The fashion product manufacturer Lacoste lost copies of Hong Kong and Singapore in China, where the famous crocodile looked on the other side.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be guilty.
The notice of registration of CTMO trademarks in Beijing confirms that in 2010 there were difficulties due to the lack of staff and equipment in the premises.
But last year there was a "return from the emergency to the normal process".
Thus, the number of unprocessed cases of objections decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
At least 81,500 claims are still pending in the department.
Fighting That Cost
As often as in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million trade marks protection declarations were made to CTMO, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record means that China has, for the tenth time, led the list of new registrations worldwide, the department reports.
The same applies to the total number of valid trade marks, all 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan fees were paid.
To simplify, this means that each registration is worth an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
It's worth a lot more to protest, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concert has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarism.
The Germans were able to find that the illegal production of their fake car details had been eliminated.
However, the copycat secured Chinese rights for the Freudenberg trade mark.
This was its own loss, as the Germans are not protected, says Hanno Ventcler, Chairman of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities Board in Munich.
And the CTMO trade mark registration authority rejected the Munich claim.
True, Freudenberg has won in both of the following instances, but the opposing party continues to fight so far.
There must be a beginning.
The question is now before the Supreme Court.
Ventcler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money, and nerves."
If the internal costs are barely accounted for, the company's archive had to examine even the acts of centuries ago to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite side “a large six-digit amount in euro” for a settlement.
"It's clear how much it costs us," says Ventcler.
The dangers of the Far East are threatened to be even in Europe.
This is the case where copyrs record unprotected trade marks.
Thus, one Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The Group has long ceased its production in these areas, but has been able to prevent registration.
"There's got to be a start," says Ventcler.
Both he and Patloch's lawyer recommend that German companies be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions on the protection of trademarks, and foreigners should rather “all that is to be protected, registered in China,” says Ventcler.
Otherwise, it could be a lot more valuable than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses the last act of his trade mark drama, the party will have to pay the licence fees for its own name, explains Ventcler.
Otherwise, we're being driven out of the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: Flooding, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, Imbongh chorus repeats, and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice.
The history of relations that have exceeded 8733 kilometres.
First, the floodwaters: cowboy soaps, basketball crosses, ladies' ice creams and men's balls pick up tats on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
Two-three-four.
Only after that will the voices of the singers grow slowly -- Alt, bass, tenor and soprano -- they come up, admire and follow each other.
And Pete Hopph, a 29-year-old driver, doesn't jump out of his mother's shoes when he takes them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberge Choir Imbongi repeats a new song.
Fifty participants from 23 to 69 years of age, from human genetic experts to the courtroom, came to the recuperation.
"Om "Obani" is a simple thing, every voice of people has its own text, as well as in a completely foreign language: Zulu, where eleven million people speak in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self - Help
According to the United Nations AIDS Programme, there are approximately 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 AIDS orphans live.
More than 40 per cent of the population are HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Estiheni, the Association of Voices for Africa found leaders in Germany.
70 of them attend a school that prepares for further training.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take the lead.
It guarantees the child money for school, school and daily hot lunch in the Goo-Centre.
In the Zulu language, Imbongi means a storyteller or an admirer.
There's no running around in this room, so they can sing.
For nearly ten years, choirs have been studying songs in this foreign soft language, and from time to time, they have been brought back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
Because at 8733 kilometers of flight from Heidelberg, in the north-west of Swaziland, is the village of Esitheni, which depends on the voices of the German people.
Forty per cent infected
There are about 2,000 people, some of whom are still living in simple clay and salmon huts, among the inhabitants of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died of the HI virus.
In Estigen, the disease is reflected in the whole of Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest expected life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The cutoff of the limbs in men, which is proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, has almost not been adopted among the population.
More than forty per cent of the population of Swaziland have a virus of immunodeficiency, death in the middle of the fourth decade is not rare.
Hor opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in spring 2005, but before that, Immbogni saw a number of children on the streets who were not only concerned with parental care, but simply: food, clothing, education.
Without school education, people in a poor country have no chance at all.
First, it was a private obligation of individual participants - for a few euros a year to send the child to school and give him an opportunity to get hot food once a day.
But a year later, chorus founded the Voices for Africa, which has since been professionally concerned about AIDS orphans in Estonia.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are some of the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial PPPs include syphilis, chlamydiaz and tripper (gonorrhea).
HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes, and hepatitis are common viral HPVs.
Lobby pedicules and garlic are part of the parasitic RIP.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are common among men who engage in sex with men.
The Robert Koha Institute is based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilis registered in Germany are reported as a result of sexual relations between men.
Heterogeneous adults often experience sexually transmitted diseases, including Chlamydia infections, trichomonia, candidiasis (frequent), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of the new HIV infections are present in this group.
Among young people, Chlamydia infections occur significantly more often than among other groups of the population.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
We also often have a human papilloma virus among young people.
How does the number of cases of infection change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory registration.
Syphilis disease, according to Robert Koh Institute, has more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
It's about one tenth less than last year.
What symptoms are indicated by a veneer’s disease?
Infectious diseases, genital damage, wet discharge complaints, redness, lowering of the body, and musculoskeletal or embolism may occur.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain undetected.
How can we protect ourselves?
Preservatives can reduce the risk of infection but do not provide a percentage protection.
For partially transmitted sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact infection and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend a regular survey, especially in the case of frequent shifts in sexual partners.
Early diagnosis can cure most of the WFPs and avoid remote effects.
The bosses, donations, and not least the fees for the speeches made by people throughout Germany, make it possible to collect something.
"We have all sent about 200,000 euros to Estonia," said Annete Lennartz, president of the Association.
In the village itself, money from Germany is available to the Code of Dlamina, a conscious and active woman.
She also cares that the orphans are well-equipped, for example, in one of her grandmothers.
Gogos, as they call Zulu's old women, is the village's fortress.
Some of them took up to 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and took care that the children would appear in the classroom every day.
Those who are not yet born enter the home of Hanisil, a single woman who is paid for by the union as well as two bridesmaids who prepare for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, the Voices for Africa Association organized a Swiss school, built two smokers, and, together with the American PSI Health Organization, organized a HIV analysis for many villagers.
It is difficult to imagine, but the disease that is so evident throughout the country prefers to be deeply silent.
King with 14 women
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it is related to sexuality."
It is quite unusual for a country in which the king has 14 women.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswat III, is known for his love of deserts.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, the lifestyle of such an authorized State is also responsible for the spread of the HIV virus so rapidly over the past years.
But it's also on shipworkers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they're almost out of use.
Another culture is the flesh of the flesh."
In order to support a little cultural exchange, Ibmogni's choirs travel to South Africa every two to three years and sing songs, full breasts, war spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many on the southern side of the Black continent have known since the apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in black - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but, even, has caused tears in the eyes of heavy borderers.
The trip is always carried to Estonia, where singers visit undershepherds.
Although a small village can hardly be found on the map, it is more known in the Eculven Valley.
"Go to Estonia, there's the light," people say.
And after a 8733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, when the heated singers return to the Reception Hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is also burning here.
Messenger: NASA opens ice in Mercury
Zand Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on planet Mercury.
The ice cover may have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The United States Space Agency has proved that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
Although close to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as shown by three studies published in the special journal Science.
Zand Messenger has found evidence that the ever-changing region of the planet is covered by ice.
Its thickness shall be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 metres.
It is likely that the water comes from comets or perhaps the asteroids that met with Mercury.
No one connects the opening of ice with the existence of life on the planet, says scientific director of the wisdom of Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these openings could help explain how water and other building elements of life have fallen elsewhere in the solar system.
For the inhabitants of the Earth, the senses, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix, are studying the depths of the Universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small holes in endless gifts.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Plank Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the Carlic Planet of Cerra.
Like Pluto, who is talking about the Sun behind Neptune, Cerra, as a new definition of the international astronomical union of 2006, is not “planned”.
This fragment of the infrared photo of the Telescope Spitzer represents a family portrait of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue points, it is more difficult to identify the pink "new" stars in a star circle.
This region of star formation - scientists call it W5 unromantically - an open telescope "Spitzer" in Cassiopey, over 6500 light years.
This passing flame of a dying star photographed the NASA Telescope "Spitzer".
It looks like a ring is made of material that the star emitted in the process of dying.

One of the largest and clearest pictures of the Hubble telescope: the Waterworth galaxy
Depending on the colouring of the pictures of the spiral galaxies, they are transformed into the present works of art.
The published European South Observatory shows Trifid's miseries in the constellation of the Arrow for several thousand light years.
The name Trifid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (triangular, triangular), since dark dust strips divide the heart of the star into three parts.
In the constellations of the Star, astronomers photographed space collisions: at the distance of 400 million light-years from the Earth, the two floating galaxies meet together and are inevitable.
This was the birth of the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
A person who does not like technical reductions may call it the Southern Cycling College.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows Iris' nebulity fragment in Cefe's constellation.
The fog, which has been removed for 1400 light years, consists of dust particles, from 10 to 100 times the size of the usual domestic dust.
This image was composed of optical and x-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, which is 430 million light years away from Earth.

There is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The star bell keeps creating new stars.
This star cloud, coupled with Rosetka's fog, is also constantly creating new stars, at the distance of 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this bright glowing galaxy with a little black hole, there's no dust yet, just gas.
Researchers suggest that it arose shortly before the Great Explosion when the universe was essentially hydrogen.
Our Opinions in the Universe: Key Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented by Hans Lippersgeem in 1608, even before Galileo Galileo began observing the stars a year later.
From that time on, optical telescopes have become increasingly visible, and their view of space is becoming more and more profound.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Big Binocular Telescope was established.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
Grand Telescopio Canarias has a giant internal device - the diameter of a single mirror is 10.4 metres.
The Great South African Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to reduce its value.
However, in diameter it reaches about 11 meters.
Lack of low-cost construction: the telescope is firmly anchored below a vertical angle, which limits its movement.
The Hobby Eberley Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its speciality: high light-collection capacity.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the largest world telescopes.
With the help of radiotelescope in Aresibo (Puerto-Rico), researchers are listening to alien signals in space.
Radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
By participating in the "Exterior Intelligence Search" project (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing its computing power.
Species at the Observatory of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) in the Andes of Chile.
There's "The Big Telescope" here, which is entirely in line with its name.
Its four mirrors enable the visible tube to illuminate even the average infrared spectrum.
The Chilean ESO Observatory also plans to establish a European Large Telescope Assessment.
Its main mirror must be broken down by 42 metres and will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, photographs should be expected not before 2018.
By 2007, both Kek telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors of ten meters in diameter.
Kek Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory, which also looks into the sky with the help of Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, there must be a new giant telescope in Mauna Kea, with a mirror diameter of 30 metres.
They can fall in love with illustrations here.
However, the most important species in space is provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, it has provided pictures of far-reaching worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system, especially where life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1235 candidates had been identified from the start of the mission.
The photos include the latest preparations of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webba Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space not earlier than 2018 on the Arian 5 missile.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the Great Explosion in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists assume that Mercury has ice on the southern shelf.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as "Messenger" is heading closer to the North Pole of the planet.
Radar measurements over decades indicated that there is ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the "Messenger" sense launched in 2004, the first to come back to Mercury, scientists are now convinced of this.
Sing oil every day - and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a more honourable age in the Bible.
There's even a long-term museum here.
Looking for a reflection in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a more honourable age in the Bible.
There's even a long-term museum here.
Looking for a reflection in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
Travel through the Tales Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
The minibus with a loud voice is on the high road beyond the densely forested hills, stormy hills, and simple Christian homes.
Everything around is so green and bright that you might think you're in Schwarzwalde.
But it's the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, and the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
The people of the Caucasus are living here, and they know little about it, but they speak beautifully in the Persians and Azerbaijani, and they are different from the people of the Arabians.
The final item is Leric.
The small town boasts too heavy an architecture of Soviet times, which does not at all harmonize with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too tired.
It's eight hours away at 323 kilometers, because the road has only one field.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the Caspian Sea oil is here in the province until it has arrived.
However, Pilate Fatulaev (48) is convinced that there is nothing to interest tourists in Lerika.
"In May Baku was celebrated by the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulaeva.
She's the director of the long-standing museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here is a documentary of about eight dozen of these places, over 100 years old. Fatulaeva points to a black and white photograph.
That's my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child
But the controversial museum is the Shirali Muslim chapan, which has been reported to be 168 years old.
The birth certificate, however, does not.
In view of the fact that the older person, whose age is confirmed by the documents, was 122 years old, Muslim age seems to be extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulaeva.
The man had been married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136, he reportedly had a daughter.
So did the Muslim chaplain add up to his age by a few decades?
Even Rembrandt Shollz, a senior researcher at the Max Plank Institute in Rostok, heard of debtors in Central Asia.
“Many of the elderly can also meet in some areas of China, Japan or the Gulf of Hunza in Pakistan,” says Shollz, “the very very old people also live in Sardinia.”
However, because of the lack of documents, it is not possible to confirm age because there were no civil registers.
Each day a bottle of hot oil
Nevertheless, the fact is that people in the area of Lerica are often very young.
Now 20 people over 100 years of age are living here.
Why here, in the south, so many debtors?
The Azerbaijani Faryd Muhimzade tour guide explains this by a special talisman.
The director of the Fatulaeva Museum, on the other hand, believes it's a matter of food.
The fats love meat, bread and the most dairy products, many of them drink on a hot oil bottle every day, but if such a high-calorie diet can hardly be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or is it in the early life that keeps people young? In Chengemeera, a fragile village close to the city of Leric, Rubab Mirzoeva lives.
At the age of 97, she was still relatively young for this range.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasian region.
She's sitting on the floor with a side of the oil, which she's not standing there.
There are eight persons living under one roof, including one of the sons and the daughter of Mirzaev, who have long had their grandchildren.
They'll also jump two little ones in the vicinity.
In the kitchen, guests are prepared for tea, which is supplied in typical sparkling glass of Armouda.
In Mirza's ideally flat and strong white teeth, under the main plate she avoids long dark-haired hairs that her son proudly exposes before us.
I'm always my hair with milk, so they've never come out and kept the color.
"And I've never used champagne," Mirzaev says.
The monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate just what grew up in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, cucumbers.
For the rest of my life, I never bought a product at a store.
Then she tells about her husband, who served in the army.
The worst was after World War II.
But it's better when the "loving father" Geedar Aliev got up in the wheel.
Propaganda does not often sound like an old woman.
However, the culture established around the father of the nation, which ruled by the country as dictator, in Azerbaijan hardly knows the boundaries.
He was in power before 2003, and then his son Ilham was taken by the government.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among Azerbaijani elders.
Mirzaeva receives 230 manats (approximately the same amount of the euro) as a monthly pension, for local conditions it is the amount to which you can live well.
And perhaps the long-standing son of Mirzaev also rights: "The old people in our culture enjoy deep respect."
They live in a large family of loved ones, surrounded by caring and happy people.
No reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word “human rights” is not in the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Contestant demonstrations in Cairo show a deep gap in the country.
The future Shariate-based constitution has met with fierce resistance.
The Egyptian President did not gather for the Paphos.
We need to create a transition.
"And his success lies in my responsibility to the people and to the God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but primarily to Christian dignitaries, liberals, educated Muslims, and nonreligious Egyptians.
Indeed, all of them, who have thus far been hopelessly divided in a disunited opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the religious State in Nile for the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohammed Mursey, if you don't apologize, said he temporarily cut the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and extended his jurisdiction to "to save the revolution."
However, the fact is that the 61-year-old engineer, who is a doctor at the University of South California, does not really want to save the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles have been able to take a 15-hour walk in the night with obstacles to the Islamic constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is a part of the fear.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that court proceedings are based on the “principles of Islamic law”.
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and remains the case for interpretation, and it could be feared that Islamists would use the vague language and the resulting legal wave for a more strict interpretation of the Sharia.
At least one newly introduced article suggests this: in all cases relating to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University Council, the most important Islamic institution of the country, which enjoys great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be called upon.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy oversee legislation, that de facto would result in a limitation of the judiciary.
Much in the draft Constitution is the subject of interpretation
Another problem: Civilians must remain subject to the military court.
These courts, during the period of Mubarak, served to oppress the opponents.
As soon as the dictator was in military custody, up to 11,000 civilians were present.
Also, as stated in the draft, the State must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “maintain its morality and values”.
Legally, this is so vague that public institutions can control even the content of cinema and literature through this article.
Open text means nothing more than censorship.
In fact, no article establishes direct equality between men and women.
Therefor the other nation forbidden that they should revile and revile the apostle Muhammad and his apostles.
But what such insults and how they should be punished remains unclear.
It is also questionable to say that it is prohibited to “entreat people”.
Is it enough to paint a president or joke about a lawyer?
The question of interpretation, as well as many in this project, which Morsi proposed for signature, and which he said would be presented to the Egyptians at a referendum.
"Revolution has returned"
A few weeks have passed since opposition to the superiority of Islamists was formed.
Tens of thousands gathered in extraordinary loneliness on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and swore to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbachi, who took the third place in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Authority, Mohammed El-Baradei, said that the draft Constitution was “a waste of history”.
Because of the short news service, he accused Mursy's undertakers of wanting to lead the "path against democracy".
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and throw it away," said opposition Jasser Said.
"We have not stood up yet, our brothers' blood has not yet been avenged," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition policy of Haled Ali.
Many judges have also reported that they do not want to observe the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for a counter-demonstration, but, with caution, not in Tahrir Square, but after the mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile before the University of Cairo.
It was attended by a large number of women under the roofs and the commitments of the Salafites, who shouted: “The people require the application of God’s law.”
They demanded Murcy, "Clean the country," and they swore, "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic place on which it all began provoked the state of practically civil war.
The pursuers of Murcy obviously didn't want to take that risk.
"Muslim Brothers" said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to allow the people to decide in the electoral order where the country should go.
Most of the Islamic project is considered to be a decisive case.
"The notion of "human rights" is never mentioned"
Hafiz Abu Saeda was angry with this forced constitutional process, which should have been extended until February with the participation of all the public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (ODA) protected the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison in Mubaraka or presented to the court.
Not because he divided their view of peace, but because human rights are inseparable for him.
That's why he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" are never found in a new constitution, he regrets in a conversation with "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of Mursy's influence on all three branches of government in the State disappoints a lawyer.
These measures represent a clear impact on the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civilian state, the President de facto cancelled it," said Saida regrettably.
For democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even an international community that looks at the ideological struggle of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be the payout.
A protestor at Tahrir Square warns: "You create a monster you cannot control."
Norway’s Cancer: the world’s most insidious fish?
Norway's five million people have one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Perhaps the secret of the country's success is somehow linked to a local passion for one extremely evil fishing trip?
Take a few crushed pieces of cheese.
Put them in the corner of dirty and soft sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You'll get the wrong smell of cancer -- one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but in the air, there's an inexhaustible distinctive smell.
Racfisk is a salty, salty, water-flavored raft before the year, depending on what the soul needs to achieve.
As the Sumerians gather and freeze, the crowds of Norwegians gather at the Fagernes festival, which is about this very thing, let's say it's a fascinating ritual.
"They eat raw and drink with a bucket of water, a local dark water," explains Howard Halvarsen, a local fire department in the profession and a "racfisc general", who runs the festival.
People around us eat small fish and drink it with small portions of alcohol.
"Someone likes more aquavit than a crab," says Howard.
This drink can break the smell.
I'll try a couple of pieces.
If you can carry a piece under your nose, it's not so bad - it's a little different from the sushi portion you've been driving on the bus for a long time.
Racfisk is a Norwegian product from a totally different time, a time of poverty when, before the colds came up, the fish were stuck in hermetically closed bottles with salt water.
Then it was deep winter, when the fish were well and well fed, pulled it out, and swallowed the alcohol, and used it for food.
Even more, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to migrate mainly to the United States is a reminder of the fact of the past generation.
Now the population is growing rapidly, with more than 13 per cent of the immigrants taking jobs, high wages and a developed social security system.
The people of Sweden (the former rival and not so long and much more congested) come here to work.
Racfisk is regarded as an important symbol, a constant, even a few evil elements of previous Norway.
It's one of the most expensive local sights.
On the other hand, there will be 9 pounds of sterling (U.S.) worth of beer or sandwiches.
Norway has rarely appeared in world news, and most of its inhabitants seem to have it.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name Anders Brayvik, racist and extremist right-wing crowd last year who shot and killed 77 men, women and children.
Not to mention his name, the act is called “the 22 July.”
Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their peace-loving country, one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and killings.
On the basis of today's well-being, Norway (from the beginning of the seventies) is one of the world's largest oil-gas industries.
"The same oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our officer, who has a variety of long-haired cancers, a woman with long-haired hair and particularly blue eyes, filling the Nordic well-being.
We are such a people, as you call them, who are despicable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English beautifully.
We don't like showing, we're not proud.
Norway is very careful about its oil -- most of the oil industry's revenues are invested in a special fund established for future generations.
In the years prior to the global financial crisis, when all the money they did not have was wasted, Norway carefully counted all the costs.
"As long as you can swim on the snowflakes and walk in summer, that's enough for happiness," Anna says.
"And there's a cancer," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm sitting in the snow in the middle of something to eat, and I'm going to have enough cancer.
Here's a hamburger with salmon meat, it's just exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening we are waiting for an even greater number of the same fish with unforgettable smell.
In my hotel there is a special dinner about cancer, during which visitors vote to determine the best or perhaps the most aromatic fish.
There's a direct telephone showing the lead in the Grandfather's Galshoke, surrounded by the Raphais.
It's like a song contest "Eurovision".
"So, Tor-Urgen, what's your assessment of the best fish in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone's falling off a chair, maybe, rescinding the aquarium.
Maybe just by blowing the smell of that fish.
Mexico President Enrique Peña Nieto is facing a difficult career.
While the newly elected President of Mexico Enrique Peña Nueto is preparing to enter the post, correspondent BBC Will Grant invites us to look at the challenges he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's people.
The road movement in Mexico is now particularly in a crying state.
The city was overloaded by transport and in good time, and from Monday, a number of key highways were taken to the capital, causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protests from falling into the building of Parliament.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will make a presidential move and accept the flag of the country.
There's a challenge ahead of him.
Mexico has achieved good economic performances with Felipe Calderon, who is now in office, but the country has been in war with drugs, which has already had some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My Government tells the people of Mexico that it is prepared to fight violence," Mr. Peña Nueto reported earlier this week to the President of the United States of Barack Obama at the Oval Office of the White House.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.
Prior to such statements by the President of the United States, the political career of Mr. Pennja Nueto developed as Governor of his native state of Mexico.
In his family, in a densely populated and large state surrounding the capital of the country, the views of the new leader were divided.
A straight-line man
In the idyllic town of Vale de Bravo, for example, they remember it with warmth.
The residents deserve a revitalization of tourism, the development of the resort and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of Mr. Pennja Nueto's new bosses, who are quite different from the road with the excavatings and pits that had been in the area before.
The tables with its name depend on the modern building of the sports centre and on an impressive interactive climate change museum.
"We link with him hopes for real and serious changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olver Ernandes, State Congressman of the Head of the New Institution-Revolution Party (PRI).
We expect the current and decisive changes that our country so urgently needs, especially in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous stay of the PRI party, Visente Fox was expelled in 2000.
Congressman Olver acknowledged that, following his 12-year absence in the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the party had high hopes for Enrique Peña Nueto.
He also refuted the allegations of incompetence that had led to the opposition of the new President.
He is very direct and very committed to the fulfillment of his vision of the future country.
He is an excellent public figure, and above all, a man who is able to listen.
But in the second part of the state, many people had a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualkoitl, also known as Ciudad Nes, is the most striking contrast with the powerful streets of Vale de Bravo.
Hidden under the highways, it is in many ways the suburbs of Mexico itself.
And problems in the municipality are also severe in this megapolis.
Earlier this year, troops were involved in arming drug-trafficking gangs in these areas, and violence against women was particularly acute.
A few dozen bodies of murdered women have been found in the desert near the extensive garbage dump just in the last two years.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico during the reign of Mr. Peña Nueto, which is much higher than that in the tragic violence of the city of Sudad-Huares, whose name has become offensive when it comes to the killing of innocent women.
According to opponents, Mr. Peña Nueto, it is best to say that he was unable to deal with the issue of the murder of women while he was serving as governor.
In the worst case, his administration was accused of ignoring the problem completely.
The citizen of a concrete house, like most of the houses in the surrounding area, Irina Buendia is hard to stop her tears, showing me pictures of her deceased daughter Marian Luna.
The official version of Mariana killed herself in 2010.
However, her family believed that she had been killed by a firefighter.
"When I got to her house, it seemed as if her body had been washed before," recalls Mrs. Bundy.
There were signs of her being beaten, and the body had already been raised.
The mother of Mariana is telling the story, and the portrait of her daughter is looking at us from the wall, where she hangs next to the bedside, where only one word is drawn: justice.
That is what they say the family was denied.
"The officials of the state treated me like an old bunny, a poor offender of peace.
They want people to accept everything they say and to be small.
But it's wrong, it's not possible, especially when so many violations and shortcomings are around," she says.
With the President's shift on Saturday, President Peña Nueto will take on an awkward responsibility with her.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violence, and the new President has promised to make this issue a priority during his reign.
"I hope he will be exactly the same president as he was the governor," said Olver, a congressman from Vale de Bravo from the PRI party.
However, that is what the victims of the Ciudad Ness are most concerned about.
Bradley Manning hasn't complained about ill-treatment, says the prosecution.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's statements about the poor conditions of detention.
The hearing focused on Manning's stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Protection requires the closure of the case on the grounds that the terms of Manninga ' s detention were cruel.
The U.S. Army is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that the ranks of Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not take advantage of the opportunity to file a complaint of ill-treatment, which he said had to be transferred to a military prison.
During a cross-examination at the pre-trial hearing in Fort-Midde, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Fein said that the weekly visits to Manning by the prison administration for nine months in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
A cross-examination of the application for protection of Manning on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and that he himself had been sufficient punishment was carried out on the following day, after Manning stated that he was under arrest, he intended to commit suicide.
Military intelligence analysis expert arrested in June 2010 was accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents during the service in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that the source of information was Manning.
During Friday's hearing, Prosecutor Fein and Manning examined the reports that had been completed following a visit by the officials of Manning during his visit to Quantico Prison, where he was in strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits, prison officials asked Manningu questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Fein asked on Friday about the reports, Manning acknowledged that he considered the treatment of the prison administration as “superior” and the general conditions of detention as “professionally organized”.
The reports considered did not contain complaints of ill-treatment, although Manninga had been directly asked about the conditions of his detention, Faine said.
Manning replied that he had voiced concern about these problems and that his representatives had discussed these problems with him and had stated that they would take care of them, but had not fixed it in writing.
"They wrote "no problems" (after my complaints) but that doesn't mean that I didn't raise this topic in conversation," says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Deniz Lind, also asked Manninga why he did not complain of mistreating him in January 2011 at a meeting of the Commission on suicide intentions, which he had written a few months earlier.
Manning replied that at that meeting, he wanted to get rid of the "trafficking prevention" regime and mitigated conditions of detention.
Military leaders explained that a limited detention regime, at a lower level than the surveillance regime to prevent suicide, had been introduced to protect the prisoner and to protect the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I am all right for them to cancel the anti-trafficking regime... to improve the level of my life from my point of view," Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning testified to his arrest in Iraq and to his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to a military-martial prison in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that thoughts of suicide had appeared to him in Kuwait, and that he once lost consciousness because of a severe fire.
He explained that psychologically very difficult when you are not told how your participation is being decided and what is going on in the outside world.
"My world complains to the Camp-Arian base, to the size of my prison," Manning said on Thursday.
- I thought I'd die in this cell."
While in Quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small room at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours a day in total loneliness.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only the mattress, clothing, strippers, several items of clothing and glasses.
He says he was trying to move, as sleeping or even lying in the middle of the day banned the rules.
According to Manning, in his sleep, he had a constant light that penetrated the outside of the camera.
If his guards did not see him when he was returning to bed at night, they would wake him up and force him to turn back.
Counsel Manning made a formal objection to the abuse of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manninga was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he made on Thursday that after one night he was forced to sleep in his room in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners on the morning check.
Manning said he could not cover the blanket during the check.
In answer to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's orders that he should throw away the clothes that he could cover, but admitted that no one had ordered him to throw it directly.
On Thursday Manning said that he was forced to sleep naked last night because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the officer that he could use a rabbit or a rabbit to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his lower whites, abrasions and eyes were taken out of the camera.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had had to survive at the time of the detention and would significantly reduce the term of detention if Manning was recognized as guilty by the military court, which should begin his case at the beginning of next year.
The defence stated that it was planning to propose that Manningu acknowledge guilt for less serious crimes and other charges as excessive.
Resumption of the hearings is planned for these outcomes, and it is expected that the accused will insist that conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the content of arrests with a maximum strict regime.
Among the charges brought by Manningu, the defendant is considered a helper, the illicit promotion of Internet disclosure, the transmission of national defence information, and the abduction of public property or documents.
If he is convicted under all the paragraphs of the indictment, he may be threatened by a life sentence.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of the American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunity to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the people of the difficult times in the country.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin are breaking up between two cultures.
During my recent trip to Mexico, I went on a corridor for the arrivals, approached the border control area, and stopped at the site.
The signs were indicated in two rows: one for Mexicans, the other for Foreigners.
I've been standing in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and my whole life was called a Mexican.
It's just a conditional name, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends from New York call themselves Italians.
Later, I stopped at the complex design of "American of Mexican origin".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's family, there was no need for conditional names or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than those who have language, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport, and I became in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago, when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nueto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The agenda was devoted to the meetings of the presidents of those countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nueto spoke freely about the rise of the Mexican economy, which, with the same success, would enable Mexicans to remain in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to enter into a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and to create some North American trading block like the European Union.
In addition, President Peña Noya promised to continue the war against drug addicts in Mexico, but no specific proposals had been made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a serious and committed issue.
Most Americans had never thought that in 1848 the United States had invaded Mexico and had forced its leaders to give up half their territory.
But the Mexicans think for centuries, not for minutes, and they see memories of those events all over the world.
Therefore, it is only for a U.S. government official to make a plea of criticism on the part of Mexico, in the press and in the elite of Mexican society, that there are complaints that Americans are concerned with the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And Montesuma's descendants are filled with war.
Mexico's relations with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin living in the United States are the most complex.
Do you want to talk about insults?
That's enough.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities in that country and those who do not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican origin were only one reason: at some point in their family history, a father or a grandfather had no opportunity to realize himself in Mexico and had to go north.
Most of the time, they were Mexicans of a certain type, poor, poor Christian families.
We're their descendants, and we remember that.
It's different in Mexico.
Today, our life is the fulfillment of American dreams, we've learned in good schools and we've built up a good job, but we don't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country to consider as its own.
United States of America.
We also know that most representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We answer the same thing.
They remind us of humiliating injuries, and they refer to us as people of the second kind as unreal Mexicans.
We don't speak Spanish enough, and our relationship with Mexico is not strong enough.
Our very existence is due to their failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We would not now be in a sluice, finding a comfortable life in the United States, but losing our spiritual relationship.
My wife was born in Guadalhare and legally moved to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are certain exercises between these Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin - Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and the Americans of Mexican origin is insulting.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes that she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my well-known Mexican Americans do not feel that they belong to any of them.
We're listening to the Mexican group Los Tigers del Norte, but we love Bruce Springstine.
Getting the best out of two worlds, you're definitely losing the roots.
We're Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my visit, as our relationships are not sufficiently confused, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want the Americans of Mexican origin to work with the Ambassadors of Mexico and represent her interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how well to visit it, and could convince the political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
Nothing's gonna work out.
Too many attempts in the past.
And given the gap between the rich and the poor, the gap between corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country to be so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but get along with it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans are still unable to forgive the United States for their dealings with Mexico for a century ago, they will also have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican origin are still in the process of dealing with their relatives in Mexico quite recently.
Yes, it is.
Please, we're more general than I thought.
Old Battles in the New Near East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas Group could become a fragile foundation for further peace
Will the long - term peace between the Arabs and the Israelites in the Middle East be possible?
A major round of bloodshed has led to the conclusion that such hopes are ineffective.
There were regular, meaningless disputes about who was the first to start; many buildings were turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis, were killed; for the first time during the conflict, rockets released from the Gaza Strip had fallen into the vicinity of the Israeli capital Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the hopelessness of the Israelis and the Palestinians in their eternal conflict, the changes have taken place in the Middle East.
This may be different, but the events of the Arab Spring surrounded many of the established realities and the Palestinians and the Israelis were unable to stay away from the drought that shook the region.
Their fight may result in even more bloodshed than before.
There are, however, reasons to hope that this deadly dump will come out.
War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation does not give rise to optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on 21 November, would be carried out, the clashes that took place this week only strengthened the positions of the forcemen on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamic movement Hamas, who came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, said that they had forced Israel to withdraw despite their losses.
Although some group leaders have been destroyed, 1.7 million people are trapped in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank of the Jordan River, another Palestinian territory controlled by the now more moderate Fath movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can come to the conclusion that time is working on them.
As the influence of Islamic movements in the Arab world grew, new influential and rich friends appeared in Hamas.
The emerging regional leader of Turkey, who had once been Israel's closest ally among the Muslim countries, supported Hamas, who followed her example, Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic developing States of the Persian Gulf.
The trading supporters of Hamas declare the establishment of an Islamic semi-monthly Israel - from Lebanon to northern Lebanon, where Hezbollah is led by a military group, to Syria, in which the more pro-Islamic rebels are being attacked by the power of Bashar Assad, and further to Jordan, where the king's allies are threatened by Hamas.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood was strengthened by President Muhammad Morris.
Hosni Mubarak, which was ruled by Egypt for 30 years, was a world dictator who did not pay particular attention to Hamas.
Muslim brothers, on the other hand, are an organization, much like Hamas, and their leaders are more inclined to populism.
In future diplomatic positions, Hamas may become a significant player whose voice will not silence even Israel and America.
At the same time, Israel's hardline supporters will come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was entrusted.
The Israeli Anti-Range System has justified the cost of its establishment and has successfully destroyed many of Hamas launched missiles.
The citizens of Israel can sleep quietly, at least for a while.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to its continued position; many European countries also blamed Hamas for the beginning of the last round of violence.
Another important factor was Israel ' s economic prosperity, particularly with the Government of Binyam Netanyahu, which had largely ignored the peace process.
Although, since 2004, approximately 30 Israelis have been killed by missiles released from Gaza, Israel has been able to minimize the problem of deadly terrorists, partly from the wall that enters the territory of the West Bank of the Jordan, a large part of the unrecognised Palestinian State, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite such illegal acts in the light of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, in preparation for the 22 January elections, has joined even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Abigail Liberman, very comfortable.
What is the purpose of creating and giving Palestinians their own State?
If they put all their power in the territory of the West Bank, would they not start the rockets on Israel's side, as their assemblies in the Gaza Strip do?
It would be better to keep them behind the wall and severely crush any attempts to lift their heads.
The hardline proponents may win; however, their calculations may be contradicted by the Arab Spring.
While Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries have no warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defence part of the Israeli budget is greater than all its Arab neighbours, together.
The establishment of a war against the regional superpower will not help Arab Governments to strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of Egypt's President, Murcy, who worked with Barack Obama on the ceasefire, was a good sign and could mark the beginning of change.
Israel should, at least to a minimum, take into account the long-term implications of its policy.
As democratic change occurs in Arab countries, the deprivation of the right of Palestinians to self-determination is a slow-acting bomb that will blow up early or late in the Israeli-occupied territories, like a bus blasted in Tel Aviv this week.
Repressions have already undermined the foundations of a democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic aspect of the growth of the Arab population is only exacerbating these problems.
For blood transfusions carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress Hamas movement, the international community has to pay for increasing discontent.
Both sides need an external impulse
There remains the only solution to be called upon by well-being representatives from both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the education of two States and Israel's replacement for security.
The hope that the ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the side of the conflict is not too pressing in the short term.
Egypt, which for a long time has decided to cease arms transfers to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, has, as never before, a favourable position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the shared use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fath movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian State than a forthcoming UN vote, which could result in the recognition of the virtual state of Palestine.
President Obama should also play his part in putting Israel behind the negotiating table.
During his first term, he did not present his own plan for a peaceful settlement.
Upon his return to the White House, he continued to demonstrate his unwillingness to join in on this issue.
It's a catastrophicly unmistakable position.
The United States is vitally interested in the stability of the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia has entered into force a uniformly packaged cigarette law.
Warnings of the harm of smoking and images of body parts affected are contrasted with those of one-off green cartons, which are the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world practice of Australia ' s single pack of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force by replacing the logo and colouring of different brands with the same color of evaporation with yellow pictures of the disease of parts of the body and images of children whose health is damaged by their parents ' smoking.
In addition to the various images and inscriptions warning of the harm of smoking, the only difference between the spots imposed on this Saturday is the name of the marks printed with the same small font.
These are the harshest conditions in the world for packaging tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, thereby depriving this harmful habit of fashion.
Such a decision was based on studies that showed that people who did not start smoking up to 26 years of age in 99 cases of 100 never become smokers.
“It is obvious that even at the very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to bring in by means of packaging,” explains Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, referring to studies that show that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with children with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the world's smallest proportions of smokers, so these changes will not be particularly affected by the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering such measures.
The tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market where cheap and accessible cigarettes will be sold.
"This law will lead to serious consequences that are different from those that were conceived by its initiators," says Scott McKintair, a representative of British American Tobacco company in Australia.
Manufacturers of sub-product from China and Indonesia will place far more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the contrary, new laws contribute to business growth.
Sandra Ha, from a small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for porters and silicone pedestrians covering unpleasant pictures on the package has grown rapidly (in practice from zero) since only two months ago, such companies as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the high court of Australia, where they tried to appeal to this law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already carried out some six thousand products for opal trading companies and is expecting a new party.
It's a good business for us.
The potential for the effectiveness of such measures is, in the opinion of the experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population to which these measures are addressed.
Following the adoption in Australia of a number of laws that have made and supported illegal television advertising of cigarettes and that prohibit sellers from displaying cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Government of Australia has prohibited local companies and websites from posting advertising online, but it cannot limit the use of foreign websites.
"If you trade tobacco products and you only have this little lasagna left, the idea of moving your goods online will prove to you extremely captivating," explains Becky Freeman, a researcher at the University of Sydney.
The Freeman notes an increase in the number of reviews on trademarks written by people who claim to be ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is this really the case of a number of citizens who love Marlboro cigarettes so much that they don't regret the power and the time and make a video, or is the advertising company worth it?
The Australian office of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more involved in adapting to new rules than advertising.
The tobacco industry has even taken measures such as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge new rules: these States submit claims under the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been subject to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations with Australia are very small.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plibersek, the Government had discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first mandatory placement of photos to prevent the risk of smoking.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being considered in Britain, New Zealand, the USA and India.
The number of smokers in Australia is not demonstrably subject to innovation.
These pictures don't bother me.
I just don't pay attention.
"You're just taking out a cigarette and putting a doll in a carnival," explains Victor El Haeg, who buys a cigarette with a picture of a mouthful of the doll on the doll.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James Yu, a store manager of the King of the Pack tobacco products in the center of Sydney, claims that the same package has complicated the task of placing the goods in stock
"I used to have a new party run out of time, and now it's four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, then we would say, what to do, okay, we're closing the store," he says, shaking his hands up.
It's not that bad. It's not that bad.
On that day, thanks to me, I had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical failure and replaced it with another plane that we were waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of the boredom.
I won't lie to you.
The full day at the airport waiting for the trip is really boring, and there won't be much help in books, magazines, iPhones, or even a free store.
In recent times, however, more and more scientists and child development professionals have spoken out in favour of pregnancy.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children, it is not so bad.
This causes the brain to drift away from interesting related topics that may contribute to creativity.
And since in today's world we're all standing in front of a screen, the benefits of the boredom are beyond us.
Maybe we should try to get bored?
Yeah.
And there's no time.
We'll get back to it.
I used to think, like many others, that boredom was a invention of relatively recent times when people had more leisure time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, Professor of Greek and Roman History of the University of Calgary, author of the book A Life History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"In fact, the boredom can be praised by a very ancient story," he says.
The walls of Pompeii contain Latin inscriptions of the first century.
This remains an open question about how we understand the boredom.
The problem is, says John D. Isiod, Deputy Professor of York University, Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and the vision of fatigue has often changed.
Having studied the research material on this subject and asked the task force in 100 people, Professor Izida and his colleagues came up with the following definition: boredom is when people "want, but can't do what they'd like."
The difference between fatigue and apathy, he says, is that the grieving person does not do something that he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything when I'm sick.
He said, chiefly in anxiety, that was “a violation of attention and related deterioration of mood and feeling that time was running out slowly”.
According to the description of the pregnancy, it may be very similar to depression.
However, Professor Istud argues that despite the possible linkages between these conditions, people with disabilities see the causes of problems in the surrounding world and circumstances, and people with depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're actually just having a hard time focusing on something.
In his study “An Ingenious Mind: Determining Concern,” published in the September edition of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Izida and his colleagues referred to the previous experiment, whose participants heard a vote reading the magazine.
Some participants also heard loud sounds not related to the telegram in the neighbouring room, others heard the same sounds in low noise, so they could hardly be understood, and the third group listened only to the recording of the voice without a side sound.
Those who heard low - noise television noted that they were bored, that others often found it difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for it and attributed it to boredom.
When we are trying to focus on a difficult or challenging task, the interruption of attention may cause boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, neurology assistant professor at the University of Gwelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we're doing something uninterested, "for example, looking into the stream of goods on the conveyor in search of a marriage that distracts music can help to avoid boredom."
It is believed that when people start getting up on the table or drawing caracles on the paper list, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that such actions really help not to relax physically.
“The study has shown that children who are not forbidden to go back and forth learn better and remember more information than children who need to sit calm,” says Professor Fenske.
At some point, all of us are bored: at the delay of the trip (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninterested movie.
However, different people have shown different degrees of tendency to complain.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special “clumsy scale” to measure such individual characteristics.
Questions and allegations such as “Many of what I have to do, uniformly and monotonously” or “I’m too interested, so there’s no time for anything”.
Through such questionnaires, researchers have found that boys are missing more girls, says Steven Vodanovic, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when there are various external dissidents.
In general, however, teenagers are often missing out on a lot of things.
In 1991, Rid Larson, a professor of personal and public development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment involving nearly 400 adolescents and their parents 7-8 times a day with the help of the pager.
He received the following results: 32 per cent of adolescents said they were bored at school and during homework, and 23 per cent said they were bored outside the school.
Only 3 per cent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he does not have any data on what would be the same about the miscarriage now 21 years later.
However, he knows that “at an early age, there is a tendency to be bored”, mainly because children and adolescents are not able to decide what to do.
Let's go back to my original question: is it boring?
Sometimes there is no, because in extreme manifestations, as research has shown, it can induce people to engage in absurd and dangerous physical activities, risky gambling, or abuse of certain substances in an attempt to break free from pregnancy.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have been thinking about the relationship between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovic, who has devoted more than two decades to studying the problem.
"So our brain tells us we should do something else; it's a joke," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
However, the brain itself does not always know what to do.
If you're bored and you make that energy a guitar or a culinary experience, you'll do better.
But if you get to watch TV, you're only gonna get better for a while, and it's gonna happen soon.
So, if your child is bored and you give him the iPad, he'll stop crying, but he won't learn to fight the boring alone or any other way to manage his time and employment, says Professor Fenske.
“And such self-regulation practices are in different situations,” he says.
Your child learns not only to take care of himself, he also learns self-control at all.
I don't think it's a joke to carry.
But it's not worth it either.
You should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Isid agrees with that.
"We see this in a way that we need to experience a lot more of the boredom, while the boredom is a very unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to get away from the constant care and just relax.
"In today's world, we've been used to constantly overstimulating emotions," he says, "and when there's silence, we're lost and we don't know what to do."
While it is not clear how a new law on the legalization of marijuana in the State of Colorado will apply
Anthony Orosko, a 19-year-old football team and a college student in the south-east of Colorado, is accused of committing a criminal offence, which means that soon it will be completely legal throughout the state: keeping a small portion of marijuana and the tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosko said that once in September he and his friends were in Lamar and drove to a car on the outskirts of the border with Kansas when they were stopped by the police.
After the police found out in the marijuana car, Mr. Orosko had come to the drug storage court and had a drug-use adjustment -- small offences, each of which was charged a fine of $100 -- and the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," said Mr. Orosko.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has continued for several weeks since Colorado had voted in favour of the legalization of the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small court cases is not so much dependent on the law as on the place of consideration.
The allegations of minor marijuana offences are already recorded in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, D.C., which has taken similar action.
Police stations have already stopped indicting people at the age of 21 and older than keeping small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as the law enters into force within a few weeks.
However, in the more conservative districts of Colorado, the prosecutors decided to consider existing cases relating to marijuana and continue to be responsible for the storage of this drug.
At the same time, in some cities, from Denver’s suburbs to the mountains of the West, there is a vote to prevent the emergence of new, licensed marijuana stores in their places.
"It's all going so fast that I don't even know what to expect," says Daniel J. Outs, chief of police in the city of Aurora east of Denver.
Representatives of the governing bodies in Washington, D.C., also honor their heads.
They must establish rules for the licensing of the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all of this must be done by 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, prevents most other states from resolving the use of marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
“In Colorado, a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example,” explains Brian I. Smith, a representative of the Board for the Control of Production and Marketing of Alcohol Products in Washington State.
But now no one can do more, Mr. Smith recognizes more than make some suggestions and hope that it will work.
"We don't have the current precedent that we could focus on," he says.
The Washington State Bill, called I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will cast the state into uncertainty for the whole year when there is no State licensing system yet and the right to possession of marijuana is already legal.
There are still some simple technical aspects that need to be resolved during this period, such as how to strike a balance between the state's "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with a ban on its trade at 1000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and children's gardens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana trading companies in the vicinity of the cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs,” explains Ben Livingstone, a recently established research group on the “Legalization Centre for marijuana”.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police Outs from Aurora sent an e-mail to his subordinate that the City Prosecutor's Office would no longer involve those who were 21 years of age in charge of the possession of a small number of marijuanas and that the police would cease to refer to people in these violations as “the beginning of this period”.
The Chief of Police Outs reported that the police would monitor compliance in the city with the rules governing the activities of marijuana growers for medical purposes and would persecute illegal drug dealers and distributors.
The District Prosecutor Wald in northern Colorado, Ken Bak, represents a more stringent approach to this issue.
After voting on the bill, he stated that the prosecutor ' s office would continue to be responsible for the possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage its users to undergo a treatment course.
At present, 119 people have been charged with the storage of two or less ounces of marijuana, although many of them have been accused of other violations.
"The responsibility of our institution is to pursue actions that are considered to be criminal at the time of their execution," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The response was even uneven in places such as the village of Mesa, where voters rejected the proposal for the legalization of marijuana.
The Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the county, no longer hold the juveniles responsible for a small amount of drugs.
The District Prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to record allegations of open cases related to the storage of marijuana.
"I believe that to ensure compliance with the law until it changes is our direct responsibility," he said.
Despite the fact that 55 per cent of the people in the State of Colorado who took part in the vote supported this decision, the inclusion of marijuana in the public and legal system would not be easy.
And the conflicting reaction of the population in different parts of the state has led to the disparity of the local authorities in the state experiment with marijuana.
“The district prosecutors have a cultural barrier on this issue,” explains Sean Macalister, a Danish lawyer representing the interests of the marijuana addicts, and the local representative of the National Maritime Law Reform Organization.
"They have been chasing people for so long that they can't really calm down now that it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states with a small number of marijuanas, are doomed to become an experimental field in the country to examine the very idea of drug legalization.
Legalization partners and state officials are planning to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are demanding instructions from the federal authorities that continue to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The legalization partners of marijuana hope that the Office of Justice will address this issue.
Despite a number of large-scale arrests of traders and patients using marijuana on medical evidence, the federal government has in most cases made good use of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Agents of the Drug Control Bureau are unlikely to enter the house to confiscate a small package of marijuana, but they will hardly be able to close their eyes on the regulated state-run recreational marijuana stores, which are permitted under the new law, believe Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug dealer in Obama ' s administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not expect action by the federal authorities.
Prior to the presidential elections, some local administrations approved moratorium on the opening of new shops for the sale of marijuana, which could not be opened earlier than a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, issued a six-month ban on marijuana trade, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in such a position that we'll issue a license to someone, and then it'll cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still very many outstanding issues.
Petronella White: I was survived from Oxford because I was a conservator.
The persecution of university students for their views has not begun today.
As far as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother were taught in Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogous to the ancient symposium, establishing two foundations of civilization -- freedom and tolerance.
And yet, two weeks later, at the historic college of the Oxford University College at the end of the 1980s, I picked up a comedy and left, which was the first scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand it and cried.
Friends have been beaten up by that kind of thing.
The Evening Standard said I left college because I didn't like my roommates having sex in the next room.
Author E. Norman Wilson was joking that I was leaving because I had to drink from a nice cup.
It wasn't really that fun.
I ran away.
Yeah, she ran away because I was systematically disturbed and scared.
Not quite because of my rather unusual name or what I was learning in private school.
I was tormented only for one reason, and in this glorious educational environment it looked like a barbaric and blind fanaticism: my father, now dead Woodro White, was known as Margaret Tettcher, and I was himself a proponent of conservatives.
You'll ask, why remember this now?
According to recent data, a new generation of law-centered students suffers the same trauma.
This institutionalized and ever-growing hatred for the Conservative students in Oxford was so strong that last week a group of such students needed the same protection of their rights as that granted to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from Corpus Christi College College in Cambridge say that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and forced to feel unwelcome" because of their political views.
They wish to introduce an additional representative to the Committee on Equal Rights to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only exacerbated by a recent BBC 2 documentary on the policy in the student environment "Stern Wonders: Young, Smart and Right" in which the conservators presented themselves to eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Joe Cook was shown in the film, the former president of the Association of Conservatives of Oxford University, who rides in the Rolls-Royse, wears a silver suit and a chest with a silver bead.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they are making “a dropout for higher education fees”.
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the Association of Nottingham University Conservatives, said in an interview with one of the resurrected newspaper, "in the university environment, there is an increase in bias towards left-wing views.
The people who do not know us are before us to be cruelly punished by the children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at Corpus Christi College in the historic college, in which a request for protection was made, calls such an atmosphere “unusual”, and Stephanie Cheryl, 19 years old, says that the attitude of students at the University of Oxford conservatives' Association has deteriorated significantly.
"This is a threat both to the intellectual discussion atmosphere and to the normal life of the club," she said.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn't just in the minority, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, with a laborer and a pregnant 18 - year - old girl.
Oxford was rid of hatred for the conservative party.
A year earlier, the university had given a vote to former student Margaret Tettcher because of a reduction in the budget allocations for higher education.
Even Stalinists would be in such an atmosphere.
On the first Sunday of the first week, when the students met with each other and with teachers, I felt that I had been waiting for me for the first time.
I didn't know that teachers not only looked through their fingers at the grass of the conservators, but they were happy to participate in it themselves.
Political issues -- the strike of the miners, the privatisation and the Government ' s disagreement to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in the UAR -- have been penetrated through covered wooden panels of the auditorium wall.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Mrs. Whitet," said the teacher, now late Harry Pete, "please translate the first paragraph."
Text gave me a hard time, I stopped.
Harry Pete was a very greedy man with a cake-like face.
"Tatcherists don't learn French in principle, or they just don't have enough brains?" he asked.
Other students have been kidnapped.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take some of the early French lessons in free time if you're of course not very busy going back to society," Pett said.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night at college, I sat alone for lunch; then someone grabbed me on my shoulder.
It was James, a second-grad student from the Faculty of English, who was represented as a member of the Association of University Conservatives.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Anyone who is suspected of being in sympathy with the conservators will be seen.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Tettcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most first-class conservatives are supposed to be lobbyists."
Later, in the local pub, I tried hard to hypocrisy.
I insisted on not agreeing with all that Margaret Tettcher said.
The throttle failed.
The principal of the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economy, which he studied in Athens, said: "You are a daughter of a fascist pig.
You're infected."
Other students took his words.
I was a messy, dirty man.
"How do the conservators handle sex?" asked one of them.
- They're kissing each other, right?"
I felt as if I had felt homosexuals before the abolition of criminal prosecution in the sixties.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet the singles only at night?
Will I be forced to become a laborist and hide my current beliefs?
The next three years have become hellish, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for being a adviser to Tetcher on foreign policy and one of its trustees.
He almost didn't show up in college.
He despised it for the provinciality, melancholy and commitment to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took a position as a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started traveling to Oxford from my parents ’ home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unaccompanied city friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his training in the fortieth years, any political views were adopted there.
"But this is the best university in the world," he lamented.
- They can't do that, but they can't do it in the city of the sinking caves...
Even my Communist friends always act inconveniently."
His wet eyes were blinded.
"Don't make any hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you drop the university."
I've been drained by constant visits to London and by my emotional protection of the weak.
My friend, also a conservator, did not resist pressure and gave up his convictions.
The next week, during a seminar, when the ordinary teacher of history took me seriously as an enemy of the people, I decided to do the same.
In my soul, it's a shame, I've admitted that "I missed my parents' brains," and I called them "old fools."
The drive was short.
The last iron in the grave of my career in Oxford was destined to kill my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for Rupert Merdok’s publications.
My door was closed.
I didn't leave, and five minutes later my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I picked up my suitcase and sat on the first train to London.
I didn't come back.
You can call me a plax and a tramp.
But within eighteen years, no one should be subjected to such abuse and intimidation at school.
Unfortunately, it was Oxford that not only issued fourteen prime ministers of the province, but it is still hiding today for the undeserved reputation of a university in which equality and freedom are valued.
"Valentino prefers the elegance of glory."
On Valentine's show, which opened this week in London, ABC is interviewing Nati Abbascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica and other well-known Italian designer customers
Somerset House, former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital to take a exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this at the opening of Valentine's Day, a triumphal retrospective exhibition that combines more than 130 high-mode payments created by his "home" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unrelenting Italian accent.
This exhibition is a final part of the story, the only character of which is "il synore" Garavani, but it could not be written without its named clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world.
In the first hall of this exhibition, open before 3 March, there are personal letters and photographs of the most famous aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga-han to Lord Snoudon, including Mary Chantal, Princess Greece, and Margaret, Princess Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social uplifting: from the modest port of Voger, north of Italy, to the world ' s elite.
To be in love with the Queen's court is nothing wrong with that.
"They don't even throw away their cigarettes on your beautiful envelope, like some beautiful pop music stars do," says Fiona Tischen-Bornemica.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an unparalleled host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all like to come to his jokes in Gsthaade," explains the ex-wife Hayney Tissen, a close friend of the forgotten beauty of Marella Anjellie or Eugenie Niarhos.
Valentino always preferred the elegance of glory.
And yet he's a star.
Valerie Más, representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Maça reminds us of the charismatic model.
Once we went to dinner at his house, it was after showing fashion in the square of Spain in Rome many years ago.
Among the twenty were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, the youngest.
Valentine's style appeared in all of them - in every detail of his apartment, in her clothes, in food, in music.
"Every guest of Valentino's made himself feel important and loved," recalls the "top-model", whose work with the model began in 1995 during the High Fashion Week in Paris.
"He's never out of fashion, because his sketches are the real art," she ends up.
The Parade of the Family
The life of Garavani is a story of not self - control, but of love with full reciprocity.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset-Houses was turned into a glamour podium of 60 meters in length that offers a change of role: the visitor takes the place of the models and is to defile on the podium, the sarcasm of the "spectors" from the grass, which he wears with the heads of Valentine, such as the one that chose Jacqueline Kennedy for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a costume used by Monica Whitty in Nights, or a coat of breast and skin belonging to the emperor Fara Diba.
In this publication, the models highlight such names as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taxisis, Matte-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria, or Sofia Gabsburg.
Nati Abaskal and Modeler, 2006
Many of these clients say that Valentine's first is like love, "it's impossible to forget."
I remember him wonderfully.
These were pants, skirts, "golden" and jackets from the 1971-1972 autumn collection.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Nati Abaskal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him the rest for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former Duke of Fairy.
I like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they come to him.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and legislator Patrick D'Arenberg can't forget the first time she went to Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed I'd be old enough to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally, that time came at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first salary from Valentino to put it on a holiday in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Linh.
It was a red plate, with a bead with the beads, a corsage in the warehouse and a cut without the beads.
"It was a dream that made sense," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is equally fashionable, his passion is temporary," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her holiday payout from the model with "maximum caution... because the payout is not just a payout, it's also a set of memories that accompany it."
"King" Modes
The great final exhibition in Somerset-House is the wedding pay for Marie-Shantal Miller for her wedding with Paulos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 “girls” (as called the model of their swivel) to make this line of ivory-coloured shell with a tuft, twelve species of different circles and a shelf in four and a half metres.
According to journalist Suzie Menques, the highest authority of the specialized press, the pay is a high fashion of the late 20th century, "returning customers from the highest light".
For many years, Valentino has been the best representative of the elite “style of life”.
Kavaler of the Great Cross (sign of the highest rank in Italy), Kavaler of Labour, Commander of the Order of Arts and Words awarded by the Order of the Legion of Honor, Garvani has collected as much honors as any of his clients' wives.
"I've always attracted my attention to his subtlety, his calmness, his exact and unmistakable appearance," recalls d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at the Orse Museum.
He was sitting at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was useless, there is no time for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The world's most difficult profession: fighters with Kawah-Jjenna
Four-euro Indonesian miners risk life and health, weighing 70 kilograms of sulphur at the top of the volcano on steep rocky tropics.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are literally working in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijay, one of 400 hunters who earn a living from the Kawah-Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where the sernish gas rising from the earth’s depths stops in contact with the air.
He puts them in two bamboo boxes, pulls the basket on his shoulders, and carries them up on a rocked road.
Up to the top of the volcano, with a height of 2,386 meters, only 250 metres, but the tested trucks need more than 40 minutes to climb a turtle, with hard balance and careful stabbing the road to avoid falling apart and falling apart.
They know that one false step can cost them their life, as it happened to a tourist from France who collapsed several years ago from the Kawah-Ijgen rock.
Chasteers from Kawah-Jenna earn 5 Eurocents per kilogram of cheese they earn
On top of that, they take the road between the tourists who photograph them as if they were hanging from the circus, and the heavy corsets were lifted, walking three kilometers to the weights that the mining company had heard above, at an altitude of 1,850 metres.
It is about PT Kandi Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, better or less, its employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) per kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocents) of petroleum production, as this mineral is distributed in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of spices, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the marking of sugar.
"As a rule, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per walk," Anto explains, who usually carries out three daily shifts.
It spends three hours each and finally feels broken, but they allow it to store 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a miser for such an inhuman effort, it is two more than he would have earned in the field.
"The daily wage to the miners is very high on local measures, where 15,000 rupees are paid per day (EUR 1.2) and the average monthly earnings equal to two million rupees (167) " , explains the truck who previously worked as a stoner on the Bali tourist island.
Its salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the site was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banjuvanji, a town not far from the volcano, for a major reason that in Indonesia is as convulsive as she is, "I married the girl of Bali, where some Hindus, and brought her to Java to accept Islam."
Anto's asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and he's got eyes on toxic gases.
At 27 years of age, Anto spent three years at risk in Kawah-Ijene, whose cheese has already begun to affect him despite the presence of masks and special glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and he's got eyes on the toxic gases that release the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for his dream.
"I work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
The punishment of life, this pleasant and wise young man could be a tourist guide, an officer, or a porter in the hotel, but instead he does the work of the mule.
As for the dirty wooden cabin with other conveyors, it rises every day at two o’clock in the night, because the cheese does not stop running at night when its distinctive yellow color becomes blue and shines in the dark.
A lot of challenges, Anto goes down to the crater, highlighting himself to a small fan attached to his helmet, which he himself bought for his own money.
Approximately 400 carriers are pumping cheese baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano.
Despite the high profits, the mining company did not mechanize the production of cheese for cost savings and does not provide any equipment to carriers working on their own and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not receive even a portion of 30,000 rupees (EUR 2.5) of the photo collection, which, along with the admission ticket for 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.2), is taken from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its people.
"This work for cattle, not for humans," says Badrusin, a 42-year-old Korean carrier who spent three decades in Kawah-Ijgen, since he left college.
He is able to raise up to 110 pounds, he assures that he will endure “as much as he can” because he needs money to raise his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the serum burns the throat and the burning of the eye, when the wind suddenly changes and hunts prey in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so pronounced that no one complains about their severe diseases... more serious, obviously than their usual problems with breathing, arthrosis, knee pain and sores on their shoulders that have deformed under the severity of the corsin.
By balancing the basket in the back, Uninik can now only raise 50 pounds in its 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions produce 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the warehouse in Tamunsari, a distance of 18 kilometres per narrow drop of growth.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Uninik, wide opening up the mouth, with a few teeth missing.
Of his five children, aged 30, he also works as a cheese carrier.
Time passes, but poverty continues to be one of the most difficult occupations in the world from generation to generation: what human mules are doing with Kawah-Ijgen.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporens accuse the career, stress and prices of housing and education in the absence of children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm a patriot husband, you're my patriot wife, I'll fulfill our civil debt and we'll create life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising of dirty beads, but despite this - or possibly because of this - this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore early this year.
These phrases are part of the rap that uses local proverbs like "Let's put bao (bun) in the oven" to smile at the level of fertility in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, is hoping that they will be able to draw attention to this problem in an entertaining way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to enable people to carry out their “national debt”.
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and fun.
It's a major problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt that it was the subject that we had to touch.
We knew that the Government had been trying to do a lot, for example, to start ghosts with pheromones or to organize fast dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative but did not necessarily work.
So we wondered why we wouldn't do the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, and that's to make a tail?
1.2 Child
Whoever doesn't see it so easily, it's the Government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The public package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 for the child, prolongs maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and highly technological city in South-East Asia, also known as the conservative of its leadership and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population management, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was below 2 is known as a percentage of the replacement in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wey Min, Director of the Policy Office for Spouse Couples and Families of the National Population Administration, said that the reason for the "improvement of education" and the "widest range of career opportunities" was.
"This has enabled people to have a wider range of options for living goals and priorities, besides marriage and family creation," she explains.
These social changes contribute to the growth of the number of holocausts and to the postponement of marriages and the birth of children, resulting in a decrease in fertility in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which aims at a sharp increase in immigration to prevent population decline, is a source of disparity among the local population.
Singapore has web sites where there is hardly hidden xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese people who are criticizing the maintenance of low-level wages and the unwillingness to integrate.
The growth of immigration is also seen as one of the reasons for Singapore ' s ruling party last year ' s worst result in independence elections.
After the elections, an attempt was made to resolve the problem, using quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Effects
While the decline in fertility has a known impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, health and immigration policy, Singapore has also begun to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government is working hard not to build so little housing.
For example, this has started to affect the real estate sector.
The City Development Guide has gone into the control of the number of small apartments known as the "cowbox" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments of 46 square meters are very well sold.
Nevertheless, there is a belief that they can contribute to a hilarious life - style and to the lack of incentives for those who want to build a large family home.
But Lim Yu Sunh, CEO of the EL Developers home construction company, says that their shoe boxes are sold much faster than more spatial copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are purchased for a few days, even a week, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our income is increasing.
However, he recognized that the new rules provided clearer guidance for the devices that had previously been put on the line if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Overloaded
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre, they do not seem to have any special effect.
"People are very stressed, expensive housing, as well as education, and because of this, many people are putting it down," says a young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But it is important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man for 20 years.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress and prices for housing and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as if the Government were not trying to encourage its citizens to have children, as far as the birth of children is concerned, the last word is left behind by Singapore.
Online Personals - Online Personals
Confidentiality.
According to the Royal Spanish Academy of Spanish, it is a private or “personal sphere of life that has the right to protect against any interference”.
What is personal for a minor under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his everyday life and in social networks?
Does he understand the dangers posed by Internet discussions that are unlikely to be shared outside the Internet?
ElPeriodic interviewed five children between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent network users.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", in the personal plane, and "the password and the name of the user", when they applied it to social networks.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't charge," says ten-year-old Jorge, when trying to explain the importance of personal sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has records for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not the whole world," he says.
I'm loading beautiful pictures or pictures from the game on the FB.
I'm also having fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photograph that's not mine, or someone who's acting stupid," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish inappropriate photographs of the oppressed, the crimes or to write insulting or angry comments.
Jorge believes he knows 35 friends he has in the FB and nine of his fans on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother, she has a password for one of the records.
I put on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just loading them," he adds.
"Social networks are entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends in a hurry," he says.
Without thinking, he answers that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't be treated as someone who recommended him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This adolescent has open records on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and recently admits that he does not know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one entered his trust and asked for his home address or phone number.
"If I get pushed or demanded, I'll just remove them from my record," he admits.
José became a successor to Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
Don't be a stranger to the experience of what's known as cyberbing today.
One of my friends was blackmailed on the social network.
He was threatened and demanded money.
"He didn't know who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not delete the record.
"He's only involved in confidentiality."
He then explained the sequence of steps to set the record securely.
Unlike Horghe, this boy would load photos of people known in uncomfortable or confusing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I don't like people or if I want to.
"I want to know it's a cyberbing," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and teacher in education and training, believes that in order to send children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that social networks are intended to be informed.
“The Internet has appeared as a means to find information, but these sites have changed the rules of the game,” she notes.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prensky, professor of education at Yell University and the author of work The Digital Aboriginals and Immigrants invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are those, children and young people born in the age of technology.
"We are digital immigrants who have to teach them while we're still learning," she says.
It explains that this topic is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published or said when maturity is not sufficient for it”.
"So that they are selective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show that such confidentiality to children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
"Tell them not to do this is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell the stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you like to be photographed by someone you published about your friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you sign photos of the party, do you ask permission for other people to mark them?
And yet, does everyone need to know what you're doing at any time?
Another point is to let them understand that they have to go online just as they do offline.
She made the same rules.
"Out of the Internet, a person conducts himself with respect, responsibility and other principles, as must be on social networks," she said.
Diligentity
Estuardo Guardia, a university teacher, a professor of primary education and an education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social networking policies in good faith.
They understand each item and have good reasons for talking to children about the requirements for opening an Internet account.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published," he said.
According to Gaudía, the key question is to remind children not to talk to strangers.
UNASUR Summit ends without publication of the Lima Declaration
VI The Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) was concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier and theoretically signed by binding parties to the family.
The paper, signed at the VI General Assembly of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, had been tried several times, but sources from the Office and the President ' s Administration indicated on the main page that it would be transmitted after the closure, but then confirmed that it would be published at a certain time on the Peruvian Government website.
On the text, they indicated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Olianta Umala, during short press statements.
Journalists ' access to information on the Summit has always been limited.
During the day, only the video of the Presidential Assembly was broadcast in the press room without a sound with a "closed session, a sound forbidden".
A small amount of information circulated among reporters was transmitted by the press secretaries of some Governments of UNASUR attending the meeting but not Peruvian.
The only paper distributed during the day was a list of participating presidents, causing the discontent of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who requested more information.
Subsequently, the administration of the President of Peru sent an electronic message to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it was Umalya’s statement, not the official document to which the summit ended.
Last October, Peru adopted the IIIth South American and Arab Summit (ASPA), and at the same time, despite the insistent demands of the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was not circulated.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure transmission systems for all journalists, but limit the availability of information as much as possible.
The summit was also concluded by a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt a verdict by the Hague Court, which regulates the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olianta Umala and Chile, Sebastian Pinner, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice, which began hearing statements by both parties in The Hague on Monday, in the context of the indictment that Lima had brought against Santiago.
"We will respect and implement a decision that will explain the differences that we are currently submitting to this international court," said Umala, next to her Chilean colleague.
"If there was, and will be, a country that respects international law, a peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," said Pinnera, and welcomed Umalu ' s desire for the flags of those two countries.
The two presidents confirmed that they would be subject to the International Court of Justice immediately after Colombia protested the Bogotá Covenant this week, which recognized its submission to the verdicts of the International Court of Justice following a decision on the maritime borders of Nicaragua, which it considered to be a mistake.
The summit took place in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Ugo Chaves; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Kristina Kirshner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR had been suspended since 2011 following the impossibility of his former President Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
The Acting President, Olianta Umala, was responsible for opening discussions in the morning and closing the summit, to be heard later on the afternoon in Lima.
The Head of State read the outcome paper, which reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects had been approved for South American countries, amounting to $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries would take “the important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the place of residence agreements”.
He reported that actions were being taken to improve “cooperation against the insecurity of citizens and organized transnational crime, to increase the availability of medicines, low access to the Internet in all parts of South America, and to take into account the overall and effective risks of natural disasters”.
As Europe is in crisis, “an economic union (Latin America) should not have a triumphant foundation, but should serve to expand our productive base and provide a better future for our cities”, Umala added.
"We have decided to give the group the privilege of 31 flag projects that will improve the link between South America, especially in rural and border zones... by uniting our countries and creating new economic schemes," said the Peruvian President in a read-in communication.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five were Peru, and limited by cross-sections in its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two were aimed at a long relationship with Ecuador, but he did not provide any more details.
The outcome document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve its re-accession to the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united, and to have a good relationship between neighbours, was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In this regard, President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia said before participating in a regional meeting, which he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortgo, on Saturday in Mexico to negotiate in a respectful manner about the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of the international court challenged by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (on Saturday), maybe I'll meet with President Daniel Ortgo," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the Nicaraguan Pact will require discussion with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are scheduled to attend the new president of the country, Enrique Peña Nueto.
Also at the defence summit, the block ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Plan of Action, which aimed at strengthening dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay constitute UNASUR, although participation of the last of the countries is suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America must learn in Europe about the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common nationality is the goal in which “South America, in this case, must be studied in Europe”.
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told Peru's public television that Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and in other clashes, "as they are now almost one family."
It protected, in this context, a draft establishing of South American citizenship, which was endorsed by UNASUR countries.
"It is necessary to achieve free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still sectors of reaction that wish to bring us back to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador has also shown himself as a proponent of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS), subject to a reduction in the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and to the consideration of those who have signed the San-Hose Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who read the lectures will never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"It is not clear that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said, looking forward to political asylum, the founder of WikiLeaks, assanju, Ecuador.
Correa assured her that she did not regret the decision, because he did not betray his principles with him, but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that, in his time, “there were certain suspicions that Assang would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be followed”.
He also criticised Swedish justice for the requirement to come to his territory for questioning the alleged sexual offence, while “Swedish law alone considers it possible to implement it through a videoconferencing that could be done by the Embassy of Ecuador in London”.
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of deterioration in Assanga's physical and mental health.
"I haven't talked to him since he got to our embassy, but the Ambassador told me he had a little legit problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of State.
What is really there is the danger of deterioration of his physical and mental health because of infestation in a small space without the ability to exercise in the air.
"This affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the asylum issue provided to Assanju since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London was in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European Judicial Authorities, and stressed that there had been negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the infestation of the founder WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judiciary, because Assanza’s lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European institutions,” he said.
And he said that "if Britain provides a guarantee of integrity tomorrow, it will be over."
And if Sweden, as well as its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, would question Mr. Assanza at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or would ask him about Skype, the problem would be exhausted tomorrow.
Correa took the opportunity to prove herself a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that she did not tolerate “directness, incompatibility and lies that distort freedom of expression”.
"The main enemies of freedom of the press are not exported evil-politics, but bad journalists who support survival, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this respect, he remained satisfied that neither these journalists, "no bankers nor bourgeois gegemons do not own in Ecuador", and added that, being re-elected, "will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction".
Korea also supported the decision to preserve Paraguay's veto in UNASUR at least before the next elections, arguing that the organization "should be firm and must not tolerate opportunism and support the conversions under the masquerade law", because in reality "this has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The President of Ecuador also felt that his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos' wish to hold negotiations with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which was in favour of the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty, was “completely justified”.
This decision is not being complied with at this time.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
It is necessary to process them together to overcome them and to keep moving forward.
He also hoped for a good conclusion of the maritime border dispute, which was held in the same court in Peru and Chile, and said that “it is proper for Latin America to address international bodies if two countries are committed to making a decision whatever it was difficult to do”.
As a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador for the third consecutive term, he pointed out that he considered this option “with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes rather difficult”.
Correa assured us that if she won the February 2013 election, she would leave the public.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in unfair situations such as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political authority.
"My political movement felt that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so I had to acknowledge this responsibility," he said.
In the event of a victory, it would be my last time in the office of President, and then we will leave public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
"That's the decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to the treatment that had already been planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean an increase in President Chavez's health," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian State took part today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
AIDS mortality today is the result of late diagnosis
The plant was 21 years old when it was announced that its analysis of AIDS had given a positive result.
"I've been fooled by it," he remembers that difficult, despite the doctor's full discretion, the moment.
Young man hid this from his family.
He decided to cope with the illness on his own, and he wanted to know as much about it as possible, and his efforts were justified - he already noted his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the “older” HIV patients at the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he fell in 1994, with no obstacles.
He's been living with the diagnosis of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) for 22 years, and it would be difficult to believe that in the early 1990s there were too few treatment options, too little knowledge of the disease, too much of the disease, too much of the disease.
So, even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection's clinic didn't want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
In other words, having AIDS at that time was a sentence.
Now it's possible to survive this syndrome and do it, not a bad quality of life.
However, I don't know about my illness, but many people still come when the virus has already damaged their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “the great achievement at this point is that the survival of the patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same”, said HCG, HCG head, Heime Andrade Vilanueva, referring to the fact that this information was confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depend on the level of immune system damage in patients at the start of the diagnosis, with the best expected life expectancy in those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years of age with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years when 500 CD4 is reported.
Simply put, the above means that a person with a 25-year-old HIV positive diagnosis “holding control will be able to live without problems for up to 75 years”, he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be remembered that the life span of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of the patients in the national database have died since the onset of AIDS.
Only 255 people in Halisko died in 2011 and 187 deaths were registered by May of this year; however, it is claimed that there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why do there still have to be a flight exit?
- Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's what I'm talking about, that's how things are in our hospital.
As we haven't had a lack of medication in the last 12 years, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He said: “Ten out of ten patients come when they already have an opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality, so that it can be diagnosed at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for mass detection for all people who will be asked to do so.”
Its proposals reflect the views of experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Halisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who sought to check in a private laboratory only because he had done so to one another and, despite his youth, had already been at the stage of AIDS and had even suffered from a sarcastic Caposha, a cancer disorder that was one of the most common difficulties.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything.
"I'm going to die anyway, I'd better get three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I'm eating well, I'm doing exercises, I'm taking medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of work, I travel, I lead an active sexual life, but with mutual responsibility, I care about myself and another person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO, to encourage those who are now in the context of the World AIDS Day with fear.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible whether they were HIV positive or better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This report summarizes the topic of combating AIDS in 2012.
Can not open message
The major gaps between health programmes and a simple citizen are based on Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalar, who has dealt with HIV-related problems.
And the biggest is prevention.
In the areas related to this problem, “the distribution of condoms has actually increased, we have been given one or two before, now we have hundreds of packages, and this is very good, but it seems that there are those who still do not have access to condoms,” he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why are they for you?" the popular question, with contempt and condemnation, by social workers, school counselors, pharmacians and health workers who do not want to hear teenagers, was assured by the propaganda.
I suggest that this ineffective distribution be amended; that condoms be not only adjacent and that hundreds of them be in cars in public toilets in places where young people often visit.
This is not a promotion of dissolution.
It is not about the payment of beer and motel, Governor Emilio González replied when asked if it was possible to supply condoms under his direction.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those already engaged in sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Halisko
A total of 13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV) have been reported.
The State is taking the fourth place in the national rating on new and summary AIDS cases and 13 on HIV.
92% of the infections are sexually transmitted, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are between 4 and 5 people on one recorded case who do not know.
In view of the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision that cancels the restructuring of the Group of Vitro's debt achieved through competitive production in Mexico, the scenario sets a time-bound precedent for any national subsidiary in a neighbouring country that has payment capacity problems.
It appears that procedures to support the survival of firms permitted by Mexican laws are not valid in the country as opposed to international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of the decision by Judge Harlin Hail on 15 June in the court of bankruptcy of the northern district of Texas leaves unprotected Mexican firms in the presence of the possibility of arresting their property on that side of Rio Grande.
However, the decision opens the door to the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to refer to the United States Supreme Court, proving three inconsistencies.
As an admission, while the judge notes that creditors must be governed by the United States Banking Code, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings concern competition in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of non-payment of transnational profile enterprises.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Harmonization of International Trade Law was established for this purpose, defining the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict states that, without an inter-firm vote, the critical mass of the competitive debt production that had been incurred by the subsidiary of the subsidiary of Vitro before the parent company would not have achieved the majority necessary for the approval of the restructuring.
However, the Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro wasn't the first time this scheme was taken.
There are dozens of examples, including Agrex and Commercial Mexicana, whose inter-firm debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitions.
It is also true that, with the vote of the affiliates, or other Vitro creditors, who fought against him in the United States courts, namely, the funds of the Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not reach the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
These data are being dropped by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of a difficult situation that has been facing since 2008 in the face of the serious economic crisis that has struck the United States.
As long as the Gonzales Sada family will appeal the decision to the appeal court itself, that the vote will be brought to its custody, i.e. five judges, in view of the only three votes cast.
In the event of failure, an application for a certificate will be submitted, which will require a review by the Supreme Court of the United States in this case.
Most of all, the court rejected a document aimed at the Government of Mexico as a friend of the curiae ("other court"), describing the process to be followed by Vitro under the Competition Act, signaling that it was free from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to link it with article 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, that is, the rules established for cross-border insolvency that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Two-board carabol: they're in Vitro and they're in the country.
General balance
In view of the complaints lodged for several months at the table by the Mexicana de Aviation trade unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraud, the Association of Aeroplane Drivers has already found a bottleneck.
The institution headed by Carlos Dias Chaves Morino has just submitted a criminal charge against the National Banks Commission and the securities that is accused of obstructing justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to provide reports to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of the Republic of Mexico concerning an operation carried out by an entrepreneur to recover from the trust fund F/589 Bank IXE 198 million pesos, on behalf of Mexicona Airlines.
Resources would be directed to purchase shares of the Professional Management Company of Otters.
As you know, Ascarrag Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas team.
They're surrounded by Dragon Mart.
As a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of the common civil society, gathered at the Caribbean University Forum, approved the establishment of a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancúne.
We are talking, as you know, about the giant sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean country of the isolated country, with a living area close to 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra had succeeded in bringing together governors of the south-east zone to withstand the monumental forces that had compared the land to some of the protected territories and posed serious threats to the industry.
Death of ACTA
The Government's refusal to explain the circumstances and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Trade Agreement to Combat Counter-Fraud, known as an abbreviation in the English ACTA, according to the Mexican Industrial Property Institute, has already gone into the archive.
As you know, the action has been implemented, although the Senate itself has disqualified the opportunity to view it as a violation of freedom of expression in social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to end long-term debt without having an impact on short-term housing, Homex has placed in the market Burje certificates for 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four identical, offering a per cent payment every 28 days.
Competival appears in the light
Based on NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, information technology leaders, a consortium with a commercial name Competival has just appeared, its goal will be to market software cluster services in Central and South America.

Hettin Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The busy basketball traveler Hettin Reyes was more than 60 years old related to this sport and, thanks to him, traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember such basketball stories as Hettin Reyes.
And before he was brainwashed, in 2008, Reyes was charged with sports for over 60 years, as a game of small categories, as a game of the High basketball league, as an officer and leader of BSN with Cuba Bayamon and the President of the Federation of basketball.
"I have played many roles in basketball for the duration of my life, including several times as I was President of BSN, Director-General of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s," recalls Rayes during a visit to Primera Hora to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate, making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all adorned with photographs and memories of his long journey, testify to this.
Beamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotion, he kept those who remembered his way through Cuba, starting in the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when his 15 years of speech became a co-agent or contract agent.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed most, because I had been able to be part of eight cowboy champions since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or leader.
It was many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, in the year of the debut of Jerome Minsey in BSN.
Since then, the leader has been Cuko Ortis, who has been a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Jean Bartov, who was sent here to the University of Alabama (Birming), said to me, "I have a very strong game for you, 6'7."
"Do you want it?"
And it was the beginning of Minsey, one of the best players who were in Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended the sniper Raymond Gauss, who was born and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsey brought the Bayamon Championship, Gauss would help win another one.
I enjoyed the Kovboev and Gaussian championship, but it was far away because by 1988 it had already been the head of the Federation.
Until then, I have preferred to enjoy his achievements and achievements in the national collection.
I remember how we won for the first time in the U.S. during the 1989 Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we got the fourth place, and it must have been bronze, if not the Canadian judge who had us play the final game, Reyes said.
The 1990 World Championship team is the best collection you've ever seen?
She was among the best, as well as what she won at the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was that from the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and broke the U.S. assembly, which was quite similar to the one that won our bronze at the World Championship.
Not only did Minsi, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and Pikulina (Ortis), but also young (Hawier) 'Toñito' Colon and James Carter, Leon (France and Edgar) and Mario 'Kihote' Morales, who were unable to participate in the 1990s due to knee trauma.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personal composition, but brought us a gold medal and great pleasure, was the 1995 Olympic Qualification Tournament in Neuken, Argentina.
With role-playing games such as Canito Neves, Pablo Alise and young Roland Hurruitner in exchange for short-lived players at the Mar del Plat Pan-American Championship, we won the gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Picculin Ortis.
Its indicators at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as Piculin did.
And it's not taking his career into account in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melandes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From young people, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you think is your main achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most famous era of the national assembly between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s BSN was up to 17 teams in the season.
What are you still doing?
There were things I wanted to achieve, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, boys from Ponce play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in national playoffs.
Now the kids travel and play too much, and that's too much.
At least I see the fruits of mandatory certification and course for governors, officials and judges.
It brings me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, I watch music videos of my age on YouTube, enjoy my grandsons and go to basketball games.
And, of course, I am enjoying my wife's society, Icabel, who was always with me.
Larry Hegman's death
Larry Hegman, born 21 September 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his main role as John Ross Yuing, more known as "J.R.", in the Dallas television series, in which he engaged businessmen without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hegman, whose role as oil artist J.R. Yuing, in the Dallas teleseries, became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hegman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died on Friday evening because of the difficulties caused by cancer, according to the family statement given to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the Dallas production studio.
"Larry returned to his beloved home town of Dallas, playing a role that he liked the most," said his family.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas on the anniversary of Thanksgiving.
Linda Grey, his wife's most prominent role in the original series and in the cycle, was next to Hegman when he died in Dallas, told her representative, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, kind and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," Grey confirmed in the statement.
Hegman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and was transplanted.
Long before Dallas, Hegman got to know about the role of a regular type in the easy comedy I Dream of Jeannie, broadcast by NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
He was playing Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl-jinna who plays Barbara Eden and starts living with her under one roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies who rarely appeared in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included the roles well-adopted by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But that's his master's interpretation of an amazingly disgusting J.R. led Hegman to the top of glory.
The drama series of the CBS channel on the Yuingov clan and other characters in its surroundings was held in the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot in J.R.?", designed to create a forest around the episode, full of emotions in which Hegman's character is not being killed, has generated international discussions and millions of dollars that were at risk in bookstores.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the show at the time.
When a reply was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers looked at it and turned Dallas into a second-of-view entertainment programme in history, following the end of the MASH in 1983, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s cousin, Christine (in charge of Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. prevented her and then threatened her that she would be charged with prostitution if she did not get out of the city, but others had also had reason to attack her.
Hegman played Yuing as an insatiable corrupter with charismatic smiles: an dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who wanted his wife, Sue Ellen, Linda Grey, to be treated.
"I know what must be on J.R.'s grave," Hegman said in 1988.
It must be said, "This is where an honest citizen J.R. Yuing will rest."
It's the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Principal, also the hero of the original series, mentioned on Friday Hegman as "a huge one, both on and off the screen."
He never forgets and is unchangeable to millions of readers around the world, and in the hearts of every one of us who is happy to know and to love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas release were shown several months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The five episodes of the second season had already been completed and the sixth was in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have not yet made statements about what will happen to the series after Hegman's departure.
The native of Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of an actress and singer Mary Martin, who lit up in classics such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Martin was still a teenager when he was born in 1931 at the time of his marriage to lawyer Ben Hegman.
He was happy at the New York theaters in the early 1950s and then served in the UK VV from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist, May Axelsson, and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Haydi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Talll (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I did not include anything there that would think it was possible to cause pain to anyone or to affect them in any way," said the Press Association at the time.
After transferring the fever, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients with fear.
"I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little awkward for a while, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
A course is under way to study "The End of Light"
Every week, students study apocalypse phenomena, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
In this semester, when the religious professor Stuart Sharme decided to read a course about the end of the world, he knew that he had an unmistakable appetite: the end of the "long reverse" calendar of May, 21 December, for which many people were arrested as proof of what was coming to the end of the world.
But Sharme had no idea what was expected of him in the next few months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call the "long Armageddon" and the growing conflict where Israel will be involved, where Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse will begin in time.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," Sharme told students at Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey) this week.
To analyze what is happening in the world right now, as if we had only 30 days left, it was really a good time.
And remember, it's bad for those with apocalyptic thinking.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on the theme of "the end of the light" in this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Templar, Assistant Professor Barry Walker reads the course “Media, Culture and the End of the World”.
Every week, students study apocalypse topics, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're analyzing why these ideas are being circulated over time," he said, and the way in which hypothetical scenarios are proposed to trigger certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war may break out.
This month, the students analyzed films on apocalyptic subjects and studied how they relate to real - life examples.
"I tried to tell the students that maybe it's probably unlikely and impossible," Wacker said.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amar Solari, Assistant Professor of Art and Anthropology, joined to read a course called "The End of Light".
"We don't add '2012' to always have the opportunity to read the course again if the end of the light doesn't come," said Restall.
Despite “necessary destruction”, students must study, prepare projects and submit final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be held in the Canon of Apocalypse, which does not leave students with any choice but to work “until the very night in which the light is supposed to come to an end”, Restall said.
Courses have become quite popular.
"Places were finished in two hours," Restall said about his high-medium student course, which included 35 students.
We received e-mail messages many weeks before the beginning of the semester from the people who asked if there were any more places.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridged Robinson, 23-year-old student of the Haddonfield religious and sociology department, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic form of thought, light or religion, is just a matter of comfort or lack of it.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student at the Psychology and Nurse's Office, said he was watching all the apocalypse movies.
"I've never heard of a course I'd learn from it," he remarked.
I like him.
But none of the students in question -- not about the professor -- said he believed in the end of the light on 21 December.
"Our first project affected Mayan's prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the final course at the Temple University of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it was just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that there was apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which spanned several centuries, where people reacted to changes around themselves, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused these speculations to increase.
"People don't think about it elsewhere," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dodgerty, professor of religion at La Sal University, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly replied to the question whether he knew of any course on the end of the world there.
“The Philippines does not take part in the end of the world”, he wrote, pending the Supreme Court.
We have an apology from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that for a long time the final court had been talking about many days, and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, “people would immediately start thinking about the next date” or to think that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are safe to date.
Some say they're going to the end of the light party.
"I may call some friends to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old college student.
