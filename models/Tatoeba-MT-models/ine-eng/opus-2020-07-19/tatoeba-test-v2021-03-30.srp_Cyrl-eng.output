In this phase of world history, there is no such thing as an independent press in America. You know that and I know it. There is no one among you who dares to write his honest opinion, and if he wrote it, he would know in advance that it would never appear in the press. I have received my regular pay so I would keep my honest opinion out of the news for which I work. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any of you would be so crazy to write what he thinks sincerely, would be found out on the street, in search of some other job. If I had allowed my right opinion to appear in one edition of the news for which I work, I would have been fired from 24 hours.

Do you want to learn something?
We're going to have to walk now.
The girl Pizza and Mr. Kasha walked in the woods.
Anyway, you're wrong.
Rijocos are driving me crazy!
A man has many desires that he doesn't really want to realize, and it would be wrong to assume otherwise.He wants them to remain only desires; they have value only in his imagination; their achievement would be a bitter disappointment to him. Such a wish is also a desire for eternal life. If it was fulfilled, man would become completely sick of endless life, and he would want death.
