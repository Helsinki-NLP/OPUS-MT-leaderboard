Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President
American President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to face the peace prize here as the fourth US president in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a cheque of $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the Northern Metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who selected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The president's couple then scheduled a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony, where Obama takes over the prestigious prize.
He receives this as the fourth US President, but only as the third one who directly rejects the prize in the office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when the price is taken.
The President does not want to dismiss this subject because he knows that he takes over the prize as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
He has strengthened the efforts of the war by sending troops to Afghanistan a few days ago, which none of his critics forget to stress.
At the ceremony Obama also received the Golmedaille, the diploma and check over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to give for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a specific charitable work.
The event programme then features a banquet with the President and his wife, with the exception of the Prime Minister and the Queen of Norway and 250 other guests loaded.
Obama was very slow from the beginning to the price.
For example, he suggested that he felt that he did not deserve the prize.
He also repeated that the price is not only for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as he.
Immediately after the announcement, he pointed out that this was "adjudication for his action".
Naturalists are accused of oppression
The leadership police accused the president of the Association of Citizens of the "Natural Protection Community of Leitmeritz" for their oppression.
In several cases, last year he filed appeals against some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of his professions he asked for money from the investors to his favor, said the chief police spokesman, Alena Romova.
The President of the Lüitmeritz-Natural Protection Community, Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison and he's threatened with a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting mill container in Brünn doesn't smell good
In Prague, people can sort the drinking packages, in the southern Mediterranean villages you can find the sortier-müllcontainer again step by step and step.
And in Brünn?
There, you had to reserve a few minutes to find the right tons of powder.
I don't want to say that the waste separation in Brunn would not work at all.
But I would like to know whether the Councils are concerned enough about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brünn is located in the waste section of the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens here can always dispose of paper, glass and plastics, but especially by the number of tons of dust for such waste.
Have they ever tried to dispose of PET bottles in a collection basket, for example?
This is just art, above all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I've found so far by chance is the marine area against the affected gans.
Mr Onderka is not going to make us angry with his colleagues, but this is too little for me.
Unless the waste separation is also not a honeycomb in other parts.
A lot of my friends don't like to sort out the waste.
From falsehood.
It's too far for them to get to the garbage dumps.
I don't wonder.
I offered myself after the celebration to get some glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova street, I did not see any colour-moulding tones in view.
Luckily, I got to the right place on the road.
But the garbage was almost over.
This is still the center of Brünn, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and any kind of aesthetics are likely to cool down the socialists.
They prefer to buy the city a ice hockey league that makes us in the whole of the Republic of Scande, instead of buying a few tons more of soap and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner well.
I am happy that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics, after having been searching the Internet for a while.
According to the data of the company ECO-KOM, Brünn is actually the worst in the whole area of South-Mähren.
The "paroubek" budget has taken out the money for rent and sickness money
After the left-wing party gave more money to farmers and officials in the government's view, there is no more money in the budget for rent, sickness and construction.
But also not for the public debt or for the international court dispute.
This causes even more problems that will be in the government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists have spent the cost increase for some groups, they calculated that the government is paying extra money for sensitive expenditures, age payments or for the health money. "This is just a rush of the problems in the future, mines," Janota says.
The loans are almost always paid more and more, and you have to repay the money sometime.
Too much to choose where to take the State Fund is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the public sector are not reduced, the tax shall be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the firearm, the teachers, the farmers.
And later on for her children.
To get the rents or the sickness money, which has disappeared from their accounts of 1.8 billion, people must not be afraid to get this money.
But for the price that the State owes itself even more - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state treasury, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will increase so much faster and, together with this, also the costs and interest.
The State will need the money for the compensation, then it will no longer be sufficient to increase the VAT only slightly or to cut the maternity money, as the government did in its counter-ficiency package.
In the next year, five billion will also be missing for the expansion of motorways and railways.
It is mainly the sections obtained in competition, which can no longer be redesigned and possibly be redesigned.
At the very least, get what is not free.
This means delaying or setting up thirty large constructions, it is also dangerous to create European money, warns the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it resolves the flow of money in Solomonically - it affects the CEZ share dividends in which the State is the owner of the majority, and from which the money is spent in the transport fund.
The problem is that the level of dividends is never safe and it is never an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion of CEZ flow to the budget.
Every year, the dividends are paid out of environmental damage payments, the pension account is filled out, and this money is also used as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit by 5.7% of GDP, according to EU rules.
But this does not end the carnival of the revolutions.
Almost three billion fell in the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and for crimes or for costs for the court dispute, even for the construction of the building.
If the state can come to justice without this money, it's not safe.
It's just a game of luck.
If we lose an international dispute, then we have to pay for it anyway, Janota makes clear.
The Minister will then have to save the money for resorts or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
Hundreds of millions are also missing for the already-initiated two-billion-dollar "State Fund" project, which is intended to allow for monitoring on-line what individual authorities are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, warned Janota.
Your next smartphone will manage two operating systems
The Americans are counting on the future with a phone, where users can switch a single key between different operating systems by pressing.
The plans presented appear promising.
It's enough to press just one key, and from Windows Mobile will be in Android in less seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware wants to present, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for the computer.
We allow you to perform two user profiles on the phone at the same time.
They can switch between these, they can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work parallelly, said Srinovas Krishnamurti from VMware company during the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time some days ago.
The market will come in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully run the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, on which simultaneously the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems lived simultaneously.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware works together with the European and American operators at the smartphone virtualization and the customer are expected to come to the customer within 2012.
Snow scarf on the mountains the hotel owners wake up
The snowless slopes are not only the inhabitants of the Giant Mountains.
The lack of snow also scares people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter term including Christmas and Silver.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, fix the prices, but in the meantime they are afraid to order.
And when they call us, they immediately ask us whether, according to our opinion, this year's Christmas party will be on snow or "on matsch", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, introduced.
Anyone who wants to stay in the spindelmühle just according to his ideas should not hesitate with the order.
Whoever prefers to save and where the quality of the stay comes first in second place, he can try to wait a few more days.
The spindelmühle hotel owners currently offer only weekly stays for the Silver Day.
I think they'll be trying to sell them for a long time, but then they'll have to post them, and go into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, estimated Jandura.
Free beds at all wintertimes always offer the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still available.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, led by the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Silver Day in Giant Mountains can also offer the Vrchlabi travel office, but here there are less free places.
Good paragraph also finds the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter term is sold on average.
This year the interest in winter stays is also adversely affected by the fact that there is always no snow in Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the weekend in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are cut within a week, the Christmas will also be sold, says skifert.
Reversed and something better than last year it's been able to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On the Silver Day and Christmas we only have a few more free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The hotel Omnia is also located at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne, 80 per cent for the silver stay.
On the other hand, half of the beds are still available at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne at Christmas.
We were pleased to be surprised this year of January, for which we are already occupied by about 60 percent.
A bit weaker is now February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in the stay in the Giant Mountains is likely to increase, the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, introduced.
The giant mountain hotel owners are currently waiting for a bigger snow protection.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it hits, it should be on the mountains snow.
But then there was to be another warming, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Restoration is Mother of Clue
It is almost comical, with which the student's enthusiasm, Barack Obama, the president, with his reputation as the wisest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan issue, which he himself considered to be the dumbest.
Finally, when he rejected his ambitious Afghan doctrine, it was shown that he wrote it over the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq script for three years.
Not only does he use the type of speech "as in Iraq" in the text itself, he has even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward Way" without losing weight.
Three years ago, he himself criticised the Bush idea - fresh troop quotas in Iraq, which was attacked by the civil war - as "unresponsible and in its consequences karastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy that emerged from the military's recommendations was the only possible and in so far a very successful one that is no longer speaking in the news of Iraq today.
The call Bush was not improved by this, as objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than it was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
The military again requested him to stand up to the troop contingent, especially the commander of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordinating habits, strongly criticised the stunning shields in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to convert the situation to better.
The president hesitated for three months, but no better idea came up, and the general was deceived by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the commitment for another 5,000, even though he himself originally calculated at least 10,000.
The most problematic of the whole Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that half-life will bring the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the Brotherhood War of recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well structured, its leaders respect the values.
The Afghan situation is marked by the counter-indication - no one can be left behind and no agreements will be kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even though they were formally established, remain only lighthouses behind which the patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The lack of interest among the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the uncertainty of the conditions that still complicate Pakistan's and Iran's influences.
The construction of a "actable state", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama's strategy foreign by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and is now at the edge of the explosion.
It is believed that the small soldiers who have broken into the war cry over the "early return" here create a miracle, only a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date set for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, because the Taliban will take this as the indirect opinion of the US defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fights in Afghanistan is changing.
Europe's politicians cannot and will not explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindukush-Gebergspreland.
Another possible factor that can radically affect the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, a very difficult question arises for the United States whether the problem is not to be solved by troops.
This question has to be answered in the period when Obama is fleeing from Afghanistan to America.
But every solution will also mean a dramatic change in the Afghan situation.
The only comfort patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years to the presidential election, so there is still enough time for him to take another strategy, if it would prove to be a total outcome.
The managers of Bank Goldman Sachs no longer receive bonus bonus in bar
The leading leaders of the American Bank Goldman Sachs won't receive any prizes this year in bar.
This has been announced by the company that reacts to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of money that can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be removed from the managers if they act excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters Agency, is at the top of the efforts to connect the Wall Street Awards with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street is aware of the continuing direction in which it has to go, led by the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs turned to the target of criticism after she had contributed almost 17 billion dollars for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonds over the course of this year will probably exceed 20 billion dollars, even after the agency Reuters.
At the beginning of the financial crisis, the high premiums in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries.
On Wednesday, Britain reported that it intended to charge the Beni of the Bankers, who exceed 25,000 pounds, once with a tax of 50 per cent.
Similar steps are also being taken by France.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all fields of science, except in physics.
Five record women today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf accepted this year's Nobel Prize in the fields and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has been awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with her countryman Jack Szkotak, for research in the chromosome field.
The price for chemistry has been received by Israeli Ada Jonathan along with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for clarification of the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics that American woman Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson received for analyses of the economic report.
The only specialist category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao have contributed to the research in glass fibers and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax devices or astronomical remote pipes.
Each of these prize holders has received the diploma, Nobel Prize medals and certificates on the acquisition of the money prize.
It represents ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prize holders in each category, the price will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most expected peace Nobel Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
He has acknowledged in his speech the controversy of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his journey, and is also at the top of the country leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the fight against world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering the retreat. Klaus invited him into the castle
President Vaclav Klaus welcomes the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is thinking about his stay in the government on Friday, because he does not agree with the implementation of the State budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Assembly on Wednesday.
It will be assumed that the budget and perhaps the remaining of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the state deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was briefed by the president, Radim Ochovat.
On Monday, Jan Fischer will negotiate with the Prime Minister.
Under the budget law, which now receives Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should manage with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
However, Parliament agreed on the left-hand side proposals for monetary change on Wednesday and increased the amount of money for civil servants, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of social democracy to cover the budget deficit.
Between the left-wing party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party on the other, there has been a sharp domestic dispute, which is why the issue of the further work of the Fisheries Office, on which the ODS, the CSSD and the Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was adopted by Parliament, is practically liquidated the package of savings measures implemented by the Fishery Government in the autumn and that, in their understanding, it is intended to end the state debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but does not have to, today in the debate with the entrepreneurs, explained that the politicians have neglected the "serious problem" of the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
In his opinion there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only lead to a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is gross, and the government should consider its further existence.
The ODS President, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the office with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
Primer Fischer described words similar to "strong provocations" in the editor.
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the state deficit was grossly that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year and exceeded the 200 billion crowns.
As of Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People's Party was pleased, too.
Mandela was played in the new movie by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claimed that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeatable" of the world shows much of the country, its struggle and victory despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, race relationships and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life story of the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-nine-year-old Mandela if he could represent him in the Eastwood film.
Matt Damon takes on another important role.
I said to him, "When I play you, I have to meet you.
The two-and-a-half-year-old actor who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood Drama from the box "Million Dollar Baby" was already the leader of the movement to end slavery, from which he became the slave holder, a fictional U.S. president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but only rarely anyone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African Stateman was in prison for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic for 27 years.
He was released in 1990 and served as president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeatable", and at the same time is the name of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a real event in which Nelson Mandela joined his forces with the Captain of the South African Back byteam, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people are still racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can share his people with the sport, so he decides to share with the Backby players who belong to the outside world.
Finally, the South African team rises to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela's story to the cinema wall.
He had no other goal than to play this role as closely as possible to bring it closer to reality," Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, eat with him at night and be behind the scenes before his talk.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I shot your hand, I took over your energy, it was transferred, and I felt that I knew how you felt, he said.
For me, it is important to be another person.
Matt Damon is in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national backup team, in which the white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months of time to prepare for the role in the hardback world.
It was a great surprise for him when he first met Pinaar in his house.
I remember when I sounded at the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the film'.
Despite the obvious differences in the status of the actors compared to their actual models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeatable" and also talks about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety Sheet, Todd McCarthy, wrote his evaluation in the following words: "It was a very good story, a very well done film."
In film reviews on the web pages of rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive reviews.
The Russians have tested a rocket.
Over Norway a special light effect was to be observed of unknown origin.
Only yesterday did the Russian Ministry of Defence agree that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
But the start was not successful again, and the rocket, called the type "Bulava", which should be originally the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the alpine dream of the Russian generality as well as of the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site at the rocket test also had no positive effect on the success of the sample flights.
Bulava has usually not been started or damaged in the air at all.
In the Russian newspapers it is already written about "Bulava" as "a rocket that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th trial, which was a normal one at the beginning.
In turn, technical damage occurred on the rocket only at the end of the flight.
Probably exploded the engine in the third rocket level.
This time "Bulava" started from the Dmitrij Donskij nuclear-U-boat, which sailed under the water of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the discharge from the U-boat.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an undetermined flying object over the north roads was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, since the first moment the Norwegians have not doubted that it is a Russian missile.
This time, the generality has defended itself and claims that one cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall out and the third stage was only affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage at the same time.
Even if no test started without error, the management of the Ministry of Defence has only six out of thirteen for failure.
The almost 50 percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism, and it is still claimed that the "Bulva" will fly once without problems, and even up to ten hyperscalp heads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow with 51 years old
The legendary opponent Vjaceslav Fetisov presents himself at 51 years of age in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup holder helps his team CSKA Moscow in need, and is probably already taking part in the Freitagsdual KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career for forty years in 1998, is currently President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another opponent.
Fetisov has trained regularly and agreed to support the team.
We only need some other formalities to clarify, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club by Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only concern a game.
I believe that Fetisov is one of those who can lift the morals of other partners, a fellow leader of Nemcinov.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice level, he will become the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game according to AP.
In the NHL, the legendary stormer Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford with fifty years and was able to write 15 hits and 26 aids.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships, and also won in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he also collected success in the NHL, where he twice got the Stanley Cup over the head in Detroit.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Icecocky Star Room.
Hyundai gave up the trade unions. All over-hours will be lifted
The management of the Nosovice Automobile Factory Hyundai agreed with the trade union to abolish all overtime.
Because of often scheduled overtime, the trade union announced the strike readiness on Monday.
This was confirmed by the speakers of the Hyundai Automobile Factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday's story this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday 19 December, voluntary overtime was proposed on the basis that two work stories would be worked out, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to the employees who would work the Saturday story.
The employees will also receive it in the wake of the Saturday story of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime allowance or they can take a replacement leave on December 28th, so as to extend the Christmas holiday, Vanek took up.
In addition, all employees of Saturday's history are paid the fare and lunch.
In view of the fact that the over-hours of the most urgent and burning point were the demands and complaints of the trade unions who had put up production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the lifting of all over-hours for the month of December, Vaněk started.
The employees of the automotive factory were forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift for another 2 hours until last week.
From the signing of the Agreement, the line preparation by trade unions shall be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unions will take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that, if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they will be ready to lift the race's readiness.
The situation in the car factory was suspicious last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously ran overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged damage.
The management was opposed to the need for employees to make overtime to meet the needs of the car.
The trade unionists also requested that, in their Monday strike preparation, the employees who had interrupted production on the previous Wednesday were not punished.
In the area of overtime, trade unions demand to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they are asking to pay the compensation of 5000 kroner this year.
The Nosovice car factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The series production was launched in November last year.
By September, about 80,000 vehicles were produced here, which currently has 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works with ¿counted ́ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new connections to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the connection to common virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the existing medicines.
The disease of AIDS cannot be cured yet.
Patients may be able to prolong their life and prevent the growth of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a whole series of side effects.
Furthermore, incomplete suppression of the virus increase results in the development of resistance to which no medicines are more effective.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, of the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and of the University of Heidelberg opens the way for dealing with the virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances referred to as metallic carborene affect the protein that is responsible for the enhancement of the HIV virus.
The metal carborene are compounds of bore, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus enhancement in a different way than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists reach new 'improvement' compounds prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the virus protein.
The metal carborene have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-dimensional cages consisting of bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Domestic and persistent virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, no mature viral particles would occur.
If we disable the HIV protease, we also disable the expansion of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe the entire series of connections in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
Something weaker but more reliable
The effects of this series of substances against HIV protease were tested in the reagent glass, including against their persistent (resistant) variants obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of the metal carboran on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as on the medicinal products used, but does not lose its effect on the resistant agents against which the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its other characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical forms, makes metal carbours interesting links for further research on the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, Head of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fighting for budget. ODS went off on Fischer who resists
The president of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, referred to the approved budget for next year as "graveful" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, in his opinion, consider its continued existence.
The statement of the ODS referred to the Prime Minister as "a strong argument".
It is likely time for the analysis.
The vice-chairman of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Office with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party apparently no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to combating the growing deficit or whether it is with the help of Parliament's links for him to remain in office.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the 2010 budget, however, with proposals from the Link Party amending more than 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants, for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of social democracy to cover the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage with a balance of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, so it has complied with the Government's request, because the amended budget is also only a less bad version of the budget.
Disappointment and insanity
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, spoke about his disappointment and a sense of insanity, but Prime Minister Jan Fischer pointed out that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janeto had seriously threatened to accept the amendment proposals with his resignation, the situation would have been different.
According to the Czech TV, Janota signed up for Monday after the government business at the Premier.
He has indicated that he is considering his further stay in the office.
The reason for this is his disappointment over the budget's negotiation.
As far as Fisher is concerned with the further struggle with the budget deficit, Necas says that the nominees of Social Democracy (CSSD) who had made the changes in the budget have nothing to do in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will be retreating if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-creating laws, such as those relating to sickness and pensions or the service law.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by ODS did not hesitate
This is the matter of the Prime Minister and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS made no mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the United States.
It has been mentioned that in some ministries there are people in representative function who confess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fisher decides to refuse to fight the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he is based on the left-hand majority that is currently in Parliament".
Then he can't possibly count on the support and tolerance of the citizens' democracy.
I didn't think about it, and when it comes to this, I'll deal with it, Minister for Defence, nominated by the citizens' Democrats, Martin Bartak told the journalists in Parliament.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS returns to the Prime Minister's request
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in Parliament if the Prime Minister would expressly ask the representatives of the citizens' Democrats to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not appear to be orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question whether the ODS was not repressed in the political debate on the budget by the absence of the Chairman of Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice my voice would be missing.
As soon as I gave up on the mandate, I knew that in the coming months, in particular, it would go to the Bolshevik of Parliament and destroy everything positive, Topolanek responded himself.
According to the new CD (Czech Railway) road schedule, fewer trains will drive at about the same price.
On 13 December, the Czech railway ends or limits some less outloaded speed and local trains; on the other hand, other connections are reinforced.
The total volume of transport is reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new roadmap compared to today.
Most rates including basic and customer fares are not changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area have several connections to the main city, the railway is used for these routes of the type Pendolino.
The train will no longer drive to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less speed trains are also driven on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, basically the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are reduced.
The biggest reduction is planned by the railway in the Hradec Kralove district (King’s Grace), a total of eight percent, on an increase, Prague and the surrounding area can be pleased.
Two night trains are also lifted on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and on a few days a week the operation of some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek route is reduced.
Among the biggest changes are the introduction of the new direct road from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labm need to move.
It is the fifteenth road of the pre-shipment system Esko, which is possible due to the opening of the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labm to Milovice.
The distance to the main city will end at the Prague - main railway station.
The CD introduces more lines of connection SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesennik will be driven within two hours.
With the pendolino, the passengers can no longer drive to Bratislava since December 13.
This year's account for regional railways: increase by 200 million
The rapid trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, the railway will receive a total of eight billion crowns in the coming year, with a total of three billion crowns being paid by the State for the next year.
This year the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains and the high-speed trains, the railway has recently concluded a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railway praises the system, so it may not have taken up the price increase in the large majority of the tickets.
Changes can only be made to a single-day CD Net and to a cheap eLISKA Internet Access Card.
For guests without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiška will then depend on the run-in, until now it was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
More than 50 people are caught in the Philippines who have been released.
Today, Militante kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
This was indicated by the AFP Agency, which initially only informed about 65 exports.
All 17 children arrested were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
There was a kidnapping in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 millilitans reportedly used the hostages as a living shield in the flight to the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to issue the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the militants are part of the Neuvolksarme (NPA), this is the armament of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers because of the violence, which called for actions between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the standard law was imposed because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November, which coincided with the election to the government, were 30 journalists.
Due to suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippines province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But on Tuesday, they resumed the peace negotiations with the Philippine government.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes to the American cinemas "Invictus: the Unbeatable", which includes part of the life story of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
Matt Damon received the role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar.
With the film's start, reactions from critics and the public are also heard.
Nelson Mandela
His name is Nelson Rolilaha Mandela, born 18 July 1918 in a South African village.
In 1988 he received the Sachhar Prize, then in 1993 along with the Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Large expectations are set in the film because it comes to the cinemas at a time, where preparations for world championships in South Africa are culminating, but at the same time, the media are spreading the world's public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and the discrimination of the population by the black majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are primarily positive, despite numerous reservations against the formation of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new film.
From this role I have dreamed for many years and prepared well for it.
Many times I met Nelson Mandela personally so that, as you say, I could receive his energy, he led the interview after the film premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good to remember Mandela's personality and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book presentation by British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that the people have united, depicts the South African human rights defender within his first presidential period.
Morgan Freeman is trying to bring together in the course of the film, two groups of races and from one year to the next, and as Nelson Mandela in 1995, he is also taking part in his role in the World Cup in South Africa's National Backby address.
For the entry of the race in the dress, which is considered almost a holy act in South Africa, Mandela took great ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white audience and thus gained recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship is perhaps fulfilling the task of bringing the people together again into a single nation, led by the Rugbyby player Chester Williams, who was the only Black in 1995 in the national team.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves, it will only show itself.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, as in recent interview for LN of the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The Championship begins on 11 June 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
In the morning, the fire broke out at the transformer of the company Ceps in the Schaltanlage at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
At the fire, according to the speaker of the district firefight Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units were attacked.
Originally, the firearm wanted to burn the transformers, but later it changed its view, and now the fire with a mixture of water - foam and special solvents is removed.
The reason was a technical defect, a transformer-in-the-board lock.
No one was injured, the Havaria threatened, according to the spokesperson, Pavla Mandatova, the security operation of the management system.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will be caused only after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one, according to Mandatova.
For more than 10 years, Ceps has not happened to society; mistakes like this are rare, she added.
According to the spokesperson of CEZ for Nordböhmen, Sona Holingerova, power supply was not interrupted, due to the fire of the Trafostation, the functionality of households, authorities and companies was not affected.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as a single operator of the management system, electricity lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, refurbished and develops 39 switch systems with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred to the distribution system and steering line with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura picks up a fine for slander against three leaders of the CSSD.
The owner of the student agency, Radim Jancura, today picks up a fine for slander against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of Südmähren, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tessarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute interview in the radio journal.
The complaint is linked to the company's efforts to operate regional transport in some areas.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the Rosins, while we only subverted the offer over the scope as agreed with them.
They claimed that we were more expensive than the Czech Railway, because we would know the prices of the Czech Railway, which were completed last week.
That's how nothing else remains for us to refuse.
Because of this humiliation of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he had evidence from all areas that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a case for the European Commission.
Hasek holds the survey of the fine for the further continuation of Jancura's media show, which serves him as a free advertising for his company as well as for his own person.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good names and the good reputation of my district, and I also ask for further leaders.
I take it that it will also become clear in this matter that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the case of regional traffic and uses false and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura had already reported last week that he invested several million crowns in advertising, which would indicate the downturn in the area.
He told the radio journal that he was interrupting the campaign after Christmas, and he wanted to continue it after New Year.
He specified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign started Jancura after the districts agreed on regional rail transport with the Czech Railway and did not issue tenders for the order in a total of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of trains in the districts, according to Jancura, he was also threatened by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we didn't refuse to lose the bus licenses then.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, Jancura told the radio journal today.
Vaccines against pneumococcals free of charge and free of charge
Immunisation against pneumococcals changes the habit from January.
It should be free and voluntary as the first for the families.
But now there are votes that the mandatory impact would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals are culminating.
The Institute of Medicinal Products is already setting the maximum prices of vaccines that are required to pay the health insurance.
The experts are also clear on the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines for free for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals born last year and later on 2 August.
The condition is that they have not yet received a vaccine dose.
Anyone who has started the vaccination in the last year or earlier must also pay for another repetition.
The first vaccine dose must be given between the third and fifth months of life of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of the families had their children improvised against pneumococcals.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
In total, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccine doses will spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year.
However, they save for treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all surface vaccines of children.
The mandatory immunisation was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcals cause moderate torso, but also severe infections including brain inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections cause us to die after a study in hospitals every year of up to 28 children under 10 years of age.
Outside of the Czech Republic, the mandatory influence of children against pneumococcals was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January this will be paid by insurance and will be voluntary.
For example, the chief of the Nahlas Association, Rudolf Kalovski, mentioned the need to improve the impact of the obligation.
Its association is already long-term for the pneumococcal infusion.
The experts at the international conference at which our association was involved were not very satisfied that we had a voluntary vaccination.
That's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have succeeded in doing at least that.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcals.
At this point, we do not consider this at all, said his speaker Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claimed.
The chairman of the company of practical child doctors, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were immunized, then one could think about reducing the number of relapses "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as voluntary," says Cabrnochova.
The experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to improvise their babies against pneumococcals from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcals is also a violation of the fact that it is paid as the first area vaccination of the disease insurance and not by the State.
The insurance should spend the money on prevention to save them for further treatment, Kabrnochova cuts.
The doctors must buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is linked to the care of the practical child doctors involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance and the doctors should then receive them on the same route as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
However, some Members feared that insurance could "make money out of health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for insurance to pay them.
According to estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US artist's son participates in "Museum Steel"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was included when inviting 90 paintings in his vehicle with trailers.
It means Frank Frazetta junior and another man would have used a bagger to enter the museum in the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his presentation of figures like the Conan of Barbara and Tarzan.
As the news agency Associated Press reported, the artist stopped at the time of the event in Florida.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer as saying that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family funeral.
The agency reported that, according to a police statement, Frasetta Junior claimed, he was instructed by his father that he should enter the museum with all means to bring all the paintings into a camp.
The Agency informed that Frank Frazetta Senior objected to granting any permission.
Labour defends state and tax increases
The Ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditure stops, as announced in the Board's report, against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and trade unions.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling would have had an opportunity to "broadcast" to show that he meant it with the reduction of the deficit by exhaling the decisions until after the election.
The treasurer also operates under the authority of a worker with low and middle income.
Its main proposals include a 0.5-percent increase in social security and a 1-percent increase in the public payroll threshold for 2011.
Social security benefits
On the other hand, the unions protested that low-gloh receivers were punished for a recession that they did not cause and warned of the upcoming "problems".
The increase in social security - to some 3 billion British pounds per year - has exacerbated the private sector, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic growth.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
CONFORMITY OF THE PREVENTION REPORT
Increase in social security by another 0.5% from April 2011
This year's economic decline by more than the expected 4,75 %
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
1 % increase in corporate tax for small enterprises rejected
Tax locks for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in government interest by 2,5 %
According to estimates of the treasure, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorer by $90 per year and someone with £40,000 per year will be £190 poorer, while a person with £10,000 will be richer by £110 per year.
The ministers said that their target of deficit reduction by 2013 meant "hard decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would be charged to 5% of the top-payers.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms argues that the proposed tax increases and expenditure stops would be "a drop on the hot rock" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit relief and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party's forecasts of future economic growth – which affects the extent of debt and the rate of deficit reduction – have been questioned after the Treasury Chancellor has been forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75 % this year - much more than the fall by 3.5 % predicted in April - while the debt would be higher by £3 billion than previously proposed.
Missed opportunity
The conservatives, who want to start a new campaign on Thursday to warn Labour's "debt crisis", said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years is unsustainable.
They added that the ministers have failed to provide a credible plan of how they will repay this and "synically" press ahead of difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
"They didn't say anything about what they're going to do," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had their chance to do this, and they've let them go."
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, other than in the conservative proposals, which will see the deficit capping faster and more rapidly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money that will be earned by the tax increases and expenditure stops will be used to cover the expenditure for next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand".
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements - like the above inflation adjustment in some people with disabilities in April - would expose the treasurer to the draft vote, as the money could just be recovered next year.
Labour continues to provide extra aid when people need it most and the situation is re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler State"
Although the Ministers have not announced details of the state in excess of 2011, economists say that the pressure on public expenditure will only come in the medium term.
The recognized Institute for Tax Research said that the figures of the treasurer would mean strong cuts in many areas, perhaps in the future also in the fields of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It will only ease the pain later," said his manager Robert Chote.
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them," Roger Bootle added, economic advisor to Deloitte's business audit firm.
"This was just the high pre-trial state report, and the markets recognize that."
FBI investigates "Festivities of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported US citizens because of the suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an accident at a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandschab province, the American message in Pakistan was shared by the BBC.
The FBI said that it is being investigated whether the same men were reported missing in the last month in the United States of America.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are to be Pakistani descent, one is Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course we are very interested in the prosecutions they are being accused of and under what circumstances they are being detained," said Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said the Authority was informed about the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay, if they are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had already been interested in the house and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men.
The news agency Reuters reported that it refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the United States "should cooperate with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
At the end of November, the five students were reported missing from their families in North Virginia.
Amnesty condemns "mispractice" in Iran
According to a human rights report by Amnesty International, human rights in Iran remains as bad as it has been in the past 20 years.
The report details "disuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report reported that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran withdrew its earlier criticism of its human rights balance.
Officials said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedshad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens were killed, leading to the greatest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
dozens of prisoners and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests by the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, some of the abuse allegations were acknowledged and the closure of the Kahrizak Strafanstalt arranged.
But since then, there has been no tolerance for criticism from the authorities, our correspondent said.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer student Ibrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and of protesting the election results.
"They beat me in the face more often," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my head, on my head ... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and became, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, Amnesty told him.
The victorious presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who were arrested after the election were tortured in August in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities lied about the allegations of rape, but reported that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also called the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained in a prison in Kahrizak for 75 more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the concerns of the government's choice and reactions to it, but so Amnesty, the mandates and powers of these bodies would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks, at least 90 people were arrested in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to turn a mark in Bristol into a competition track.
The ski trails of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money.
At the top of the slope in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump chance at the beginning of a 100 meters long slope.
Student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said that there was a beautiful view from the top of the hang, but it was also very scary.
It's a great view with all the lights in the city that shine down.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some right talents."
Prices were awarded for the best art or tricks performed on the hang.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow will be left to melt.
She's still with us.
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters voted for a ban on mining and the concern about the alleged Islamism of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a well-founded report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most secularised societies in Europe.
Some readers will be surprised to read this new book for the author's last work: "Why the French don't like headsets" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and well-founding study of a question that the country shared and occupied over half a decade and its effects are still to be seen today.
Above's newest book offers a more comprehensive and cooler spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the area.
He spent months in Moscow, schools and institutions that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it "Islamic Free Spaces".
He's a good listener, he's giving talks between teachers and students about the questions they're most worried about.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a councilhouse (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a cine-oriented banking system to obtain a mortgage?
These seem to be profanity issues, he claims that those who make up the daily life are quite different from the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, perhaps with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academics born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who questioned Bowen are mostly united with their Salafi rivals – prosecutors of the purist Sunni Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia – today show a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires both giving and taking.
He asks how much French political decision makers (and the intellectual elite who so passionately watch the separation of Church and State) really feel obliged to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a more severe treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews who had to compromise their historical compromise with secular republicanism.
Rather, he recognizes a "strengthening of value screws" as a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book you tend to say "Yes, but not yet".
The World’s Most Trustful View
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice, which it marks, melts with alarming speed and takes life with it, which can never survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have entered the newly opened water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keelwater.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, describes a natural history of the icons of the north, of the ice bear in "On thin ice".
In the complicated history and politics of the forest, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in the hunt for ice bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an ice bear as a braver 14-year-old Fännrich to the lake, who fought only with the bullet of his musket, is of course a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were captured when they swam behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century showed 75 ice bears in a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically have a million of the living area of a wild animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the ice bear in Singapore was completely green from the algae that grew in the tall hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the settlement continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motorcycle-driving inuit use powerful storms to bring their benefits to the track.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a comprehensive insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
However, this is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries were the first time the confusion of the package.
Undersea boats measure in the Cold War the gradients moving in the underworld.
A useful supplement is satellite measurements and the large-scale launch of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by fearless people camping outside the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the influx system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater salts that are pressed when freezing.
But, beginning from the bear on the ice to the microscopic little wonder in the ice, all are threatened when the summer season is over, which is calculated between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... we could be"
Marine infantrymen were among the 6,000 who landed in Arlington Kränze.
The mountain free De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to put a single scratch on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other marine infantry who took the trip of Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the national cemetery in Arlington to decorate the graves, the day was a tributary to the men and women in whose steps they fell.
In a few months, from where we are always brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay limits on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Freedhof.
Morril Worcester, the owner of the tear-crowding producer Worcester Wraith Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992, when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morril and his wife Karen, who undertake this journey every year, continue in different cities along the way to carry out events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also established a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other states.
In this year, volunteers imposed more than 16,000 border crossings on the miners at the Arlington Freedhof, in areas at the Pentagon, at the cemetery at the Fayetteville National Friedhof in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and at the memorial site for the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation spent for the second time more than $150,000 on the purchase and transport of the border.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she took the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Though her husband is not married in Arlington, Hunt said that this is her way to return some of the victims.
She said that this is a small contribution we can make to support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family funeral.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked across the extended lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World War and Vietnam War as a goal, as these are not visited as often as the newer graves, as the organizers say.
The mood was happy, children played, and couples held on, while they brought the fresh pine branches to the grey graves.
Each round crane was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is nearby and where mainly war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations spent 1,000 borders to decorate this section, but the dark mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals crying openly, others praying and families and friends stuck together in the icy air.
Some read according to the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black and white squares, which were stuck for those who had been trapped in the damp mud, whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who burned down in front of the grave of her son's bitterest tears.
It is 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the graveyard of Marine Infraternity Underofficer David Shane Spicer, who fell in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I've been gone for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractor of the U.S. government of Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor of the US government, who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. with its seat in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers, such as USAID, the US Office for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials of the US representation in Havana try to gain access to the prison, which was arrested on 5 December.
The special charges have not yet been published, although according to Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost everything, under the indictment of the "hazardy".
All the so-called counter-revolutionary activities that include mild protests and critical scriptures pose a risk of imprisonment.
Government-friendly graffiti and statements are considered to be serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to face prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tensions between the communist government of the Castro-Brüder in Cuba and the Obama government, which sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported on Friday by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy stresses that the United States will benefit from concrete steps taken by the Cuban government in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desired products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee are $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed normal citizens to buy a mobile phone this year, they are used mainly for sending text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost a day's pay.
Internet usage is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government sites, such as universities.
Cubans who want to sign in often have to report their name to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in Cuba are in prison for crimes like drug smuggling behind bars, said Gloria Berbena, the press speaker of the U.S. representative in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide any further information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the release of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, which recently issued a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, same Cuba", an application to Raul Castro's position as the country's leader, who replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants would be arrested, convicted and arrested very often within one day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Cover Pakistani government representatives plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities discovered a allegedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said that they hoped that this case could help to discover an excellent network of terrorists who search the Internet for radicalized young men.
Researchers said that they were looking for an impartial rebel, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had invented them because one of them posted comments on YouTube's internet video about terrorist attacks.
After arriving in Pakistan, Saifullah was the leader of these men and was trying to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's Secret Service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince Al-Qaida leaders that men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to submigrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the unwarranted mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered to be part of a hidden operation.
Therefore, they were rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The Government official said that the men were not discouraged and continued to seek the right recommendations to gain access to the Al-Qaida warehouses when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of the applicants in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important in deciding who is trusted.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. Home Service has made it most urgent to subjugate human assets within Al Kaida.
The applicants of the organization act as pastors who do not allow those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and such who might be spies.
American power recruits are subject to a special test by A Kaida, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the NEFA-foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have become much more careful in recent years as to whom they allow access, as the US Home Services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to include someone in these groups, what better way could you go than following the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
The model is now based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators are calling for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded from retailers in the Bella Congress Centre of the city's cooler climate protection.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas police estimates were more than 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists burned small explosive bodies near some government buildings in the city.
On a day when the UN-funded climate negotiations little happened, thousands of activists walked through the city, on which they said, "There is no planet B" and, in Spanish, they said, "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars joined the protest, such as the Danish model, photographer Helena Christiansen, who said that travels to Peru, the country of her mother's birth, make her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country has to deal with due to the already felt effects of climate change.
This is part of the reason why I have decided to take part in the great demonstration - in order to continue the word and appeal to the world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there is no way around it.
The police stopped the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the fact that they were either masked or carrying bags.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a viewer who did not want to be mentioned, since he is involved in climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing have burned several explosive bodies near the Copenhagen Main Channel, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the building, he said and added that they started as light-trackers, but then followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the convention centre, people gathered in front of television screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to have reached the consciousness of the main officials, such as Su Like, China's head climate dealer.
When asked whether he thought that the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he said in English: "That is something I was not aware of."
He went on to Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He found that it depended on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the broad public and various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of others".
Test data show hard-to-sight race gap
Last week the witness to mathematics was welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the schools of the country, the testimony shows that in the past two years, the fourth and eighth classes have made faster progress than the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the hard work gap between African and white students, both at local and national levels.
The average number of white quartzlers from Washington D. C. increased in the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but only about three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American eight-classes remained essentially the same, with a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average number of white students was not included in the test data, as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not encouraging.
The sky, which separated the white and black squares in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points that the children have reached both groups has grown in this timeframe, the difference with now has barely decreased by 58 points.
Some district education advocates last week expressed their concern that the results of the student Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were preceded by the majority of white students, who are still powerful children.
This means that we have raised the overall assessment by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, said, a non-profit group that enters Washington D.C. for equality of education.
I do not jump for a span of two or three points and down, the democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton Primary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of test points is that the city's secondary schools urgently need attention.
Of course you always want to see the positive signs that I respect.
What scares me, however, is that we do not spend nearly the time and energy we should spend on our secondary school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weak students.
In this fall, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new reading plan, the Wilson-Lese system, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary schools, which did not master the basic skills of reading at the beginning of their school course and which are significantly behind their similar classrooms.
Daily mathematics, a teaching plan that takes the lead from the kindergarten to the sixth class of games and life experiences, was brought to Washington by former head school inspector Clifford Janey, and some of the NAEP progress reported last week will be attributed to this teaching plan.
I believe that we must continue to work to bring the best measures to the benefit of the students who are below the level of the score, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and can continue to provide additional money and resources for the weak schools that are necessary to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who investigates urban results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The aim could be to create political consequences that work against this important agenda item.
The point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that they try to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of large schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the urban districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year that is currently 180 days in Washington to compete with the charter schools.
It is necessary to increase the school year for about 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who, with his teachership last year, came to an agreement over 185 days a year that he considers as "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than the future
The bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, climbs out and blinks a moment in view of the white pillars, the brick facades and the emerald green race.
Graciela's parents barely graduated from high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was guaranteed in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set a foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight classes of the group, which explore Gettysburg, where the teaching costs $38.690 per year, was rather a fearsome visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! I will be here soon!" called Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she thoughtfully said when she reported on the low teacher-to-student relationship of the school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th, which the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully accepted the intended message: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children of Spanish immigrants born in the United States who do not end high school or become pregnant as teenagers, on the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands who receive college education that is needed to get up into the middle layer.
In fact, one of the five "second generation" of Hispano-Americans closes the college – which is a remarkable performance, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having finished high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the labour force of the country.
Those who study powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for the school and an inhabitable drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of confidence in American schools.
But consultation programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to get to college, especially if these efforts continue over a longer time.
If you consider poor income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them search through the system, then a single measure at any time will not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied Hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these children from preschool to high school.
The federal program that had funded Gracielas College Tour is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - a step up - and makes more than $300 million a year available for local school systems to start college preparatory programs that start when poor income students are in high school and continue until they have completed high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of whom more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraq's Ministry of Oil concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to bring larger oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure in two auctions concluded on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil indicate that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been affected by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could book only shares in two of the 10 increased fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction that started on Friday.
The only company that has offered a bid has drawn the shorts.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields increased in June.
In the opening of the Iraqi oil industry, the oil analysts were surprised to see the fine-tuned representatives of American oil mills.
Iraq finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of US companies, Asian and Europeans set out the way, Ruba Husari, the publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, said an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, which were still stressed by massively coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability by the withdrawal of the US military have probably stopped American oil companies, analysts said to intensify their commitment in Iraq, which has the third largest proven oil reserves in the world.
US firms were in some cases disadvantaged because competitors, in particular the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, had significantly lower wages and risks because they did not have to account for the shareholders.
Exxon Mobile and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Greater US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhilips, which maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have been sidelined with the technical Council in recent years, have been empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts promised this weekend.
The Chinese State National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, the oil minister Assam jihad said that China is on the way to become one of the world's largest economies and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure itself with its partners and fulfil its obligations towards Iraq.
For the pre-sale fee, selected companies submitted orders that were then compared to the charge per barrel oil that the Ministry was willing to pay in order to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top planner of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In an apparent US missile attack along the Pakistani border to Afghanistan, a top deployment planner of Al Kaida was killed this week, as reported representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism campaign on Friday.
This would be, if it were to be confirmed, the second deadly attack on a highly responsible terrorist organisation this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities, were to be killed by a number of rockets that met their vehicle on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North-Waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan's illegal tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a representative of a Pakistani civilian secret service from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the scene and quickly took everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism led to unspecified evidence that Somalia belonged to the dead.
Somalia was described as the leader military planner of Al Kaida, who led terrorist groups operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in swearing all over the world, noted a leading official who wanted to remain anonymous, and referred to the cruel character of US air raids on Pakistani soil.
Taking its central role as a given one also included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al-Qaida and put them into operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. representative said that Somalia had quickly emerged in the Al-Qaida hierarchy and maintained the best links with other extremist groups in the region.
He must not be known to some Americans, the second representative said, but this does not reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somalia would be the second leading Al Kaida or Taliban leader who had been killed since September when a similar attack by Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other top activists were killed.
The pace of the attacks by the CIA's drones has since summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website of a non-profit organization, dropped from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their accessibility and at the same time brutally kill suspected informants, the site reported.
Head of UN envoys in Kabul Retiring
The leading UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would be retreating from his office in March, ending a stormy term of office, which was crushed by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
Eides is leaving when Obama's government has decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed concern that the US military withdrawal schedule, which was scheduled to start in 18 months, could lead other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of Afghan security forces and thereby send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he was not downgrading his office, but only one of his family's agreements made in March 2008 to remain in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted to notify UNO
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now forwards that he may have time to make a replacement.
What I've said is that he's starting to look for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban started looking for a replacement, according to UN representatives.
The UN representatives say that he considered the Swedish-Italian-strong staff of Mistura, who had recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and had taken into consideration the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who had previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eides position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy Peter W. Galbraith accused him in September of preferring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and losing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all charges, but he also said that the charges of Galbraith - who was fired - "the mission has undoubtedly suffered damage because there was already a large amount of schepsis in relation to international involvement in the election".
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the assistance measures of the US-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership allow its successor to recruit more staff from the United States and other Western countries who contributed to the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the current UN settlement regimes had undermined his ability to bring in people capable of doing so.
The UN rules are so designed that since May, he said only one person could set up.
This is a disaster and must not go on like this.
U.S. Defence Minister Gates: Iran must count with additional sanctions
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon be subject to "significant additional sanctions" over Iran because he did not participate in talks about his atoms.
Gates spoke to a group of approximately 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq during a 7-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, and played the view of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good options to choose, he said in response to the question of a soldier's probability of such a development.
"One of the things that lie in my soul is if we've learned something from Iraq in the last six years, that the war's own unpredictability."
The Obama government is considering a sanctions package aimed at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said that "a package of positive and negative incentives" was needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is in reality less protected by nuclear weapons", because "his people will suffer indiscriminately" under the sanctions.
On Friday, an opinion by the speaker of the White House, Robert Gibbs, joined the American government in warning European top politicians that Iran must face "cruel" consequences if it fails to comply with the requirements of the UN Security Council and its Atomic Monitoring Organization, the International Atomic Energy Authority, with its nuclear programme.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should be gained only for peaceful purposes.
In discussions in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume the talks to restrict its nuclear programme and would ignore a substantial part of its stockpiles in the exchange of urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has urged this kind of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to earn time for negotiations.
However, since that time, Iran seems to have left the negotiations to the provisional agreements -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership has no problem whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply left the international community in relation to some of the proposals which it had already agreed to in early October has openly said that the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, has brought together in a way that it has never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran.
President Obama set the 31st December as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those once called "pressive sanctions" by Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton.
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian representative of the United Nations condemned what she called on some members of the Security Council on Thursday "unfounded and unfounded claims" to the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they were ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was supposed to return to Washington on Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he fled to the mountainous Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, especially with regard to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates forced both sides to lower the conflict potential to prevent delays in US plans, to lower US troops by the end of August from 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to dissipate Kurdish concern over the imminent withdrawal of troops. U.S. representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government, said: "We will receive your security, well-being and autonomy within a single Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A Change of Course in Older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them talks that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
These lessons learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change the course and encourage young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and final: "No case".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child, nothing else is left, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of a child policy in China, which has emerged from two generations of notorious, derogatory individual children, who are lovingly called "small emperor", a population crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate is 1.8 children per pair compared to 6 at the time of entry into force of this policy, the UN.
Division for Population Issues, while the number of population groups aged 60 years and older in 2020 is expected to rise to 31.1 per cent by 2050. This is far above the global average of approximately 20 per cent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated people, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and olders accounted for almost 22 percent of the reported inhabitants of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below one child per pair.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that couples in the productive age of babies need to "help to reduce the proportion of older people and to reduce the shortage of workers in the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- however not as rich -- as the industrial countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
In the constitution of the country in 1978, China's a child policy should be the most controversial provision introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Couples who break this policy must face enormous financial penalties -- up to their three-fold annual rate in some regions -- and with discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese representatives of the state have attributed this policy to the fact that the critical demand for natural resources could be avoided, thereby condemning human rights abuses in the implementation of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to drive away.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards a child policy.
In 2004, they accepted more exceptions to the rule -- including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife were single children -- and the tone of many hard slogans was reported in 2007.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, allowing couples to have two children with whom a single child is a partner.
Shanghai was the first Chinese city in July to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
The posters, which taught families to have only one child, were replaced almost overnight by directives that describe in detail who comes in for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent urban employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and move information sheets under the doors.
She also asked for psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not just encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Depressing reaction
Although officials from a small rural town in the external areas of Shanghai said that a rise in the requests of couples who want a second child after the campaign begins, the urban districts do not notice any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, for example, only four to five applications are still per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births expected in the city for 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Shanghai Family Planning Committee in the municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want any more children.
They want to give their first one the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and this is also lawful.
But they have, like many Chinese, only a small amount of health and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say that this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West value a child policy falsely as a human rights question, Yang said, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we're robbed of the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their delay.
Wang, the staff leader, said she only wanted a child, because she was also a single child. "We were the family's center and used to worry about each one of us.
We are not used to caring for others and we do not really want to do this."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it unmistakably.
For parents from the middle-class with a double career through which the birth rate decreases, he said it turns out to be successful and you have to be selfish about it.
The age group of today's 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they didn't want a life like that for themselves, he said.
Also, a single child, he said, places enormous demands at the time of parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you must have already prepared a life course for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to do this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
UNO Group drafts emission reduction plan
The UN-funded climate conference -- which has so far been distinguished by wild poses and mutual accusations -- has again put a focus on the publication of a document on Friday with the publication of a document, which will record an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas for the next 40 years, with the need for industrial nations to shoulder the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas management has demonstrated both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step in a negotiation that takes time, as more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive next week in Copenhagen.
The text, which was formulated by a separate UN working group for that purpose, is about the amount of money that the rich countries should give to the poor countries so that they can master global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large-scale countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature increase that political decision-makers would contribute.
The process will provide great flexibility, according to John Coequitt, the lead representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has drawn up the six-page document, has compiled a 180-page long negotiating text to focus on what the leading climate protection representative of the UN, Yvo de Boer, referred to as "the great whole".
It shows the basis for a possible agreement whereby the industrial nations together would reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent by 2020, compared with the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent at the same time.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given talks on Friday a boost through its assurance to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from the master of floods and droughts to the prevention of deforestation.
On Friday, however, the same verbal fireworks that had determined the discussions last week.
The US Climate Commissioner, Todd Stern, has rejected formulations that call for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, unless they are financed by the industrial nations.
This train announced that Obama's government is leading a tougher line with China than the Bush government's representative not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without larger emerging countries taking action, such as stars, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his opinion an hour after the Chinese Foreign Minister He Yafei declared that it was either a lack of "soundness" or a lack of understanding by the leading US air traffic controller or a "highly irresponsible" of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States of China would not help financially to master global warming.
Because the future economic direction of the great world powers is at stake, both within the industrial nations and between the industrial nations and between the emerging countries have broken lines.
The current struggle also refers to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States acting on their respective obligations, while poorer countries claiming that the two most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the large powers were fighting to bear the costs of braking the greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have gone beyond that, aggressively taking into account the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions for their actions.
This is clearly a game in which a new economic predominance will develop, such as Ulate, who is also acting as regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most affected by climate change indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants said that the talks would best lead to a political agreement.
The Alliance of the Small Islands with 43 members submitted a 24-page draft contract on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who conducts the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensives of the small island states "implemented political pressure on the whole political process", partly because they are now united and demand action from the emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks received a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open issues still need to be clarified before the government leaders arrive to reach agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister of Justice, drove their aircraft and ran through the halls of the Bella Centre to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to cover claims that will be negotiated during the next week.
The pure extent of the assembly -- 13,000 people go to the Congress Centre every day, and guitar-responsive activists organize night shows, where they joke about the countries that betray and sell their opinion, and hand-to-hand drafts instead of e-mail, are already challenging.
The intensity is only built on: almost all important ministers are now here and since Wednesday 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of Global Policy of the Organization of Conservation International.
The weights come.
Britain's first 225 km/h fast train defines the feeling of Monday new
On Monday morning at 5:13 a.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce an addendum that represents a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed high-speed train in the country will reach Asfort, Kent, after London St. Pancras 225 km/h and lie 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Dame Kelly Holmes will be on board the first Javelin pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will finally be connected to an international rail network of faster, reliable trains and connect the large landing areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living cities of pendants, working hours would be reduced radically, and the exchange of aircraft and cars on the train would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the streets.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fear of environmental damage could still bring the brakes to the British high-speed tracks.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, Lord Adonis will submit the report on 30 December, according to the Times.
This gives it a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line to connect London with the West Midlands will be crossed with a five-metre playing space in urban areas and in places where the environmental impact is controversial.
In the open area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final route.
HS2 is also intended to create three options for a larger, north-east leading high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is an Y-shaped route where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would be shared in or near Birmingham and a retreat would lead west of the Pennsylvania to Manchester and Scotland and another towards Northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-functioning option," said one railway-insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first partial route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow the travelers to return the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today a little over an hour.
The drafts offer trains the possibility of driving at a speed of 400 km/h, which would make the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was designed so that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can ride on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This would mean that in London a final station would be necessary, on which 20,000 passengers could be made per hour.
In view of the spatial constraints in the capital, an existing railway station is expected to be expanded in order to undermine the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan should be continued, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he puts the wheels in motion, the rail network needs to be built in sections.
First, the trains had to switch from high-speed lines to existing rail routes in northern Birmingham, which would keep the journey between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is a crucial point in order to ensure a change from the aircraft to the train, a guide for the rail revolution.
Tax returns for mortgages for 75,000 pounds of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leader of the conservatives' sub-house, has taken into account the tax collector's thousands of pounds per year for the cost of an orange that he is building in his home in his constituency.
The jailer of the party, who was degraded by David Cameron because he complained that sub-house members had to live "from lean rations", increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to build an oak-wood plant at his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to account for the additional interest income to the taxpayer, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
At that time, the sub-house officials approved the applications and they were not asked by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenses of the sub-house members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could have been "not yet more clean or understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest under-house members, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency Rutland and Melton.
Houses nearby have reached a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, a publishing office of the basement, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he planted a winter garden called "Orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not invited by the Committee on Standards and Privileges to comment on the increase in the amount of money during a recent study of his previous mortgage contracts.
The Committee released it last month, following an examination of its expenditure, on the violation of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security of a mortgage of over 271,406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house to his constituency, which he had purchased a year before his election as a member of Parliament.
This week's published documents show that Duncan received about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as a mortgage refund by March.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncans RBS-Hypothek has not changed during this time, which shows that the total increase was used to finance the collection of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal phaseless RBS hypothesis fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the Sub-House show that Duncan continued to apply to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month in May.
Duncan lost his post in September as opposition leader of the Undercover House after filming him when he said after the issue scandal that members of Parliament would live "out of lean rations".
"In essence, it means working for the state that you have to live by lean rations and how S*****e is treated."
He said, “I have spent my money on my garden, and I am demanding a small part of what I hear.”
And I could have asked for the whole damn sum, but I'm not doing it."
The Parliament member, a millionaire from his earlier career as an oil dealer, was first attacked for his expenditure in May, when it became clear that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden before he had concluded with the Fees Office that this could be considered "as an excessive demand".
As a protest activist in Duncan Rasen, a hole was dug in the form of a pound sign, after being known that he had requested 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years away.
When he was questioned last night about the increased mortgage, Duncan said, "This was both from the Fees Office, and the following was approved by law for the rise in value."
He added: "There is no debate on deviations and lengths or any interference with the rules or similar.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be cleaner and clearer."
Comes all your believers to admire Brighton's Strandhütten Advent Calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new content of life for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that stimulates spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the latest cottages every day from 17:30 to 18:30 at free wine and traditional mince pies, filled with dried fruits.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", while here the hidden decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Howe, is an honorary spiritualist of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we expect people as a church to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and have exciting celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut adventure calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and living place and we are trying to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide on Saturday and in Copenhagen to seek an ambitious and binding agreement on combating climate warming, where the police have held several hundred arrests.
At least 30 thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands of organizers, are marched into the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion that could enter into force from 2013 until Friday.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the increasing mobilization in the world for the climate contributes to what these demonstrations show would be very high the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen.
The interim events in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, had broken windows with plaster stones and hammers, a journalist of the AFP stated.
Anti-injurious policemen have attacked immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your assessment, are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitter groups, who have already become famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has captured the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters were "no distinction", sharply criticised, and stressed that about one hundred of you "were still stuck in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and position.
The more peaceful train took place from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the scheduled speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators were driven by buses and trains from large European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with blue raincoats, have made a first tour in Copenhagen in the morning, as you are following the call of the Earth's friends to form "blue seasons" for the "climate justice".
Today we go on the streets to demand a reorganization of the ecological debt in favour of the south, Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen, explained.
We can't go on and tell ourselves: we have time, Angelique Kidjo meant, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, where water flows can be walked, just as there has never been a case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalising critics has approached environmental organisations.
European Commissioner José Bové, like the Globalisation Critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pacific space, where many islands are at risk from warming, has provided the starting shot for the demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people have gone to the streets according to the organizers in Australia.
In Manila, there were a few hundred people, mostly students marching in red and hating bandanas, in which you have glorified the sun energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, a number of hundreds of demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered a few hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia complains that it is a strike here.
Abkhazia elected his president on Saturday, which happened a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as being self-recognised, Tbilisi denounced the strike.
About 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of the South-Ossetian region, another Georgian secessionist area, recognised by Russia.
The lobbys closed at 5:00 GMT.
The electoral participation was about 58% a few hours before the vote was closed, according to the Abkhazia Election Commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced on Saturday night on Sunday.
The five candidates, including the former president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of a reunification with Georgia that condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, said that Abkhazia is now under Russian total control, his press speaker, Manana Manjgaladze, said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
Having separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with a number of thousands of people dying, Abkhazia wanted to prove by this election that it was ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Lord Bagapch, has explained.
She was one of the electors who went to choose a lobby in a school in the capital Soukhumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees before the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs on which the Bagapch can be seen on the side of the Russian President and the head of government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216 000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is on the east side of the country, the District Chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhazia people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an appeal to Moscow's support, in particular with regard to the decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, replied and raised a glass of wodka.
The opposition, represented by the former vice president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements that had been reached with Moscow in the previous year, as those in Abkhazia Russia left control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims neither to support the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Intermediate events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide on Saturday to seek an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, at any time ready to use, have captured about 700 people, at the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to police, hundreds of thousands of organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which until 18 December receive delegates from 193 countries seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators have stopped about 500 meters from the center and have not tried to interfere.
A stage was built to welcome the scheduled speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators who were completely dressed in black and armed with backstones and hammers began to insert discs, a journalist of the AFP stated.
Anti-injurious policemen have immediately attacked you and attacked you without regard by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that between 600 and 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mostly members of "the Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent splitter groups that have already been famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
On the other hand, in the meantime, a police officer who said that about 20 people had been arrested provisionally suffered an injury by a plaster stone. Four vehicles were burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups in the grip," explained the police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces were screaming in the air.
Most demonstrators travelling by train or by their own vehicle from German cities, from London, Amsterdam or from Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the blue raincoat, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group to represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we go on the road to demand that the ecological debts be repaid to the people of the south," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say any more : we still have time," says the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that ravage, there are watercourses through which one can run, which was never the case before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the counter-globalisationists has approached environmental protection organisations.
The French Member of the European Parliament and Globalisation Critic José Bové explained to the AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice." "There is no difference today between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christians or former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turns to the masses.
The Asian-Pacific space, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given rise to an attack on the demonstrations.
In Australia, about 50,000 people went to the street following the words of the organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed red with bandanas, made advertising in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organized by the network of 350, several hundred people, especially in Paris, Marseille in the South, Lille in the North, Bordeaux in the West and Lyon in the East, joined together.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
The fields of geography and history, according to Chatel, emerge strongly from the school reform of the lycées.
National Education Minister Luc Chatel explained in an interview, which appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du Sunday", that the topics of geography and history are strongly reflected in the school reform of the lycées, even though they are not mandatoryly taught in the terminals (12th year of school).
"The students of the Première (11th school year) now have all four hours and the same program," says Mr. Chatel.
For the Minister "must be overcome by this holiness", because after him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in large and completely a concentration "the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientist," he continued. He stressed: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who have been emboldened by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lycenes."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité found that nearly seven of ten French (69%) criticise the state project of deleting compulsory teaching in history and geography in the Terminal S (12th year of school with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals are also involved in this project, as well as the links and some representatives of rights.
The Minister replied, however, that there was no question about the restriction of the philosophy of the programme of Terminal S.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) for Tuesday called for a protest against the project, which she considered would fall victim to the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister explained that they were subject to Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year of a specialist fitness examination and at the end of the year of an authorisation examination, in which their teaching skills were tested.
They also conduct practice during the year in M2 and then teach a year before the students as teachers in practice.
He continued: "If you add all the practices offered before the performance test, you will reach even more hours that you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the Minister stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "things that does not exist in education."
He once again confirmed that he wanted to cancel the school card "until 2012.
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the use at the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge Jean Jouzel, Vice President of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change", had to deal with at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris on Saturday morning.
As a journalist of the AFP found, peace Nobel laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the Ernest conferences, where experts turned to the public for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
You want to do something to reach people and make them feel better, Edouard Hanneszo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, said on the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the names given by the students to the fish at the school's pool.
"Of the experts, the twenty participants were selected, even after their charisma," he specified.
"You can talk for hours about climate warming, but the core objectives can also be presented in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke only with the help of foils before about 50 people.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in his hope that the audiences would like to learn that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos filmed by these conferences will be available online on the school side from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Payment delay : angry prison sentences, planned actions
The unions of law enforcement officials called on Friday for a general day of action to ensure that the awards and overtimes for which payments have been made for budgetary reasons until January will be transferred before Christmas.
The 2nd union of criminal law enforcement officers ("FO-Penitentiaire") called on the employees who did not have a service to demonstrate on Tuesday before the criminal law enforcement office and block them to pay attention to the "threat of what belongs to them".
The 3rd union of criminal law enforcement officials ("CGT-Penitentiaire") called for "to join a strong mobilization in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of the overtime, night supplements, and the sun and holiday allowances in December is marked as "silent and unacceptable".
The first trade union of criminal law enforcement officials, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the Criminal Service and the Ministry of Justice explained that the overtime was high in 2009 and not all were provided for in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As stated by the Ministry of Justice in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie has sent a letter to the trade unions of law enforcement officials guaranteeing payment in the coming month.
"I know very well about the efforts of staff to keep our criminal system functioning and modernise," the Minister of Justice explains in this letter.
"I have instructed the head of the crime court to take immediate action to ensure that a situation which has arisen due to the lack of assessment of the overtime is not repeated in the future," added Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December pay is thus lower, except for the management staff who benefit from high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA explains for which the "costs" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal", the interregional FO trade union in Marseille urges "all collections and calls" to boycott new directions.
"The staff will not go to work on Sundays and holidays if the hours of October are still not paid in December. This is also true of their overtime", the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
"In a time when more and more tasks are being assigned to us, without more staff being set up, the attempt is to enrich the staff's money, more than inadequate," says the CGT Association of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
However, in any case it is wrong, the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget, notes.
Obama is the view that he shares Christmas gifts always better than he gets himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend the first Christmas with his family in the White House, has announced to the TV speaker Oprah Winfrey that he always shares better gifts than he gets himself.
The president and his wife, Michelle, gave an insight into how they will spend their holiday in their new illustrative home on Sunday evenings.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," confirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog will also receive a gift.
Michelle Obama decided to return her husband's claims to the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she denied the president.
"So please," he scolded her and pointed out to First Lady's pearl chain: "And who gave this to you?"
During this one-hour exposure in an uncompromising atmosphere with the well-known television moderator, Barack Obama, who had so strongly supported during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts she loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bike with ten walks and also a basketball that his father had brought to him, which he rarely saw, at Christmas in Kenya.
"I remember when my father visited us once Christmas and brought me a basketball," the president said.
"For a long time later in my life, I realized that I had this ball from him."
First Lady reminded her of her doll house.
"I didn't even know how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperatives, RTL confirms that he was transferred to the artistic coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles due to significant "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was put into artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was again operated on Wednesday night from Thursday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, after the American doctors "damaged by the operation of a tape tape incident", which he had suffered in Paris on November 26, so his production company in Paris, who added that these damage had made a new operation necessary.
The singer's production company, however, wanted to clarify the situation as "under control" and informed that a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, however, Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma to avoid "sickness and complications".
However, only 48 hours later, RTL was added to the patient’s condition when he opened his eyes.
At the request of the AFP, there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources", that after his first operation in Paris was "no more drainage".
The rocker was operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a tape incident.
The surgery planned over several days was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday night for comments against RTL.
After Johnny Hallyday's operation, the singer was delivered to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital on Monday in Los Angeles due to a follow-up infection after surgery.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, was compared to RTL on Thursday to the view that his friend was just going through a "deep valley". He assured, however, that one needs "no worries" to make the rock musician, since this is "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him it was a bad idea to put himself in a plane for 12 hours after such an operation, which doesn't go that way," Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer Jean-Claude Camus confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well on antibiotics" and that "infected" was.
Mr Camus also explained that he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he felt no particular dismay.
Nevertheless, the care for the health of the singer has increased ever since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after being disturbed on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise of the speech that Johnny Hallyday had had a "small intestine cancer-OP", which resulted in a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer took his long " Tour 66" as a separate tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented out. Fans and journalists have not gone away that the singer had difficulty moving on stage.
First, in mid-November, the people surrounding him had to dementate a new delivery to the hospital.
Euro-2009/shortway: First place for Bousquet about its favorite distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 swimming world championships, won an international title on his favorite distance, 50m freestyle, on the Euro-2009 short track in Istanbul on Thursday.
On the first day of this competition, on which the polyurethanes were last allowed, there were only three world records, while a true record flow was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Surprised over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m layers of the men.
Damage for Bousquet, who wanted to take after the world record at the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big bench (20.94).
At one of the two king's distances in the swimming, 50m-freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the beginning (usually there are eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatians Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russians Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe more and more and more, and in the present case, if the world record is within my reach, I will try it."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits that are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 World Records since February 2008, these combinations ended their Epos in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination has not been paid this time for the German Paul Biedermann, twice world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and World Record, at the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has spent the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danes Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I haven't given everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my job."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann explained.
USA : grave plate at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman grave plate, which was calculated by the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated on Thursday at 1.5 million US dollars over its value, as Sotheby's art dealer.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the third century after Christ and has always been valued with 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of dionysus are depicted in a sophisticated architectural decoration, surrounded by satires and bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," explained Florent Heintz, Vice President for the Protection of Roman and Egyptian Antiquities at Sotheby's, on Tuesday against the AFP.
It was sold in hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still in progress, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered the most for so far," says Sotheby's spokesperson Dan Abernethy against the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of marble by Emile Zola goes far back.
The album was almost 300 years old in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family home, then she played pieces for pieces with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who found use in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshall Petin came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of a "Erbage of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's exit attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been eliminated
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the oppressed Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soils as no longer compatible, after this leadership had rejected the Putsch government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place at night, it seems to me that there is a disagreement about the possibilities of this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, explained.
According to the immigration authority, the plane entered by the Mexican government on Wednesday in Salvador for the purpose of the transfer of Mr Zelayas was returned to its original location.
The Putsch government wanted Mr. Zelaya to be "thank you" and to seek political asylum for him abroad.
The President, however, refused this because he wished to return to Mexico as the host, the head of state.
The Putsch regime "has suffered a renewed failure by wanting to give up on my costs (...), they wanted me to give up," said M. Zelaya on Thursday, against Radio Globo, where he often reportedly since the beginning of the political crisis in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here well and enjoy ten years, here I have my guitar, added the offended president who had fled to the Brazilian message of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago under attacks.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, since it does not include a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of Interior of the Putsch government, told the Honduras Radio HRN on Wednesday.
In no country of asylum, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the Telesur channel, which is located in Caracas.
A possible exit from Honduras, as he had stressed, would only be the president of the Hondurasan people.
The announcements about a trip by Mr. Zelayas had mobilized on Wednesday the followers of the offended president, who had risen to the Brazilian message and gathered around it, which strengthened the military's use there.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the Putsch government.
This, in his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the light of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was tortured on 28 June, on the day of the national inquiry organized by him to prepare for his re-election against the Council of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he was surprised to return on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves this, he will be arrested for being a high-level judge, so the Putsch government.
The Putsch President Roberto Micheletti managed to organise a presidential election on 29 November to resolve Mr Zelaya.
In the course of the contested election, Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States, but rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street on the rise, the US trade balance nourishes optimism
On Thursday, the New York Stock Exchange concluded with a high, the figures of the US trade balance show a discount of the shares of the United States and its partners: Dow Jones awarded 0.67%, Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the figures in the stock exchange, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased from 68.78 points to 10,405,83 points, the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, from 7,13 points to 2,190,06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor ́s 500 index was described by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There are good news from different industries, judged Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market focuses only on "half-glasses", so she measured.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily focused on the figures of the US trade balance, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The trade deficit of the United States fell by 7.6 % in October compared to September to $32.9 billion.
On the contrary, the analysts had calculated a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The great novelty is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, reflecting the economic growth of the United States' main trading partners, as commented Christopher Cornell of the Business Research Economy.com.
In contrast, unemployment reports in the United States have increased in the last week against all expectations and have now reached the level of 474,000 applications.
However, the average value of new jobseekers over the past four weeks has been "falling at the bottom of the year", said Scott Marcouiller by Wells Fargo Advisor.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of State bonds at 10 years has increased to 3,482 % over 3,432 % on the day of service, the profitability of bonds at 30 years to 4,492 % over 4,408 % on the night before.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans standing at the power pfeifen "women in Weiss" out
On Thursday, some hundreds of Cuban-powered partisans have exhausted the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Day of Human Rights, as well as another broadcast, which temporarily led to the arrest of a good dozen dissidents.
In order to get the forty women in Weiss, married women or nearby political prisoners, on the open street of partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on the foot march in the centre of the capital to seek the release of the political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankees!, "Söldner!", "the road belongs to the revolutionarys!", "We live Fidel and Raul!", the powerful partisans with raised Faust insulted the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilians who had appeared to "guarante their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "women in Weiss" had taken place in Havana on the night before, where there was neither injury nor arrest.
On the other hand, in the port district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents, who also took place for the demonstration held on Thursday in view of the International Day of Human Rights, were temporarily arrested by civil police officers, confirmed an AFP reporter.
According to this journalist, the government-owned dissidents have forced them to enter civilian vehicles when they use force.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As advocates at the 2005 Sakharov Prizes awarded by the European Parliament, the "women in Weiss" have an unauthorized appeal for the "Pray for the Release of All Political Prisoners", whose number, according to dissident list, is about 200 people, Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is in prison for 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom up to 53 are sitting behind bars.
The Cuban authorities feel the regime opponents as "Söldner" or "agents" in the service of the declared enemy, the United States.
A rarity is that Cuban television provided a report on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and counter-revolutionarys.
The Cuba, led by a party of the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of the abolition of rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Crazy killer kills eight-year-olds with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
On Friday, after midnight, a two-messer-armed lunatic killed an eight-year-old and injured five more people in the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine).
According to the first figures of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the 18-year-olds for an unexplained reason in or before a pharmaceutical at the Boulevard Jean-Jaires with two maestros and this, according to police reports, with witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, is reported to have suffered the consequences of his injuries in the hospital, according to a police union officer named Alliance.
In or before the same apothecary, he married a couple of pregnant women.
The man, about in the tridents, attacked and was injured.
The first two victims were seriously injured in the hospital, where the 18-year-old died.
The other injured swims in danger of life, since according to police sources, apparently vital organs were affected.
The pregnant woman has become ill due to the events and is expected to have been hospitalized in "shock state" according to a police officer.
The armed man who appeared to be under alcohol or drug influence after police reports is to be developed immediately on the road, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passengers, apparently by chance: a three-and-a-half-year-old and a forty-year-old, with the latter of both.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two meat knives, which he crossed behind his back, on the site of Arnaud Pressé, a head of the Union Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passengers, including young people, are supposed to have tried, according to the witness reports obtained by the AFP, to stop the insane.
I saw a guy in the tridents with a green west.
Three young people tried to step in.
They couldn't, because the guy was well built, said Alberto, a basement of a nearby bar.
A horn fell over him, he added, among them a city police officer who broke the wrist.
Still at the Boulevard Jean-Journeys, at the height of the house number 61, two city policemen, including their chairman, tried to capture the armed man and were injured with knives, so police data.
The event was played in one of the main battles of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are a number of shops.
Passants have come to me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I brought her in first aid position and noticed a striking wound in the stomach area, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacologist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about three-year-old, was injured by cutwounds.
The state police force finally arrested the man who did not carry any evidence.
The National Prosecutor of Nanterre has commissioned the District Rapporteur of the Criminal Police Division Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) with the case statement.
The crazy man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been found in court.
A police officer doesn't seem to be being delivered to a nervous hospital.
According to another police source, it required six police officers to arrest him at the police station in Clichy, where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of surprise" as "all mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces were released during the Tatherway".
USA: Polanski's lawyer requests re-arrangement of prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has asked for the prosecution of his officers, who is currently in his residence in Switzerland due to a court case of more than 30 years ago, on Thursday in Los Angeles (California).
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", has urged three judges of the trial court in the second district of California to make serious procedural errors at the time of negotiation in 1977.
I asked for a sentence, Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was in charge of the case at the time of the trial, "let's run a cold down the back".
According to him, the -- in the meantime -- Judge Rittenband, before his trial, discussed with a state attorney who was supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski deserved a breeding house -- which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion was staged in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and wanted), particularly by the state attorney David Wells in question.
Finally, at the end of September, Mr Wells explained that the authors of the documentary film were "blessed".
If the Court of Justice refuses to set up a criminal procedure, Mr Hummel shall require the conduct of a procedure which would enable him to provide evidence for his argument.
The prosecution, on the other hand, has repeated the evidence already stated in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the removal of the accused's file cannot be taken seriously into account, until Roman Polanski appears before the court.
The 76-year-old director fled the U.S. in 1978, even before the prosecution was announced for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old.
He hasn't traveled to the United States since that time.
The Deputy Public Prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, explained that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the negotiations".
Would you like to spread the message on this issue and not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused persons, who are a means of escape?
According to your opinion, the filmmaker asks the court for a case and thus despises its authority.
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to make their decision known – even said, "there are other options to escape".
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the abolition of the criminal procedure.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear it to be disturbed by any recurrence of the Polanski affair and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on the occasion of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was sentenced to a possible delivery to the house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad.
Wall Street is braked by the rise of the dollar and closed without a course.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without a course, in a market that was destroyed between better indicators than expected in the USA and an increase in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63%, while Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65,67 points to 10,471,50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq 0.55 points to 2,190,31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Excuse me, the market is quite quiet," said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains strictly limited, the volume of trade has become very low, and I think this will remain the same until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators as provided for, "that have contributed to improving the market view of the solidarity of the recovery of the economy", analysts joined Charles Schwab.
In the United States, sales in retail trade increased by 1.3% in November, so it has already been two months apart and far more than planned.
Furthermore, the confidence of American consumers has improved significantly in December, at 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan index preview.
However, the indices have been hampered by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level of the euro for two months, so that ''the sectors that are affected by the economic situation are pushed down', said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost something on the ground.
The bond market has fallen.
On Wednesday night, the rate of the shadow loan increased by 3,540 % over 3,482 % and the rate of the loan increased to 4,497 % over 30 years over 4,492 % of the day.
Selecting Miss World again in South Africa
After a month's tour through South Africa, the 112 candidates, entitled to Miss World on Saturday, will exceed the last stage to realize their dream: to be chosen for the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch this for a billion television.
During this great show of beauty, which will be held for the second time in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already booked their ticket to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were cut during her African stay to Miss Sports or Miss Top Model.
This was a real waste of pleasure.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Kap Hoorn, were simply exceptional.
I've seen a lot of things and I've had a lot of experiences!," said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition takes place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be delivered live on Saturday, from 17 a.m. (15 Central European Time) from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, Ms. World Ksenia Sukhinova stressed in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russians, their second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experiences with candidates and the re-discovery of "surpassing landscapes".
After a month of galas, samples, meetings with the press and Safari, the miss now concentrates on competition.
The Indian Poja Chopra hopes to enter the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as Ashwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both Bollywoodstars.
It is of course the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about the appearance here.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a wide smile.
According to the organizer, this 59th edition will be underlined with music and dance.
The candidates are defiling in traditional ways and not forgetting, in the bathroom.
The presentation is presented by a TV moderator, Chinese Angela Chow, by the former beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and by a director of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is white to receive the world with a little overpowering warmth and pride, assures Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates have, like last year, made a Safari, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time it cost with the bike and the local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them his hand, was quite exceptional.
Not usually for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, remains undoubtedly the release in Cape Town (Southwest) of the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to buy something more for this event.
I'm wrong with people I could probably never get closer to.
I will surely return to the 2010 World Championship, promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday is according to his son David "very positive"
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive", his son David assured on Friday at his arrival at the airport of Los Angeles, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it's all going very well, David Hallyday explained the press when he got out of the plane in which he arrived shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m.M.) from Paris.
The son of the singer, who made a relaxing impression, assured that he would be "fastest" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital, when Johnny Hallyday was introduced to Paris on Monday because of a bacterial follow-up infection following an operation on a tape tape incident on November 26.
The singer "this night in Los Angeles was put into an artificial coma to relieve his severe pain and to perform his treatment, announced the press service.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was delivered to Paris on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection following a tape surgery on November 26.
The singer had to undergo surgery again during the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of the recent intervention.
His wife Laeticia took part in a school event in the French gymnasium of Los Angeles in which her daughter Jade went to school on Friday morning.
The head of the department for orthopaedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitié-Salpétrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer has heavily charged the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer in the Clinique international du park Monceau in Paris on November 26.
We were told he set up the purest massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were completely upset, Mr. Camus explained.
I heard you might be in court, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "is too fast and this is traveling with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I called this doctor personally, who assured me that he saw this trip as completely unproblemable, which I was very surprised at, because I had already two tape-disk operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he became known to RTL that the singer would have left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without anything".
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artist environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he also operated the actor Charlotte Gainsburg to resorb a hematoma after a brain bleed.
But he is also a doctor with a questionable reputation, who has been convicted many times because of misoperations and not to forget, due to tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Board of Doctors, referred to him as "a man without scruples" who has "regularly" responsibility before the Board of Directors and is "all other than recommendable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This explained that the intervention would be "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would be "normal".
The operation "does not call for bleeding and therefore does not require drainage", he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been practicing since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is quite clear from the fact that it is too little for a continuation of the tour on January 8th (in Amiens), Mr Camus explained.
The UDF Party (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and calls on the New Centre to no longer use its seal.
The party alliance, monitored by François Bayrou's Party MoDem, reacted strongly on Friday to an attempt by the party to take over the seal, once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, on the side of the chairman of the party Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and urged him not to use this seal on a document under threat of judicial persecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, since he felt that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had reached the left hand.
The Minister of Defence, whose partner is the UMP, also wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In response to his efforts, he had received the support of Senator Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now at NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as he applied for this brand in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propriété industriale".
However, the business units of the UDF party association, supervised by François Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they were not fit and put the Minister and the deputy under threat of judicial persecution a time limit for the use of this seal and the transfer of the ownership rights of the brand.
In the last few days, you have made numerous statements that you would propose your political movement, the UDF seal + take over+, wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem Party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centralist Alliance.
You probably also believed that you would have the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau center+, the slogan + of today's UDF+, on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, explained the UDF's headquarters and called on the NC party to "remove immediately the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (their) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was asked "to transfer the ownership rights of the brand to its legal claims".
If you refuse this, we will raise complaints against you in order to comply with the Act and in order to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stressed that "UDF "has been a full political movement since 1978 and reminds us that Morin and his friends "have made the choice" to leave 2007 to establish a competitive movement, as had already done in 2002 to establish the "UMP" party.
The party has therefore no right to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française) according to the signatories.
They continue to recall that the last UDF 2007 Congress adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a business agency to defend the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the company continues, "it was at the time when he applied for the brand name, for three years no longer a member of the UDF" but the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and deceptive way, from the lack of the deposit of the acronym UDF to perform this for himself.
Furthermore, remember that this lack of respect is in the best way to turn into a criminal, and irony the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us, however, in politics as well as in life more likely to make a name, rather than attempting to come out of the anonymity, by misleadingly entering into a name on which no legal claim has been made".
Afaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is convicted for exploiting weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to review the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether he, like the billionaire's daughter Liliane Bettencourt, had used a weak moment of eight years to get a part of her wealth.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will have to be held accountable on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the exploitation of weakness in court, a penalty that is punishable by a maximum of three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that in fact there will be a process in this case that is worthy of the Saga of one of France's richest families, in which mothers and daughters are fat and at the same time have the toes of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal in hand.
However, the 15th Chamber also arranged a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is conducted jointly by three doctors.
L'Oréal's successor and shareholder have so far refused to undertake such an investigation, especially not under the conditions laid down by the State Prosecutor's Office.
The doctors appointed on Friday will present a report before 10 March 2010 informing you clearly whether and when Liliane Bettencourt may have found himself in a condition of weakness.
I think she'll submit to these investigations.
I'm going to talk to her, the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Me George's Kyejman, explained after the trial.
As far as the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner is concerned, he is very pleased with the decision of the Court.
This is an excellent novelty (...). The opinion will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady who needs to be protected, he confirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has initiated a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of having used her mother's weakness for years to make payments of a total of a billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
On your side, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by the photographer, whom she sees as a long-standing friend.
Although the Court had to examine the admissibility of the complaint brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Mayers, the Plaidyers of the lawyers led to a large family break on Friday.
So the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt called on three of his clients to send letters to her note (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she slandered the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please explain to my daughter that I have written banners for fifteen years once or twice a day.
Françoise, I have never been able to speak again since her heroship."
The National Prosecutor of Nanterre once again believes that the plaintiff had no right to react, especially because a pre-mortem judge has rejected her application in the last days to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not protected and has no prior mouth.
No one has the right to act in their place," confirmed the representative of the Public Prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court has now decided to issue a judgment after the procedure for the authorisation of Ms Bettencourt-Mayers took place.
Manager revolution or the end of the strategic early announcement?
If nothing changes with the leadership of the great French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis consumers before the Marketing Revolution: It is the best "values" for the staff, as it used to be designed for consumer products by the technicians at work.
By giving customers at the company's centre, the marketing revolution has given the strategies for the acquisition of the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian attempt products separate Factors Customer preferences are required on a regular basis again!
Demobilization of employees can lead to a fatal demobilization.
The suicides of France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially those of F&Eund, which is even more decisive, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) "of all the parties involved (...) calls for a proactive approach and a future-oriented approach"; it calls on employees to use a method that fully contradicts the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution that would allow employees to be equally entitled to put their interests at the centre of the company next to the customer.
The very conditional benefits of internal questions of opinion
Will the internal questions of opinion, such as the questionnaire that the Orange has circulated to its payees, encourage this revolution in relation to management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to find that, given a new situation, the whole thing finally comes to the point of doing what it's always done.
Also because of authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power-proportional increases the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most leaders have a very simple idea of human behavior.
Based on the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They take over by intellectual comfort the old behavioral theory, which was recently reactivated by the American "neurusciences" and was unmistakably widely distributed by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to perform the "Hebel" (sic) to engage employees, a current Le Figaro.fr survey of Ipsos strengthens the leadership in a position to a mechanical control system that is inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies presupposes the adoption of a final view of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating a basic protocol into any discussion or practice of governance: for the recipient, the commitment to the company is only possible if it is clearly a means of realising a part of its dreams, its ambitions and its projects.
At the moment only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a given Doxa that allows them to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the management forces of companies can control their "social performance", predict and predict and reposition their human resource management in the right place.
In this way they create a fruitful ground that is beneficial to the proper development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the "right war" brought Obama to the right
The U.S. rights on Friday welcomed the speech made by Barack Obama last night in Oslo and was pleased that the 2009 Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who had ridiculed Obama's award on 9 October praised the President's speech this time, following the example of the former presidential candidate in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, Palin explained that the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the daily USA Today and added that she had brought the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war into the language of memoirs published in her own language.
Of course, the war is the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of violence; a way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expresses the view that the president has done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives, who particularly recognized the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, this speech was quite historical, explained Ginrich, who was questioned in the radio broadcast "The Takeaway".
The former MP, considered by some as a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left" who reminded members of the Nobel Committee that they "could not be free and could not afford a prize for peace if the use of violence did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and currently editor at Washington Post, Obama has "a very American speech".
In addition to being a "cosmopolitan" as "who always does it", he spoke "as an American president", pointing out that Europeans "are living in a security bubble that they have not created themselves and do not do much for their protection," says Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a Falke of the Agea Bush, called the talk on the National Review Online website "long-term, high-level and unintelligible".
To the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the retreat to the forces of war.
If the war is packed under the cover of justice, the massacrer can simply justify the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the moderated left continues to praise the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the early Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama, called the address itself for a speaker like him who is known for his talent as "Monumental work".
The talk in Oslo "is a final plan to control international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression", as the California daily is excited.
The New York Times believes that Obama "declared the necessary discourse" and refers to his speech as "distant and exemplary at the same time".
Remote driver: Three Marathons for an agreement that ensures the provision of Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the Road Association and the Tlf - the only employers' organization that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday, ending the strike order and the threatening heavy supply pass at Christmas.
At the signing meeting on Friday, the Secretary of State responsible for transport Dominique Bussereau welcomed the agreement launched on Wednesday after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second negotiation night, the negotiators separated early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement quickly in the early morning.
And although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 until the conclusion of the agreement, and the agreement was signed only at 18:00.
The conflict "would have caused a lot of damage to the company" and "was to fear that it would affect the holiday at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for an increase in wages by 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest pay groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages therefore rises from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
"That's not very much, but we're starting to start small," says Patricia Clos (FO).
The activists are now told not to block the supply centres anymore.
"But there will probably always be some opponents who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
The TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "hard to avoid these wage increases in view of international competition".
According to him, the increase of 170 euros per month is for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on a healthy human understanding and respect for the employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "an historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) expressed himself in this regard "an acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for an increase of 3 % in travel costs and the maintenance of the General Committee for Road Transport in the first half of 2010, which will in particular allow the issue of the 13th month content and the modernisation of tariff agreements to be addressed.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of taxes on employers amounting to EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the Government to the draft law for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for an identical vote by the Senate.
The signing of the TTF allows the agreement to be applied first to the companies associated with the organisation and subsequently to be applied in the case of an extension by the Minister of Labour for the whole professional status.
This will be "in the shortest time" of the case, insured Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only exacerbate the procedure.
The FNTR Federation has launched a "misleading trade" because the 100 million euros "were already promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but not to grieve the Gans-Esser on the coming Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement threatens "to strike a large grave for small and medium-sized enterprises in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Unsatisfied at this weekend, unions with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the RER A line, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the Greater Paris and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris People's Transport Administration), the strikers with their demands for pay allowances continued.
At this important shopping weekend before Christmas, between 10:00 and 20:00, no trains traveled. On the central track (between La Defense and Nation) was only one of two trains and only one of four trains outside the central track.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, which forced the travelers to cross.
The purchase chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "I'm trying to connect the major businesses in transport".
The RER A line crosses the Pariser Ballungsraum from west to east.
The section of the RATP connects the places Saint-germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of the two trains was scheduled for the main traffic time, and almost no one was involved during the low traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no maniac on the railways, as the inhabitants of Île-de-France had responded to the situation.
As early as the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less overrun than anyone else, especially due to the lack of gymnasiums.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), explained that he would have been up to "one and a half hours earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to care for the passengers by staff and law enforcement, pointed out that there were no roadblocks at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le- skin came on or went over the Saint-Lazare train station to ensure access to the metros there.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the strikers took place again, while the results were reviewed, which the associations, after meeting with the leadership, classified as "good" on Friday afternoon.
The RER supervisor proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (South), they are demanding a long-term pay supplement.
The CGT was encouraged that the RATP itself put its pay supplement proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership was "not able to solve a problem, while it was possible for the remoters and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting would be scheduled for Monday for the "extensive examination of working conditions".
This also shows the associations that the company "neglects the weekend riders".
On the morning of the morning, about 150 drivers sought the release of a committee in Paris.
Again it was the leadership point that so far refused any discussion during the strike, and brought about a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend to the RER B line after an announcement of Unsa and independents.
The associations call for a wage allowance of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents). They also complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers are travelling daily.
The RER line drivers who have over years of professional experience relate to a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros and a salary allowance of 600 to 650 euros for shift services, as well as sun and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court solves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the resolution of the pro-Kurdish main party of the country; a decision following the imminent demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the Government very difficult, which is trying to reach the Kurdish Community in order to put an end to the 25-year conflict.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it became a "place for activities which are harmful to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," said President Hasim Kilic, president of the Constitutional Court four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been unanimously taken by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to hold the resolution, and he pointed out that 37 of the party's leadership, including President Ahmet Türk and Parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, had been excluded for the duration of five years from the political event.
Furthermore, the judge announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity, Turkey and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party's property.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The leaders expressed themselves in favour of the ruling that the parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than become partisan parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated by the Turkish Federal Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007. He accused the DTP of following the "revisions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is viewed by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party ensures that there is "no connection" to the PKK, however, refuses to designate it as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court is in the meantime the Government, which aims to oppose the Kurdish Community and to propose a number of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to facilitate the support of the PKK through the Kurds and to put an end to the conflicts.
The DTP leaders confirm that a resolution could lead to a recurrence of tensions in South-East Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of the PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan had led to clash with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP's premises in the million city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is mainly populated by Kurden.
When the demonstrators started throwing Molotow cocktails and stones, the order forces put in gas grenades and water wells.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
According to the judgment, Turkey assumed that the court's decision "to further deepen despair" would be extended.
"Turkey cannot clarify this (Kurdish, etc. editorial) question on the basis of the ban on a party," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party that has emerged from the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose in principle the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo of the democratic opening promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously take a response to the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK was known as an attack on which seven soldiers in the north of Turkey were killed three days earlier. It was one of the most brutal attacks of the past months.
The snow may break
A really crack winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to blackmail the citizens, says the FES Winter Service Manager.
In addition, to enable his employees to test and master the entire vehicle technology.
At the weekend it could be so far, according to meteorologists for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The ESF is in line with an accurate plan.
As soon as it is flat-covered in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-ways will be taken off with large-scale vehicles, explains Brauburger.
For example, the main roads include the New Way and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also firefighting, ÖPNV routes, pedestrian zones and routes with cases such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometres had to be spread in a maximum of three hours with moisture salt, which is better held.
That is why the FES starts at three o'clock in the night, "so that the routes are free until professional transport begins".
It'll be hard if it's only cut at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is ready to make room for the electric vehicles".
Only after that, if it does not cut further, are the roads for delivery and clearance, including the Council's Bill road, on the line.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints, Mr Brauburger.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES footing will be mainly cleared on the way, danger points and transitions.
The FES can't take care of all the bike routes.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps the bridges in sight from 22 to 4.30 p.m. above all, says Brauburger.
Since it is on these fast rocks, it is as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the stretcher is on the way.
If necessary, this will also be called by the police.
The Waves of the Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-flavouring dinosaurs: the two meters long and 1.50 meters big animal ran on two strong hind legs, had a long shoulder with sharp, bent teeth, short arms with cyclists and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the magazine Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the Pangäa supercontinent on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window for the early evolution of the dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us much about the relationship, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other palaeontologists began digging at the Ghost Ranch in North New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones on one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
During the excavation, they brought together the rest of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino's early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi-Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an exceptional fund: "Dinosauri fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, most of them only find single pieces."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says, for example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current teaching, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils, however, are incomplete, so the coordination of these ur-dinos is usually disputed.
For example, the experts debate when the oaks split into their three main development lines: the meat-frozen theropods, later called the Tyronosaurus reg, the Velocioraptor and also the birds, which are known as the "longhele" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the plants-frozen ornithischia (bird bees) that belonged to, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is an original theropode.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
In the shadow of Tawa Hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of airbags, as well as of the descendants of the therapists, the birds.
Thanks to the airbag, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than that of the mammals.
At Tawa Hallae the bones of the vertebral column were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theopod with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge sauropods later also owned airbags and lightweight construction bones, it was likely that the common precedent of the two groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs in South America have ever lived, the researchers follow that the oaks appeared there for the first time.
Thus, the three development lines were already separated early and spread from South America across all parts of the earth, which at the time were still a single mass of land as a supercontinent of Pangäa.
The fact is that the team, together with Tawa, brought the rest of two other, not particularly close related theropods.
The three cannot derive from a common, imported precedent, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the Science study.
Free there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonner Palaeontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be distorted because in South America there were only a lot of primitive Dino fossils left, while on other continents there was hardly anything to be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to develop themselves from a relatively rare line of Reptilian strain to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the earthenware age is still formidable.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptilians, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and aerosols, and with many others.
Towards the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread throughout the world and developed many new species, while the relationship on the border between the Trias and the Jura died.
The story of success did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but not the other Reptilians.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could beat the competition out of the field.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite invasion of a group of animals to the flower, which had also developed in the Trias, and since then a shadowed dais: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors of University Toronto, University of Cambridge, University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
Teachers from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police space of the occupied casino of Frankfurt Goethe University hit waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers of the Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidarity with the Protestant students at Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, "infallible" she made the police use imposed by the Bureau.
Uni President Werner Müller-Estler had the buildings occupied by students and teachers in the education race to be accommodated last week because walls and works of art had been damaged.
Five students were injured.
The damage done by the signatories did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organized teaching events of students and teachers by a police icon command".
The room represents an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism is "delegation and criminalization of the protest" and deviates from the contents.
The Bureau withdrew the necessary speech.
The lecturers call for the immediate imposition of criminal proceedings.
The majority of the owners did not support the injury, that is.
Protest legitimate
The young men of the Verdi Association and the German Association Association also cooperate with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for the future of its own, says Verdi-Landezgenssecretary Alexander Klein.
Hessens Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the President and the police.
We are grateful to the uni-president.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, so the CDU agent Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, they saw the opposition groups SPD, green and left.
The CDU takes painted walls to the front to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the student's arguments and demands, they have been kept secret.
The Left has tabled an application calling on the Interior Minister to report on police deployment.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, unavailable for Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a strictly guarded place in the Soviet Union for secret weapons research.
Today, the municipality is considered to be a "Russian Silicon Valley" with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow centre.
Important research and production sites for micro and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have had contacts with the Frankfurt Science Centre Riedberg - with the universities and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday now, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol for Closer Cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Vice-President Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, who signed for Frankfurt by planning director Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural science research focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Companies of the FIZ are allowed to take foot on the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian science firms want to record orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large companies of Lemonics and Rossijskaja Electronics.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for weapons research.
Selenograd (verbally translated "Grünstadt") received its name from the forested hillland in which the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgart Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not enough.
For the proponents of the project it is easy and simple to "the new heart of Europe".
Right. S21 is much more than the grounding of a railway station, more than a monster construction project, which will collapse the city of the Baden-Württemberg capital for a decade in unhindered construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
At that time, main railway stations with rails that end in the middle of the city were considered to be transport fossils of the 19th century, which acted as brake blocks of modern rail transport, since it once took enormous amount of time to revolving locomotives from the back to the front.
Get in, stay short, keep going - so you should go.
Therefore, the main railway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a train station, which is located about half the length of the trans-European rail highway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, which is why the slogan of the heart of Europe.
S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that it is almost non-payable in the Hessian and Bavarian capital to implement the underground.
However, there has been no problem of entry and exit since there have been modern gears with motor vehicles and tax cars at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE Neubaustrike to Ulm is now being accessed.
National and municipal politicians have put it through.
The railway also carries the risks of the largest single infrastructure project of the Republic of Taxpayers and not of the State Group.
The project can be justified to some extent by urban construction.
It creates a new city space, which - you think you are equipped with computer-generated graphics of the planner - with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the transport system.
The train station and road construction are intended for passenger transport, which - typically 80 years of age - was attributed to huge growth.
At that time, there was no competition from the airlines.
Modern transport policy, however, must first be aimed at strengthening freight transport, as transport on the rail is considerably more environmentally friendly than on the road by truck.
However, the new track does not run for heavy climbs.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly also involves many other railway projects.
A total of six billion euros is to be disseminated in Swedish.
That's the official number.
Experts hold 10 to 15 billion realistic.
It is said that in the next decade, the money will be missing at other nodes and outlets in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the well 180 km long route through the Rheintal.
Since 1987 it has been built on the track at the time of the weather.
It would be urgent to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake lock.
The Rheintal route will be the bottleneck for international freight: in the heart of Europe.
The government examines the judgment on the airport
In Wiesbaden Landtag, the Government has made clear whether it will be audited against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH).
The CDU/FDP Coalition has commissioned experts to examine the more than 400-page VGH decision, Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
On that day, the VGH in Kassel had written reasons that in the case of the construction of the planned Northwest Landebah in Frankfurt Airport, the country had to reintroduce the night flight ban.
The permit of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as envisaged by the Government, is not to be agreed with the statutory protection of the population against night flying noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it is against the verdict in the review.
The opposition criticised this upheaval and urged the government's representatives to reject a revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD fractional chief Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, it should be considered a "word break".
It's damn hard if you can keep his word, Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir said on the FDP election logo "We keep the word".
Minister Posch pointed back to Schäfer-Gümbel's proposal that the government try to come to their night flights with "right-wing and trickery".
A precise legal examination takes time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legal solution, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, the statements of his group for the night flight ban were never.
U.S. Banks Pay Back Help
The crisis-sponsored U.S. Grand Banks are tearing down their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the assistance from the Tarp Bank Savings Fund, amounting to a total of 45 billion dollars (a total of 30 billion euros) to a blow.
The Citigroup also plans to repay State aid after a report by the US envoy CNBC.
The institutions want to remove the restrictions that have been accepted with the adoption of the money, such as the limitation on the payment of managers and the creation of high fees.
The Bank of America had made good 19 billion dollars of fresh money for investors in exchange loans.
The rest of the sum took it out of its own box, which, among other things, was well filled by sale of parts.
Bank Chief Kenneth Lewis expressed his appreciation for the American taxpayer on Wednesday afternoon: the money sprites have helped over a very difficult time.
The cash house had raised itself to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to obtain money on the capital market for exemption from its obligations vis-à-vis the State.
As early as Thursday, the US bank could announce a serious increase of about $20 billion in its capital, CNBC reported in calling circles.
A Citigroup speaker did not want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their aid.
Quick Select
But then it went faster than thought.
Almost two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had forced Chief Editor Nikolaus Brender from the office, the sender can present a successor.
Last night the board wanted to vote on the staff.
As a favorite, Peter Frey, head of the ZDF Capital Studio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the sender - officially in order not to prejudge the procedure.
However, they should also have played a role in preventing the ZDF applicant Markus Schäger from further harming, nor should this proposal be implemented by the Board of Directors.
Frey, shadow candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the jury.
The result of the vote has not yet been established at the conclusion of the drafting of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schäger and his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender to another five years, was defeated by the Board of Directors.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's election was a herb defeat for shadowers, one expected though.
As the majority of the Union in the Governing Council had already signaled weeks before the election, Brander did not want to confirm in the office.
The opposition was organised against the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument, under Brander, that the ZDF's message had lost its share ratios, he refused another term of office of the senior editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was cast.
In the last few years, even 35 lawmakers had joined the debate, which considered the progress of the Cooks to be a constitutional violation.
It's useless.
To Person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, teaching and Romanism.
After that, he worked for the Southwest radio and the Frankfurt Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to the "Today-Journal".
Follow-up stations: 1988 to 1990 Personal Rapporteur of the Chief Editor; 1991/92 Correspondent in Washington; until 1998 Head and Moderator of the "Morgenmagazine"; until 2001 Head of the ZDF External Policy; since then Head of the ZDF Capital Studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the selection of Brenders, which was elected by the media magazine industry on Wednesday, as journalist of the year.
Kochs, Vice-President Kurt Beck of the Board of Directors of the Rhine-Palesian Ministry, explained last week that the countries should amend the IMF State Treaty in such a way that the candidate's personal proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a withdrawal of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender's expected successor, Peter Frey, had recommended to the Board of Directors a clever chess course - by criticizing the board immediately after the Brender elections.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, both depositors could nominate him without loss of face for the posts of the Chief Editor and select the Board of Directors, without being suspected of raising a party to the office.
Frey is also a member of the Left Liberals Party.
Studying Dissemination
Part success for the students: After one year of the education course, the Minister of Culture of the countries finally launched on Thursday: At a meeting of Ministers of Culture and Higher Education, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
They agreed on reducing the test load: basically, each study module should only be completed with a single test.
In addition, the students' workload should be reviewed and "a realistic and dissuasive measure" guaranteed.
In addition, policies and universities want to simplify the recognition of examination services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for bachelor and master studies more flexible.
There should be no different country rules.
Less Tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and uni-records have borne the winged word of the better studyability in the mouth.
Now it was filled with a specific content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Board decided to reduce the number of tests partially: "Each module usually closes with only one test", says a 30-page paper that should partially re-regulate the authorisation of studies.
With the "significant reduction of the test load", the Accreditation Council Chairman Reinhold Grimm explained, "the content should be provided for a "joint development that significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, the "Studyability" will be "the decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules such as content are "strengthened to check" whether "needless student inputs in the choice of
Events would be avoided.
The students would have "a claim to receive playgrounds that enable and promote their own initiative".
The rules should apply to the approval of new studies, but also to the review of existing studies.
These must be "recredited" every five years – however, which means that it will take until 2015 all studies have been reviewed.
There are about ten accreditation agencies in charge of the accreditation board set up by the countries.
The Ministers of Culture had called on the countries in October to influence the agencies so that the stuff was not too large and the inspection regime was not too strict.
In each country, universities and universities with the Ministry of State have already agreed on appropriate measures.
As a single country so far, Rheinland-Pfalz said additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
From the money, the universities are intended to set up tutoring programmes and to strengthen study advice as well as examination and foreign offices.
Countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring a novelty of the law to Parliament.
After this, only one test is required for the completion of a study model.
The study design is designed to be more flexible, as well as to ensure recognition of performance qualifications at other universities and to facilitate access to the master.
By the end of the year, all studies in the country will be reviewed on their feasibility.
The government and opposition had once again disputed the conditions of study in the country on Thursday.
Besides Lob, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso High Schools asked that the design of the education policy should in future no longer take place "under closed doors" of the Ministers and Directors of Higher Education.
At the latest, after the course of education, students should also be present as concerned as "a word".
The future academics received support from the President of the Conference of High School Directors (HRK), Margaret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with whom the HRK discusss a common reform paper.
The Association of Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough: it calls for a legal requirement that allows each graduate with a Bachelor degree access to a further master's degree.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that for the present generation of Bachelor students there will be sufficient master study sites with the best possible study conditions tomorrow, according to GEW member of the board Andreas Keller.
The countries must clearly set up more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express free access to the Master.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Going into Germany and out is almost no control..." says the initial line of a poem by Lyriker Werner Söllner, in which this in disruptive language fétitiques the experience of a dissident who has gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Romania, had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's bookstore, before he moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
During a meeting in Munich last Tuesday, he took care of a considerable extraliterate view, where it was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of its security structures".
Apparently, Söllner left a statement in which he supported his cooperation as IM for the Romanian Secret Service Security, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the participants, Söllner had received the German language price in 1989.
The application trials had begun in the same way, first in 1971.
I'm, closed Söllner, "so someone who hasn't confessed to security attempts."
The Lyriker Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
At the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its unparalleled literary dispute with the dictatorial regime mechanisms, the literature scene and, in particular, the community of the German authors coming from Romania will be shielded by a case that makes the reasons for and the failure of a political system, which is based on surveillance and speculation.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can say according to previous knowledge, not only the perpetrators, but also the victims.
In his security act, IM Walter played a role, said after Söllner's statement of literature scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He's got him in all of the difficult points for him at the time, as Markel said.
It was a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner's statement, however, was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, completely surprising the recognition of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Germany was a welcoming reserve for security hospital, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after reading her own file, 914 pages.
The affected, so you can assume, are speculated and in some cases have probably also known which names are clear behind the cover names Sorin, Voic and also Walter.
In contrast to the very procedural approach of the Stasi acts in this country, it is still very common to deal with the backlogs of security surveillance.
A systematic clarification has been delayed and hampered in recent years.
One of the Birthler authorities of the National Council for the Development of the Safety Acts (CNSAS) was established only in 1999, but the issue of the Acts has since been more fragmented.
Only since 2005, there has been a law governing the administration of the acts.
The fact that the influence of former security members in Romania is still very high has led to an interview after the award was announced for Herta Müller, in which a former security chief from Temesvar expressed his contempt for the prize winner.
You've got a psychosis, you've only heard it once.
The infamy of power here meant to be completely unconcerned in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, in the case of Söllner, as often in the context of debt debt, there are inevitable questions.
Why just now? Who has been damaged? The apparent reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by knowledge rather than by debt and shame.
To the Genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who took the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Supplement to the Champions League
It seemed as if there was a neatly dressed outdoor servant from a very nice Christmas party, where a sports article manufacturer Goodies had distributed, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross went up a quarter hour after midnight in the accompanied by an orange-coloured plastic product of the equipment into a c-class.
The man with the marked glazing was able to drive for the rest of the city.
Otherwise he could have run himself - alcohol was not in the game at all, and the 55-year-old was just as busy as he was.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work goes on.
Or just let it go.
In the words of the first three days of the mandatory Swiss: "We have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" was ahead of Sunday.
Then it is applicable to repeat the royal class performance in Mainz on the day of the League.
And to remove the completely re-discovered weaknesses after the fast three gates through Marica (5), Tresch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Justification
The eighth final of the Champions League (Hinsgames 16/17. + 23/24 February/ 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the fulminant unit of the Babel successor remained.
Not only did the alleged curer, who had served the uncertain Stuttgart profession in the short term confidence, commitment and pleasure of the game.
I went to the players and told them that they should rely on their strengths, and I stopped them to be more courageous, the soul-clamper Gross explained the so simple sounding success recipe that under Therapeut Babbel had no effect anymore.
He has invented a certain magic, said Babel advocate Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes to football, sometimes things happen that would not have been possible."
And Sami Khedira, who progressed to the best player on the spot after a week of injury, after a break of weeks, tried to describe the identified "phenomenes" with the word "fresh wind" and the new leader's way of working: "He is a man who takes steps and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
Under Babel, it was apparently lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not about the mountain yet, warns Sports Manager Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart, however, needs a constant.
Like Gross, players and managers were also careful to overestimate the victory against a weakened and completely overpowered resistance of Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil wake up, gave Khedira to think about.
And Sports Chairman Horst Heldt warned that although a season goal was reached, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
That holding on his 40th birthday even after his first home victory was not about to celebrate for three months, was the event of the weekend, which took place freshly in the form of a television interview by Torhüter Jens Lehmann, which was broadcast immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that the others make, not the Jens, counted on the harsh criticism of Lehmanns.
He had suggested that the board have failed leadership and decided to change training on the pressure of puberty fans.
Even that his free day was cut off after games, Lehmann valued as a sign of lack of sovereignty and mistrust.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure egoism", he turned back and announced consequences to the final man.
You'll probably not be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
However, they agreed with all the others that without the preparations by the dissolved training team it would not have been possible to play and fight.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and the man agreed with the plastics.
WM-Fight in Weight
Hotty duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson Worldmester Vitali Klitschko again provoked words and gestures.
After twelve hard rounds, however, the Ukrainian defended its heavyweight title by version of the WBC.
The judgment of the Court of Justice was delivered unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains a world champion in weight.
The 38-year-old WBC team won the U.S. Kevin Johnson single-handedly on Saturday night in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
In the past, the Ukrainian was twice the world champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't work out with the K.o. that everyone expected.
Klitschko built his balance on 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to fight because of injuries.
Challenged Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th struggle.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Bernarena Arena, the 2,02 meters big clitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
The 11 centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, however, repeatedly withdrew the battles of the world master, so that Klitschko could not reach his dangerous rights decisively.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried only to come over the rounds.
Although he provoked clitschko with words and gestures, his beatings only rarely met the world champion.
In the meantime, he was only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had taken care of some vertebrates before fighting in the Swiss capital.
He attacked Klitschko as "hate zombie", which "nothing can be right".
On Wednesday, the champion was allowed to provoke on Friday to blow the sunglasses off the nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory to Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also won in his fourth fight after his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years in the meantime, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered his WBC belt, which he had to give up without fighting.
In this year, he then forced Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Areola from the United States in September.
In this fight I got only one shot and I'm physically very good in shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of WBO and IBF.
However, the WBA belt is worn by British David Haye after it was removed in November at 2,13 metres from Nikolai Waljew.
Haye had given up a battle against Vitali Klitschko in the summer.
Apparently, his promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko at the London Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz Falls
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Fraction Chief Jürgen Trittin has referred to defence minister Guttenberg as a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and left require clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - After recent findings of Kunduz's air attack, the opposition Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a deliberate deception.
The minister said that on Saturday in the ARD news release, Green Fraction Chief Jürgen Trittin said on the Saturday "Day Show" to two tank crews from September.
It's called land-run: He lied.
The killing order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Group for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had read to Mr Gutenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday it was known that the attack was not only to destroy the exported cargo, but also to kill two Taliban leaders targeted.
The US air raid requested by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein was reportedly killed or injured by up to 142 people.
Green, SPD and left asked the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the Federal Day and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Ms Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of the targeted death is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Government - and whether the Chancellor, Federal Defence and News Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green-Colleg Renate Kunast requested.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm decided to withdraw the criticism.
The Office did not take any influence on the concrete initiatives of the Federal Defence in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, also doubts were raised regarding the Ministry's presentation of the reasons for the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have correctly and fully informed about the background of the tanker attack.
Officially, it had been said that they would have claimed the existence of the Nato reports and would continue to provide the Minister with sensitive details.
However, from the background of the two senior officials, they pointed out that they had even pointed to several reports, including a separate document of the commander-in-chief and a campaign report.
Wichert is currently supposed to have prayed in a letter to clarify the situation, reports the "Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper".
He hasn't received an answer so far, that is.
The Ministry did not comment on the proposals on Saturday and pointed out that this would be explained in the Federal Survey Committee, which wants to be established on Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see pictures and hear voices in a watchful state that others do not see or hear.
Not only in mental illness and drug abuse, the boundaries between imagination and reality are waning.
As long as it happens in bed, everything's fine.
If we are in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can always give up the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, those who experience traumatic conditions in growth see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered as crazy or drug addicts in the modern Western world, at least as special.
However, such images and voices do not only arise in mental illness or drug use.
We owe our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, ensure that the borders between dream, madness and reality are floating.
Traumatically altered alertness conditions can occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case Wahn.
Even if triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mystic Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age Prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic state of expression, psychosis and hallucinations can be attributed to similar processes.
Halluzinations or faeces occur when the balance of the neuronal mucosal substances of the brain - all in front of dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is eliminated and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between madness and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since the ancient times.
Aristotle described hallucinations as a form of the dream in awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, in 1861 found a "great similarity of the irresistance with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, delusional formations, sensational distortions of such a thing".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and silent.
The gravity no longer has power over him, he swims on the roof of the room.
He's feeling a little bit.
Behind him, flying devil shapes with blued, distorted frescoes, teething.
They hunt him, hit him with heavy, flaming sticks, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Voice, evil voices dries out of walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo system, taps it into a loop and fastens it on a hook on the deck.
He's up on a speaker and he's lying around his neck.
Jump.
The snake gets rid of it.
That's supposed to be a lesson for you, the voices in the drummer corps, "go to the clinic and be healed!"
Today Henning T. 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last 2 years are back, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is called schizophrenic-paranoid psychosis, and he is manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The trump images are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in their lives from schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, affected people may no longer be able to distinguish between the inner and outer world, and they are in an exaggerated state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Especially widespread is the voice hearing - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not rare either.
The person concerned is unable to separate Importants from Unweighted, the brain can no longer filter the disruptive signals, the consciousness is overwhelmed by impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the doors for a flow of ideas and imagination, which emerges from deeper consciousness layers.
The reality perception in the psychosis is subject-centred, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, an observator of the General Psychiatry Clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenia is located in the center of the story, everything has a bearing on it.
At the same time, he acts in a passive role, he becomes, like in the dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrene therefore often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality comparison is usually not possible for them, the trux images are cruel reality, excluding wakes.
Once in life to experience a hallucination
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in the psychosis remains in principle."
The crazy thoughts and hallucinations are in reality, the expansion of experience is taking place in the real framework.
Why our brain beats caprioles, researchers still face puzzles.
Exceptional conditions can cause any person to lose reality in a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
It seems to be a genetic institution for schizophrenia, but twinning studies have shown that the genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage.
We assume that the neuronal respiration of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, due to a mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, for example, explains Fuchs.
But there remains a challenge as to how the neuronal system is disrupted, which does not manifest itself at first for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis when the mood is present.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they enter the transmitter system.
When Our Brain Runs Hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer under their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get what, says Lübecker Psychology Professor Erich Kasten.
Whether trog images are found to be acceptable or unacceptable is often just a question of the position.
Boxes have been collecting reports of hallucinations and triger appearances for ten years, last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are part of the typical symptoms of psychosis, but also of surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's and mucous membrane trauma are often included.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brain itself heals healthy people.
Halluzinations, such as boxes, consist of memory content, which are usually retained.
They occur when the brains are overactive or too low, if our brain is hot, or even if there is lack of stimulation.
Drugs can cause this condition as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also travel, stress, love or other mental state exceptions.
In recent studies, up to one third of the respondents reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visiting the gymnasium there.
A very normal girl, actually.
If it weren't for the pictures and voices.
In the break, it may occur that a smart boy with long, dark hair addresses it.
When he answers, the students look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They're holding the scared girl for a spooky day dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees these guys, just as she sees and hears the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
I'm crazy, she sometimes asks.
But she knows that this boy and the other truck images aren't real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are mostly scary
Often the truck images are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can't follow the teaching material sometimes because the teacher in her eyes and ears just introduces a new fellow while he explains mathematical equations to all the others on the table.
At night, the appearances are mostly scary.
When she is waiting in her dark room on the bed, which is too rare and too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or is already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the frescoes or the girl with the bloody cuts on her arms and legs, come forth before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the shapes.
Parents and friends don't tell them anything that would make them crazy.
autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She's been living with her friend last year.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she's been in Internet contact with the psychologist box, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Wahn is also an art work of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from a trip, he is very likely to have some hallucinations, says Kasten.
I guess the brain is under-occupied and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned with 13 that the man she called Papa since she could think is not her living father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for people like Sarah K. to distinguish trux images and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is located in the brain, the reality is formed there.
Halluzinations are also images that allow the brain to arise, so they seem so real."
Also nightly dream images value boxes as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenia, mental health is able to recognize their Trugimages as unrealistic.
Boxes therefore advise their patients to value the hallucinations as a special ability.
Limit state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our highly conscious world, imaginary experience is mostly pathology, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also brings positive, creative waves - also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneuroid experience, a special form of the traumaticly altered alertness.
Oneuroids are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams that the experienced person holds for real and that he cannot, in the future, distinguish himself from the state of growth.
The oneuroid state of consciousness occurs in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor failure in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by self and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening reality situation by a world of his own, imaginary that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to deal with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is now happening in the imagination.
An intense form of sensitization and singing in an inconspicuous situation that enables humans to make their own design is not to be subjected to any loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zürcher art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneuroid experiences in his book "Hertzchange" as a rescue operation of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness develops after a heart beat operation with subsequent heart transplantation on journeys, while his body is condemned at the Intensive Station for motionlessness.
Clausen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: He experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the eagles who produce the means of fumes from blood.
If he is dragged by a Greek on the motorcycle in his home country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely into the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These internal journeys differ fundamentally from each dream.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are clear to me after years and in detail.
Even more clear and intense than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience exacerbates the horizon of our other life experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneuroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug smoke show how fragile our internal images of external reality are also in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist caste, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can be completely enriching.

Burda
Children are to take over the publisher at 27 years of age
The new publisher Callen is an intermediate solution: long-term Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding is also expected to be 100 per cent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children are 27 years old and are determined to join the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
We have carefully arranged the details for this.
The question of whether they are active in the company first arises.
The question is whether they are able to do so.
You can't introduce 7500 employees to your children if they're not qualified enough.
This also affects the children and the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he had retired from the presidency since January and named Paul-Bernhard Callen as his successor.
The 52-year-old call has been a member of the board since 1999 at Burda.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury area, the responsibility for the company's assets and after the expulsion of Jürgen Mortenhofer was also the responsibility for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, therefore, there is no family member at the top of the publishing.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The name of Callen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years," says Burda.
The holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future," Burda said.
With a view to the cases of Schakedandz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family companies are not safe before the decline: "This always affected families who were getting caught by a search for capital that had completely speculated and thought they could rise to a very large player.
My strategy was never.
He's had "no world power dreams," so Burda.
I do not see myself as the political president of this country, as it was springing, and I do not want to play with 'Time' in the world league, these stores have become too big.
Perfect beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and wellbeing is now available to you.
This is at least what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2m shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything revolves only around body care.
In the area of wellness, which is located on the eighth floor, you can find among other companies such as Hedonai, who provide for recreation with lasers; Spaxion, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; hairdressers Luis & Taci, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitine with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that represents more than 130 different tea varieties through its teahouse.
A relaxing massage together with your partner and at the same time having a fantastic view of the capital, or for two hours renting the relaxation area to put your own "beauty party" with eight friends on your legs and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just a few of the many possibilities that Spaxion offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The fitness studio also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the customer's training units and thus provide them with a complete personal training.
You start a training unit with the input of a personal password on a touch screen that is in front of the devices.
Then show you various videos how to properly run your training units.
The head of the fitness studio ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and decoupling) are fully sufficient to train the body muscles.
If then, after you have trained your body, you still want to take a look at the hair salon, the company Luis & Taci has a room in which treatments for resuscitation of hair speech, shine and health for your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. 365 days a year.
The Variety of Decoletés
Christmas is getting closer and so it's a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and get their solid clothes in our wardrobe.
The form of the decolletés, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an overcrowded and very complicated decolleté. Only one can embrace it.
Endesa and Barcelona with the electric car
The power company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, created the "LIVE office".
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and enter into agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarise the opinions and actions of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include activities related to energy and in particular to their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative to participate in the endesa with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and maintains a whole range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of peace" for the car sector
The government president, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the Spanish automotive industry's prophecy, which is the country's gross exporter, "a horizon of peace".
In presenting the economic report for 2009 by the presidents, Zapatero recalled once again the developments that the government has launched in support of the automotive sector during the government year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, today we would have a view of the neglect and the closure of some of our main production works," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a peaceful horizon for the future of this industry, which is our growing export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided EUR 800 million for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided more than EUR 3 billion for investments.
The Government explained that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlined the Government's commitment to the accrual of demand, in line with the plan 2000E, which will be applied in cooperation with the autonomous communities and car manufacturers.
According to the Head of Government , this plan allows gas to be reduced by 6 % on average in the case of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, leading to a "strong increase" in the authorisations which increased by 40 per cent in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid the first edition of the International Classic Car Fair will be held, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of engines.
This exhibition will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in Pabellón de Cristal der Casa de Campo in Madrid.
On an exhibition site of 20,000 square meters 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will present their brands.
Not only can you look at classic motorcycles and vehicles, but you will also find all earthly items related to the world of motors at ClassicAuto Madrid.
In this way you can find accessories, spare parts, components, materials accessories, accessories, publications, miniatur autos, etc. at the exhibition.
Hundreds of articles from the world of classical motors, which will delight the collectors and lovers.

There are also skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles on a specially designed race track in the auvé area of the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally sustainable sport
Mazda wants to prove that sport is fully compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the engine's automatic stop and drive system, baptized on the name i-stop, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 stands out through its good notes in the overall picture.
The final process, the performance of the vehicle, the comfort, its street behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" at the new Mazda3.
Starting at the front seat, you can find that the front seats offer an excellent ergonomics and a good hold.
In addition, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
In further consideration of the unit consisting of the instrument table and the armature board, it can be found that Mazda, with a variety of buttons and switches, is red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us partly of the style of the Honda Civics.
This is why it can be said that both the Mazda 3, as well as the Civic, both Japanese models, are separated from the nakedness of the German cars, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to exceed.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than the appropriate comfort so that four adults can drive too easily with the car.
All of this comes with a thicker and clearly shaped suitcase space.
The stop and approach system is now only available for the 2 litre petrol engine with 150 PS and a 6-pass switch.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out by its fineness, by its quiet noise, by its performance and by its low consumption.
And all those who do not travel many kilometres a year should consider this i-stop with a petrol engine because of its gross comfort in walking and low consumption, even if at Mazda the diesel models are the most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the sample is a specialty, as it has a significantly larger number of elements from the series equipment.
The series equipment is primarily designed by the driver for the change of driving (RVM) to eliminate the dead angle, as well as the control elements for the traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive internal level, the board computer with a rough screen, the parking sensors, an independent air-conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio bluetooth as well as the chromed 17-inch spots.
Furthermore, this version also includes, as if it was not yet equipped, the Premium package, which contains the following for additional 1,500 Euros: in addition to other elements, especially the capable bixenon scanners and the sound system BOSE with CD chargers.
Error
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, due to its driving behaviour and the diversity of equipment.
Moreover, those who do not have many kilometres back per year can also buy the i-stop version that is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
The only negative on this model is, however, a slightly higher price, which lies between 21.770 Euro for the model Luxury and 23270 Euro for the tested model Sportive.
However, the Mazda3 offers us the new highest driving pass every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls the red carpet of sensitivity for Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine" the stars, dressed in models that look just as elegant as sexy, more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, decided for a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is too limited to be able to read only his e-mails without any possibility of seeing certain attachments or surfing the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
It is more unlikely to see it on the street, but the idea of itself is, however, above all, for young people of interest.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek only costs very little and has a very cheap flatrate, for example only half the price of the flatrate of an iPhone.
After seeing the success, the company has placed two new devices on the market: one, which is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free data service, in contrast to the peak, where you have to pay a six-fold higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and therefore its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, however, has prepared a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, approximately 12 Euros per month, includes roaming for Europe as a whole.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to ignore all the data in order to read their emails as soon as you have crossed the border or if you are looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with a phone).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly misleading and should have been possible for a long time.
It is already true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign residences, but my experience requires a doctorate title in physics and a good glasses to read all the small prints.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission on the availability of roaming tariffs for Europe has almost always been ignored.
Beyond your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and that is right.
That a small device like FonPeek (but it is always surprising that it has the name Fon, although it does not have Wi-Fi) can offer this type of tariffs means that the phone providers are slow but sure to think and start considering different possibilities as to how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example for this, in its prices it includes downloading books and other queries on the Internet.
No fights and no hooks.
This is an Internet-enabled device and only one time is paid for it, i.e. at the time of the purchase, not a month for a month.
And that's exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a shopping option with lifelong internet access as it already offers the peak in the United States.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails on the phone, thank you.
Except I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Festive Colour of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Even at the entry of Barack Obama as President of the United States, they appeared in a dress and coat of this color and again chose the same color to accompany him at his, no doubt, the second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has carried very similar models on both occasions: above that it was almost the same color - a shiny yellow - there was the clothing made of three parts - clothing, jackets and clothing made of the same fabric, and to that she wore something coarsely or a necklace.
It goes even so far that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress at more than just one occasion.
However, the two clothes are very different in the fabric they are made from.
At the opening of the office, she wore a dress from the top and in Oslo a patterned Samt.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with semi-trailers and for the second time a similar model, but gold colours.
The hair was also different every time: the hair was high on this occasion as a hair cut, and in the previous time she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who want children.
This results in the study "Fruitability and Career of Women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9.737 women aged between 15 and 75 leaves no doubt as to whether 75% of women in employment see their careers on the labour market as a result of their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are gross differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, depending on whether women work or not, and if so, what kind of profession they practice.
Those of them who do no other activity outside the house work only half a day or have no fixed employment contract will become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women move with a firm position, especially in the public sector, to establish a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age with a fixed employment receive their first child on average only 3.7 years after the relationship, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with fixed employment who have used longer to achieve this and who have connected it and the first child have achieved much later.
Also, the type of work has a gross influence on the motherhood, although less than the calendar with regard to the reception preparation," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account at the age of women in the household and the first child.
According to survey, the age is much higher at the time of the hierate and the first child, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be found in women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they have only the primary school or higher education, on average with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
In addition, depending on their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women with the primary degree degree are already married before their first degree and have their first child, the women with a middle or high degree degree of education are getting around, and they're just looking for a degree degree and they're getting married and then they're getting their first degree, Delgado says.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name: Diane Kruger.
From the coming year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertisement "Because you are worth it".
The leading performer from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at international level, will become another famous sign, like before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her was the last to join this exclusive club, the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millionaire").
Among the men, the cosmetic company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Sport of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today, met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
For this reason they all appeared.
The ex-Model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen as the best model this year.
The Poker Game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, images by Fernando Vicente) three-bit X-rays of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fearsome genre (kurst biography, life and work), but is looking for a similarity to the glowing piece of the Creator's heart.
The trip is exciting and Vicent does not save on fear or enlightenment.
Auver, that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving call to read and read again and again.
Here are some cuts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his pages, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt, without having found any words of joy in contrast to the ungodly fate, moral without guilt and guilt without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christ, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, had, between inpower and ignorance, with an overwhelming poetic humour, without any sense, like the sorcerers who almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was joined by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirty years, in the arms of Dermaveen, in which the emotions in her flesh, because of the breakup of her marriage, were united with the pleasure of reue, a spiritual privilege that existed to come into heaven on the path of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was released in 1922 by Sylvia Beach in Paris. It is one of the 8,000 peaks in the world literature, one has to climb up on the north wall, on the wall, where the best mountain climbers are constantly trying again."
About William Faulkner: "It was a comical bitch.
He sometimes said about himself that he would be the heir of a landowner and once again he said that he would be the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams bore witness to a certain Grobe."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the insane cry, which was taken out of a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo would continue in his literary way until the night of the 20th century.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled down and prayed: My dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power to finally stop writing a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses are enthralled by Spencer: ' the sleep after the effort,/ after the thirst of the port,/ the peace after the war,/ after a sat life you will find a chance to die."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she always had her depressions.
The husband took it completely normal when she told him that Eduard VII was spying on her between the Azales or singing the birds in Greek.
It is not the only other case known where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotician whose literary talent was still much more gross than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do when trying to drown Joyce in Baroja?
What was Benet’s intention if he did not bring Baroja into the arms of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the man's fame, so that he could put himself on this podium?"
Feige Aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother walked through our village in Fuenlabrada, where suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 lived next to her and our dog, our dog was a mixture we had taken out of the zoo and the only one weighed six pounds, and then out of the sky they missed him two steps and hurt him hard.
Our equipment cannot be put into words, as it is incomprehensible to us, because the fungus is supposed to be a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was, of course, carried out on the line.
To that end, the torture that a woman who went on a pleasant walk got when she wanted to justify these persons because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a foolish person attacks a dog, he may also become the same with a woman, a child, an older man, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place in a normally quiet city district at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very usual service day.
The dog's been healing all day.
Of course, we have replaced a display in a nearby police station, but we still have great doubts whether this is going to bring about anything at all and in order to prevent any prejudices from the beginning, we would just like to make it clear that the clever criminals were Spanish.
Our equipment about the incident has prompted us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what needs to be done in the minds of these young people to find a cheap attack on a helpless animal, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helmets
In cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Transport Safety (Fesvial), the tire manufacturer Michelin has launched a campaign to promote helm use, especially in the case of the younger motorcyclists, as both companies have announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helm use, as it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "is much more comprehensive than the design and manufacture of products that are becoming more and more secure with each day" and further confirmed that they also contribute to bringing this goal closer to each day with other actions of educational and informative character.
This new campaign to promote helm use on the motorcycle running under the slogan 'To be or not to be' will be distributed in a first phase poster to over 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that transport safety is "a constant care" of the company, and precisely because of the reason that it is always committed as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles that one of its main objectives must be the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small trucks is increasing a bit again
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles approved in November in Spain represent an increase of 12,6 % in relation to the year 2008, and, what is even more important, they are the first growth after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, depending on the figures presented by the Anfac manufacturer association and the Ganvam car dealer association.
However, these good figures are currently only to be taken into account with great caution, as the reference data for November 2008 were a particularly bad year with a 60% decrease in the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total authorisations of these 11 months remain 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but all vehicles from which the small transport market consists include: passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small delivery cars and lighter passenger cars/cars.
Furthermore, the same weather clouds are still in the sky, which most of the demand is accompanied, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, the gross share of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises that make purchases with third-party financing in almost 100 % of all cases.
This means that these restrictions, which are the consequences of the reverse monetary situation of credit institutions, need to include further factors, such as the increase in unemployment rates or the decline in the poor economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the Plan 2000E has not helped.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, even self-employed and small companies have a right to purchase a small carrier up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 output which may not exceed 160 grams per km of running, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam recalled that it was absolutely necessary for the State to focus on these small loads as well as, of course, on industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The Association of Auto Traders Prophesy for 2010 is a year similar to the one just past, for which it is estimated to be 19% with a sales deficit (in the case of passenger cars and parking cars).
Support for brake controls in critical situations is now mandatory
As already with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as it now happens with the stability control ESP, the emergency braking aid systems have to be provided in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all new authorised passenger cars and small passenger transporters, and for the rest of the vehicles a quarantine period has been set by the end of February 2011.
The European Union's adoption has the aim of improving the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many accidents because of their way of working.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake control, which the system recognizes by the brake force performed by the driver on the brake pedal.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to a survey commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one third of the drivers involved in an accident were no longer allowed to enter the brake pedal and half of them had not been completely stopped.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the other hand, the brake aid enters the brake system with maximum force and thus reduces the brake time and therefore also the brake distance which a car will be delayed during the brake operation.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents each year in which pedestrians are damaged could be prevented if all cars with this type of emergency brake assistants were equipped.
There would be even less accidents - one expects that every fourth accident could be prevented with personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (over radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts afterwards, the system will help him increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the combination is already inevitable, the brake assistant shall exert the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors shifts the plan for Opel until January
While the team of the Opel work in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April, probably on 8th, said Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer indicates that he needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the site concerned already has its consent to each point of the plan.
For this reason, the final document, which will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be moved by the beginning of 2010.
However, it is ensured by GM that a decision will be made in the coming days regarding the sale of Saab.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on American autobuilders to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM agrees to contact some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports car, which has the Russian group Converg back cover, is becoming stronger and stronger.
If none of these buyers were to enter into an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to sleep Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
In the control of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their newest and very expensive jewels, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and really made it easier to make it at 80 kilos, making it only 1,275 kilos on the scale now.
In order to create such a thing, they refused, as the first one, the automatic drop-down roof, which was replaced by a ceiling roof with a manual drive, saving 21 kilos alone; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as the GT3 "disappear" more 15 times; with the exception of the air conditioning system, the fuel tank has been reduced from 64 to 54 litres, thereby saving another 7 kilos; the installation of sports baccquet seats once again 12 times and five times with the light 19-inch traps.
Then again, the loss of the CDR-30 audio system was reduced by six kilos and the exchange of the door handles by grips from the fabric reached the missing kilo.
Although it is also available with the double-deployed PDK, the sample was carried out with a vehicle with 6-passed handrails, mainly on the smaller terrains of California, on mountain routes that were really very curly.
In his driving behaviour, he can only give him the notes without a taddel.
The reduction in its weight, however, has nothing to do with the fact that it would no longer be so safe on the Stravé.
It is rather the opposite of the case: for a long time we have no longer experienced such a small and light model, which also gives a feeling of gross safety at the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete to be able to make his muscles warm at a low pace in the necessary time until we give him the orders to shave, brake, relax and then bring everything out of his engine again ...
He does everything you say to him. The car does everything we show him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to his drive, which is as communicative as precise as it is.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all taste directions
The sound of its V6 boxer with 320 PS (10 more than the Boxster S) has been very successful and you can increase it with the 'sport' option as well as through a system that can change the engine noise, which has already been used for the first time in Panama.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginable brutal, no matter whether out of the stand or in the renewed acceleration.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country streets on which we drove with the boxster Spyder was already pretty damaged, but the car mastered the bolt holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route; and though we found ice in some of these curves in the morning and roll break in the morning.
In summary, it can be said that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pass, as it is probably more rare and has much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will come to the market in February 2010 and cost 70,831 EURO.
Bug Girl
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Cocoon cosmetic line and an opportunity star at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck stiffness as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", it's a "Bag Girl".
The Basconia presents itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 at his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electrica and thus comes first within his group after Mirza Teletovic's spectacular performance, which was with eight triples of the best of his team (29 in the review).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the major failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of use and teamwork, even if they were waiting for the bitter end of their victory.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the Blaurots, who from the beginning sat at the top of the display table.
Since the first four bodies of the team from Vitoria had already come out of the perimeter, one could already recognize that they had come to the field with well-heated gloves.
It was English and Teletovic, who were primarily responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was almost different, only that the team from Álava decided to play an indoor game of Barac and to play by Elijahhu, who was received on his return to the team with pipes and applause, which is his home to further expand its benefit until the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" evaluation of splitter already indicated that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the obvious advantage in the break, the game was not yet decided and the Maccabees wanted to remember once again that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the ever-increasing "Hand of Elias" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini strongly contributed to the "Gelben" turning the rudder (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but everything else than dead, had to prepare a few toy suits with meeting security to get air again and at one of them suddenly came the Mirza Teletovic gun, which with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas, made sure that the display table again showed a satisfying distance of (54-67) which the host could be decorated at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alaves were bluffed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take back the victory they had earned in the first three and a half minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, who did not do their best and tried to give their team power back by three points from the line (70-77).
However, and although splitter was put out of place due to fraud, Ivanovic's team did not quit, and the Israelis did well and even though the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Infringements prevented Unicaja from offering the stench
Unicaja lost loudness in Greece against Olympiacos and had to retire the leader in Group B of the Euroliga, and that was in a game that was marked by the adventures of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially during the internal game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The Málaga team was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship or of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of Europe's strongest and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their game offered in the first quarter, the Andalusians could begin to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the host bled with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the unicija itself, even though the domestic team with an internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Shortsanitis made it possible that the display table showed its favor in the 13th minute 22-20, the minutes in which it would have come almost to the battle between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and therefore both were disqualified.
The Greek team began to get warm and its superiority over both parts of the game, while leaving England Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three mistakes caused by Carlos Jiménez's own fault left clear traces behind the Unicaja.
Among its players in the interior and Lithuanian predecessor Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
An uplift was impossible
The third game district was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which proved to be superior despite his 19 losses and even managed to compensate for the difference in the game carried out in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which led the group back into the swing.
Unicaja tried to move away from the many accidents and the exclusion of Robert Archibald's wounded shoes during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31 minutes thanks to the spring and the triples of Cook and the use of Lewis, there was hope of 66-57 again.
However, it was actually impossible because the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, was not to be stopped.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute, and Unicaja had to beat himself and had to drop the lead on Olympiacos.
How much should you earn due to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now, thanks to the new Trovit application, the search engine with most ads of properties, offers of jobs and cars in Spain, learn their value they should earn because of their profile.
The "How much should you earn?" tool calculates the user's salaries on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. The user has a Facebook form that can enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after one week after the application was first available, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average "slightly paid", explains the responsible for the product, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross amount of EUR 45.226 and a French 31.059, in contrast to the EUR 24,000 that a Spaniard earns.
As a result, an Lkw professional has an annual net amount of 34.247 euros in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst work paid in Spain is that of a basement with a net of 11,592 euros annually; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after places on the Internet in the last three months are one driver, half-days and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay in her message in Tegucigalpa.
The President of the Office shall leave diplomatic representation by 27 January 2010 at the latest if his mandate expires officially.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" had had to leave before that date the message he had found since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to go on January 27th, as his mandate runs on this day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The envoy also quoted the former presidents, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the appointed date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the return of the government of Brazil," Zelaya explained on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (with which Porfirio Lobo was the winner), Zelaya assured him that he would remain in the Brazilian message until January.
However, he tried to take refuge in Brazil this week.
This, however, failed to recognize Zelayas' refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeker who wanted to force him to "de facto" government under the chairmanship of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the darkest days of the past spring, in which the inflation of the assets was the dominant mood on the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is in no way surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the brokers make decisions about one of nature from an uncertain future.
The assumption used to stabilise the markets was to compare the debt with the direct purchase of assets and to indirectly release the liquidity free hand at interest rates that were moving around zero so as to buy the banks assets to abate in this way.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are as good as finished and, without questioning their heterodox policy on liquidity, start to aim for something sand in the drive, as the ECB has already seen with its annual increase next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox assumptions, and we will be witnessing a change in the reduction of risk premiums.
The fluctuations of the stock exchanges and the differences in the company bonds are increasing again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States saw themselves forced to make public private risks and to raise public debt again.
It is now re-establishing quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, leading to an increase in the differences in the eurozone countries in terms of Germany.
Spain had so far barely been affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision below regarding the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not harm to bring the defenders of the moral risk to silence, who again tried to raise awareness among the world economic policy leaders of what they had caused, as they had the devastating effects of limiting loans to the loss of jobs when they had actually decided a new day to thank them.
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai is a tribal war between the Egyptians in order to restore power in the Emirates and development in Greece has already been foreseen.
A government that denies public debt, elections, and a new government that pulls the same strain.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary will save from non-compliance with its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus a euro-Member State will no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens with the need for over-ordinary measures in order to maintain the stability of government funds.
Yes, we find ourselves as expected before an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some imbalances on too high amounts, that would now be within the expectation.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonds.
However, if European differences are to be reduced and the Spanish continue to increase, then this would be a special Spanish risk.
The standard & Poor's is a farce. While the above-mentioned indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to predict their scenarios for recovery and correct their scenario for 2011 above, including the OECD and the European Commission, which again comes with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this warning does not promise a long life.
Again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although it is said in the moment "preview when driving".
Related Strings
The president of Iberdola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, appeared as the first yesterday before Parliament's sub-committee, where the strategy on Spain's energy supply will be discussed in the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán of the press gave some points about what he had put behind closed doors to the Subcommittee.
According to the President of Iberdola, Spain must invest by 2020 50 billion Euro and another 60 billion from that date until 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60 billion, but would amount to 95 billion.
However, Iberdola believes that there should be no more investment in increasing energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international associations.
By 2020, the issue will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture facilities and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case, it is expected that 18,000 MW will be needed more, under the prefabrication of course through other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft legislation for a sustainable economy, which was just adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has called for, did not want to say anything against this law about how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his view, "in the long term, you clearly set out in this direction, despite some "individuals", as the president of Iberdola called it.
As it is, Galán believes that decisions on investments, even if they are long-term, should be made, as it will take some time and a stable compensation framework is needed to tackle them.
Ferrovial receives the "handling" from Aer Lingus on ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, Switzerland’s Swiss sport, is the preferred partner of the Irish Aer Lingus Flus company for luggage service at ten European airports on which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, to which no figures have yet been announced, shall be drawn up for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares have signed a protocol yesterday to cooperate with the creation of an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans investments of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to investigate energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtiv and Bouygues for its first road construction in Australia
Actiona fights for the approval of its first highway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The building is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about EUR 1,047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German high level are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for actiona to establish itself as a construction company in the country and as a road operator.
The city administration wants to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration for public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) had decided to advance the project in accordance with a business plan set up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and mural management.
In view of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly from European construction companies, competing with each other in the last phase.
The group named Transcity is led by Actiona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second is located in Italy, one of the best specialists for underground construction.
Against the team of Actiona, the Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructures and the French building group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium, which is in the closer choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Lightton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtivt, which is part of ACS), which also owns the domestic Baulderstone (in the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises powerful construction and privatisations, however, has a hard to overcome, since only by buying a domestic construction company has access.
A strategy which is followed by the above-mentioned companies, either high-level or car-fingered, in addition to Asian references, and which must only be followed by the Spanish construction agents.
Even ACS has gained access on this market only by its participation of 30% to the highest level, owner of the mentioned Lightton.
Active millions
Actiona is of utmost importance to this geographical area for the sector, where it is already well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the sewerage industry.
Among other assets, it has already grown its windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies that have been commissioned to build and manage Adelaide's disposal facility with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the two areas of construction and infrastructure.
The underground road, supported by the Brisbane Infrastructure Office and raised Northern Link, aims to connect the western motorway in Toowong with the surrounding road in Kelvin Grove (see map) to a length of 5 kilometres through the tunnel. This is the rough roadway to guide the roads of Brisbane.
The roadmap issued by the city administration is scheduled for the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this road is already intended to open up for transport in the last months of 2014, it is expected that construction works will take place until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
He has two tracks in each direction, an electronic walling system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland participates in financing with 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million).
For high level, Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia gives high priority, which yesterday signed a contract with the government of 154 million, again and again considerable orders.
The ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with glass fibre cable by means of its home subsidiary Lightton.
This improvement will create a fast internet access for 400,000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the King George Tower construction project with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction has not yet begun and has received 129 million for this.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment amounted to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has made use of its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2,1 kilometres long for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64,5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the aid for construction work to expand the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria) over 130 million.
Thus, Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of construction work is planned for early 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore gets a piece of Renfe
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services for the next two years by Mrs. Rushmore over a sum of about three million euros a year, the railway company announced.
In this contract, there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies, who presented themselves to this competition awarded by Renfe, of which 4 came to the end, among them TBWA, who was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be commissioned with the design and production of the campaigns.
Penalties over 63 million for France Télécom because of the interruption of competition.
France Télécom, the regulatory authority for competition in France, has imposed a fine of more than 63 million euros for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition on fixed networks and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and trust programmes for consumers on the border of the regulation.
Together with this penalty, the former French monopoly and still state companies have collected more than €560 million in fines since 1994 due to the disability of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, since the authority that is waiting for competition is of the opinion that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and has therefore become remiss again.
Trade in application
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company follows the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application page on the Internet to increase revenue from business that does not stem from the telephone connection.
In principle, this website is active by Orange in France and the United Kingdom.
Until 2010, we have to wait for this page to be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has introduced Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476.4 million.
The Champions League has since its inception in 1992 developed a source of revenue for the football club.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million, which brings them the third and fifth place of the football club that earned most of the money in the league.
Leader of this list is Manchester United.
Leader of this list is Manchester United.
The UEFA Champions League won, not only brings fame to itself. It is also one of the main revenue sources of the major associations.
According to UEFA, the League has distributed up to EUR 5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (of which 12 are Spanish) which have participated in this event since its establishment in the 1992/93 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The wife club is in third place in Europe, which earned most of the money through its participation and the only one who won the trophies three times next to AC Milan.
The leading Catalan master and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 is the fifth place.
The lists lead to Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also took the most money through their participation in the last Champoins League.
And that, even though they lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third of the countries that could take money through the Champions, although it has more titles than all the others (five, unlike four bee Italy, three with England and two with Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated payment allocation procedure used by UEFA.
In this financial year, the organisation, whose chairman, Michel Platini, has entered, will receive 1,090 million by the Champions League.
From this money, UEFA 413.1 million is available for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualification course (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who won a participation received 3.8 million due to their blue presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they fought.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 Euros) and for an undecided (400,000 per team). The clubs that have arrived at the eighth final will receive three million each; the four who have arrived at the fourth final, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, unlike the second, which receives 5.2 million.
Thus, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and at least 31.2 million on fixed incomes.
Barça earned 2.5 million in August with his victory at the European Supercup.
However, the variable payments for which 337,8 million are provided are still available.
This money is given in proportion to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 allocated seats.
The master of last year receives 40% of the amount allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games they play in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in sos
The Group of Nueva Rumasa has been able to ensure yesterday's details of the purchase offer of shares with which it wants to acquire an upper limit of between 25 and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not force it to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share, which is paid up to ten years and with an interest rate of 1 % annually due to this shift.
Yesterday the sos shares were closed at 1.85 euros, so Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to New Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real evaluation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz Group gives shareholders a 15-day period to notify their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed about this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had come into contact with the Authority.
At the end, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to structure its management.
In the attempt to remain in the range of possible purchase offers and the legal sources of his former manager, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal audit.
A decision to become the first woman to hold a high position in the food business.
It is a newly created post that is directly supported by the Group's chairman.
This is all other than free from polemik, because the company is involved in a judicial battle because of the suspicion of the conversion of more than 230 million sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will transfer further capital over the next few months.
With regard to Salazar's credit, the former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ágel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) arrived yesterday before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the movement of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public invitation to tender submitted by the investment company Mer to exclude Paternina
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public invitation to tender submitted by the investment company Mer to Federico Paterina on 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this invitation after it had been demonstrated that the conditions of the law could be complied with and therefore the content of the accompanying document, as amended by the last two December, could be considered "enough".
CNMV also announced that this offer for the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paterina at the price of 7.65 Euro per share, which is around 8.95 % of the company's capital, which consists of 6,142,786 Euros in the shares granted by Madrid and Bilbao.
Furthermore, it was also announced that 5,592,778 million shares were fixed which could not be transferred in any way until the conclusion of the tender and whose price of Federico Paterina was fixed in accordance with the law.
New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days of accidents and accidents, not only do the KFZ workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles that have been created in an accident are dragged into workshops where a customer has to assess the damage caused and the cost of repair.
No single accident is the same as calculating the costs for the parts and hours of work can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between EUR 20,000 and EUR 30,000 per hand, including parts and hours of work, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest IT tools it is a question of minutes
For this reason, almost 100 % of customers use these types of systems.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and maintenance collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process them afterwards and offer their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Auditex, part of the American Group of Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The two other companies that compete with the tool market for the evaluation and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is all but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales manager of Audatex, it is co-operated with 63 manufacturers and importers, each providing the information in a different format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed is growing to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have come into the market than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new car arrives on the market, the company will start working.
It is a difficult task, because each of the thousands of vehicles must be catagolysed and their price entered.
In addition, each model creates a "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" various parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much sold model, the work can be completed in one week if the process progresses rapidly.
If it is a less useful car, it can take up to three or four months. At present, Auditex has 99.2% of the cars distributed in Spain with full information.
For example, the exclusive models include information about Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the road car park, it is more than 99 %.
For the purposes of the execution of documentation works and the production of databases, Auditex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technicians (usually experts for mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Auditex invests EUR 90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Each month they collect 2.5 million data and their customers get updates every second day.
The development of this huge flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the error or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about the value of the vehicles used in Spain is Eurotax.
Auditex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
In the review of the products offered by Auditex, you can easily provide an overview of the type of support they provide to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, while the star of the AudaPlus products is a standard solution for the recovery of accidents for the guests.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
Over the cost of the parts, it contains the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or the paint price.
This tool is paid according to the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
Most expensive it will be for customers who rarely use it, up to ten times a month, namely 5,75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company, which manufactures thousands of opinions, negotiates the price with audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it came from the assembly band.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle discs, and AudaSubbastas is an open service on the Internet for the trade market, with which you can provide for vehicles that have been declared to be totally damaged.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or for obtaining information on the deviations to the brand and model.
For example, it is possible to examine how many models of a particular car brand had to be put into the workshop or how many of them had been turned into a serious accident within a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes among other Gt estimates, which is also intended for customers and provides the same type of digital images, access to shares or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group which was established in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, damage or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT leader for opinions is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 guests and 53 insurance companies.
In the last three years, its turnover has increased by 20% annually and by EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of the last year, they began to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
On the other hand, audatex was founded in 1966 in Germany and was founded in 1979 in Spain.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business in Europe and the rest of the world are carried out, and the remaining 38% are in North and South America. They work together with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The total turnover in the world of the Solera Group (Audex, Sidex, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) is $557 million, 3.35 more than in 2008.
To this end, the company has revenues of EUR 19.1 million, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion at the stock exchange and today their shares are traded at a value of 2.4 billion dollars.
Since 2007, they have been at the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Reference Index Standard & Poor.
Increase of car accidents on the Internet
In October, the Solara Autoonline group purchased a platform on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59,5 million for 85 % of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15 % next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value-added services, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service exclusively applies to industry professionals, such as insurance companies, customers, car rental companies, workshops, scrapyards and car dealers, who must be allowed to register in front of their activities.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of which alone in Germany.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 guests today.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added on the Spanish market.
According to the Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose driving licence number has been registered must no longer be on the road, but certain undamaged parts may be used as spare parts.
However, cars with historical value may be allowed again, even if they have been registered after difficult authorities.
Proposal for a workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Auditex ensures that the user receives a cost proposal in just four steps:identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, creation and creation of a cost proposal.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince older professionals who are normally more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 parking cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small transporters and 44 trucks.
Of course you need a computer with Internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by the vehicle identification number, a graph of the respective model appears and then the required replacement part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for working hours, discounts or discounts and then he can print the proposal and pass it on to his customers.
AudaTaller is, however, not a tool for evaluating such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that this does not include estimated working hours targeted at the workshop.
The cost of use for this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can pay without further payment.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to be able to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that auto mechanics have long been waiting for, for example, to choose a door and then completely turn the picture around to look at the inside.
