Inflation, in Europe, has come up with food
The accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 euro area countries was higher than in the forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, indicating the Office for Statistics of the European Community located in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the United States, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not decrease the direct interest rate by saying that lower interest rates, with higher commodity prices and lower unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but close to two per cent.
According to one analyst, it is the Catch 22 for the ECB: "It is necessary to deter" inflation so as not to have any further action on this issue.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is a record over the past 12 years and in Spain, it is raised from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has declined due to the rapid increase in food and energy prices.
The market price for cereals increased by 88 per cent and the soybean price also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased considerably in 2007.
This year, the world oil price increased by 52 percent, and last month, a silver barrel cost nearly $100.
According to the ECB, the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 in 2008 to 2.5 per cent this year, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to the analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3%, but the next 3-4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce its management rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (The Alliance of Young Democrats) has increased significantly since December. Thus, since 2002, it has now had the largest number of participants, while Gallup (the Institute of Survey) has never before found such little socialist support, i.e. 13 percent.
For faithful voters, the difference would be, due to the largest determination of the opposition voters, a support of more than two thirds (71 per cent) against the support of a fifth (20 per cent) for the MSZP (Hungary Socialist Party).
According to the survey, the MDF (Hungarian Democrat Forum) and the SZDSZ (Free Democrats Alliance) are below the parliamentary threshold: their support is two percent throughout the population.
Of the faithful electors some will vote, the number of participants from the two parties increased by 1 per cent.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate from the lowest point in the past, the proportion of those who felt that the country's economic situation was particularly severe has never been as high, it rose 41 per cent and, according to 46 per cent additional, the situation was quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population is forecasting aggravation and only a tenth is expected to improve the situation.
In December, 71 per cent of the surveyed, i.e. a majority never seen in Gallup's previous polls, considered that the prime minister was doing his job rather than well.
13 percent of polls trust or trust much in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54% do not fully trust the Prime Minister and 27% to the President of Fidesz.
One indicator of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that discontent with the Prime Minister can be treated without change in government.
While after October, 35 per cent of the polls wanted the government and the prime minister to remain in office, this rate is now only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believes that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of the intention to vote, 60 per cent of the polls answered that they would certainly vote and 20 per cent additionally said that they would probably vote.
In order to make the comparison, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 percent of the polls would certainly participate and 15 percent more likely would participate. Following the current intentions, the outcome of the referendum would be no doubt.
74 per cent of people would say no to registration rights in higher education, 79 per cent would say no to consultation costs and 84 per cent would say no to hospital stay costs.
When we look at only the same proportions among those who have expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters would reject the introduction of registration rights, consultation costs and hospital stay costs.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost 20 percent
The hypermarkets located in the Budaörs trade triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 per cent last year compared to the fact that this year's VAT rate did not increase.
Article of Napi Myrkag (Dayly Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual Christmas basket also increased by 16 per cent on average, with a significantly higher value than a thousand furnaces in all hypermarkets.
The prices, which had already been shipped to the major food stores in December, have no longer increased brutally compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that the items bought clearly below nine thousand forts last year now cost more than ten thousand forts.
The Daily Cart in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded at least 91 furnaces, the psychological threshold of ten thousand furnaces.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forts.
(In 2003, this value was 6 800 forts.)
The prices of the Unicum and the living fish remained almost at last year's level, but the prices of the dende, the nuts and the peacock have increased considerably.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread was found at 139 pounds.
Competition has not reduced the price of the product below 200 furnaces.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forts, so it only cost 257 forts the bottle included in it.
It does not prevent that this year, at the end of the daily basket, Auchan was the cheapest and the cheapest Cora.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its daily Cart by 15%, while Tesco and Auchan increased them by approximately 18% and 18% respectively.
By comparing the cheapest basket last year and the cheapest basket this year, we find a 12 per cent difference, while the difference between the cheapest basket last year and the cheapest basket this year is 21 per cent.
Prices increased by 1,480 on average.
Last year, prices increased by 1,206 on average, while the impact of the increase in VAT rates was already seen in last year's Christmas prices.
This process has made trade more complicated, hypermarkets could not clearly determine the scope of application to products as long as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he may lose a significant profit on the margin appropriate to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the increase in the daily Cartagena prices has evolved in such a way that the cheapest cart was more than 1 720 forts than the value of 2006 while the difference between the least expensive carts was only 844 forts.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the cheapest basket was more than 1,630 forges in the last year and prices at least increased by 1,284 forges in the last year as well.
By approaching the two Christmas season, we have seen a catastrophic price increase, in less than 20 months the daily consumption prices have increased by more than 30% in the hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for some first-time food, the Statistics Institute has found an increase in prices of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, of flour and eggs.)
According to the Daily Cart of the latter, this seems almost absurd because the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by almost 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indicators, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to accept the brutal increase in prices also by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, the hypermarkets don't complain, they always record good years.
According to our experience, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take the food of long preservation by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, important queues were formed in the three hypermarkets cash registers, as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the number of business is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to research companies that they do not even reach the expected number of business, not only for food but also for sustainable consumption.
Many hospitals make the economy of disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the misuse of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
Hospitals' hygiene conditions, insufficient number of beds, overload of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the doctor in charge of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also make the economy of disinfectants
A MRSA infection has not long been diagnosed in the János hospital trauma service.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detected on a hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The disease has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injury from a serious car accident came out of the hospital but shortly after it had to return because of a MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have not been able to perform an important operation because of the bacteria in their body.
Until 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, a doctor at the National Epidemiology Centre.
It is known that it is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen who has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSAs, in other words by staphylococcus aureus resistant to methylylline oxacilline.
A third of the people are carriers of the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as angina, amygdalitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily cured.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a well resistant bacteria that will spread rapidly in poor hospital conditions.
In the case of temporary or prolonged immunosuppression of the immune system, this bacteria may cause serious hospital infections, such as trauma or septic infection, on the elderly, small weights or with a weakened body.
According to hospital manager János, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily hospital routine.
In particular, the infection must not be confused with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only or we do not search for it, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the caring staff wear rubber gloves and protective masks, and we have appropriate antibiotics to care for them," Tibor Nyulasi said.
In priority, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, however the infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample sampling is not in mode
The large majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and residences for elderly people, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients who carry MRSA.
However, microbiological collection is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these reviews.
Most cases see only the day if MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, the doctor in charge of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian directives for the management of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts should be made to target antibiotic therapy, in other words microbiological examinations should be carried out in order to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take into account.
Microbiological sampling is even more rare in outpatient and basic care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals make the economy of disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA produces one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, to wear gloves and protective masks. However, important gaps are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by infection transmitted by inhalation of gouttelettes and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the contaminated disease cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, beds are often too close to each other while in the end of the epidemic, the patients should be separated from each other by at least 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, make savings on disinfectants, they lack nurses, the sick are many, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is less demonstrable or the proliferation of pathogen agent may be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant costs for social security funds, which is why we are fighting this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a programme to prevent or reduce the impact of MRSAs.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) shows among its priorities the prevention of the impact of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, author of a fatal accident, was not in a state of emergency.
The official findings concerning the fatal accident caused by the 22nd roundabout commissioner were drawn up.
It may be ruled out that the Commissioner of the 22nd roundabout, a resignation from his post, who has broken a pedestrian by causing his death on Tuesday, would have led to an invresce or storm, reported on Friday Attila Morvai, spokesperson of the Ministry of the State of the Capital after the relative statement was established.
The findings confirmed the first result of the investigation that the former commissioner had already found that he had not consumed alcohol before taking the wheel.
On Tuesday last Tuesday, the former commissioner of the 22nd roundabout broke down a 55-year-old man who was facing him when he turned, with his personal car, into the 22nd roundabout Kossuth Lajos Street. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing the passage for pedestrians.
(On the other hand, the fact that he crossed the road outside the pedestrian passage does not constitute an attenuating circumstance, according to the Road Code a car that starts a turn must let the pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and requested his retirement because, according to the police communication, he was greatly disturbed by the accident.
The investigation into this case is carried out by the Investigator of Budapest.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated from the outset with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
EUR 400 million additional for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Minister of Finance, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements in Budapest on Friday with a total value of EUR 400 million on a credit line to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the financial financing of Hungarian transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund with a credit agreement of EUR 100 million already signed by the parties.
The €150 million credit agreement also covers the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total amount of EUR 300 million for Hungary, the remaining EUR 150 million will be used later, as a result of the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a 50 million euro contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope first as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
In the course of the negotiations, draft line 4 of the metro was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would renegotiate the possible modification of the initial contract when Hungary has completed the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of EUR 8.4 billion for financing 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB shall grant its appropriations according to the EURIBOR interest rate, with a maturity of 8 years and without a commitment commission.
Bulgaria, EU real estate market paradise
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, and the attention of the whole of Europe is focused on this country of the Balkans, which has not been mentioned in the past.
What, or who bought in this EU market that is always the least expensive but will quickly become cheap?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
Currently, in the real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the largest target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on the edge of the good sea.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, on the sea side, Albéna, the "Sables d'Or", the "Côte du sun", the former Sozopol and Nessebar, but they are increasingly looking for an apartment in the Kavarna and Balcik region as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also raise the interest of investors, and they are also increasingly buying in the very expensive corner of Russia.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, commercial and office surfaces promise the highest rate of amortization.
Bulgaria is the best way to become one of Europe's most attractive golf gardens and thus a priority destination, after the summer and winter season, also in the two other seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying an apartment in Bulgaria are at the same time trying to change their lifestyle, their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English but others arrive from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, there are traditionally many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to install are buying renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, the proximity of a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary residences (since last December Bulgaria is mentioned among the first 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving a higher value in the medium or long term.
The price of the capital's buildings increases continuously as a result of a growing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, these last 5 years have increased by 21% each year.
The increase in real estate prices is mainly higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, professional meetings will end on Tuesday, however, on Wednesday, after the official opening, the ministers' negotiations on the post-2012 climate regime will continue.
Political experts and men from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap to define efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At this point, lively discussions were held between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, at the moment, they did not wish to discuss the exact figures, but were ready to sign a reduction agreement by 2020 for greenhouse gas emissions of 25 to 40 per cent compared to 1990 levels.
Another important subject of the conference is whether developed countries commit themselves, without reducing emissions, to providing financial and technological assistance to the countries that need it.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a board of 16 members likely within the framework of the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF), Piac es Profit (Market and profit) has been communicated.
Six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its admiral role in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 at the 1990 level, irrespective of the success of the signing of the 2012 Agreement, and was ready to reduce them to 30 per cent if the other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also ready to make commitments to their responsibilities and capacities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol had a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members of that period had made an 8 per cent less commitment.
Hungary has undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent over the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the Ministry of the Environment press release.
The issue is great in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy should be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be renewed after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce below the values set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system that has been highlighted in the new IPCC report, the international scientific body, which has obtained the UN Nobel Peace Prize, which is responsible for climate change.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the increase in average Earth temperature of more than 2 degrees of cell could no longer be avoided, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army Recruited on YouTube
British Army units report on the video-sharing site of their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with a view to becoming popular.
First of all, it is the British Air Force (RAF) that has been passionate about YouTube: the special units involved in Afghanistan are charging video sequences on Taliban operations since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken with the help of miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled in the general area of air force operations in Kandahar and are then transferred to London or compatriots to charge them on the Internet.
The political message is irreversible
Air Force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net through this route and their "chain" has been seen by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Defence Department registered as "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 and provides videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were passed online to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to publicize the real goals of the presence of the army abroad.
The propaganda published by this route costs virtually nothing in relation to the usual television recruitment ads, as reported to BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a consultant in defence, and, on the other hand, it also inevitably brings a political message because it is in a special form justifying the well-founded military operations decided by the government.
The Americans have made a game
The army is embroiled because, apart from the videos composed and carefully censured, amateur videos are passed on the sharing site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, officers do not avoid talking about the loss, but they never present the bloody side of the battle.
In addition, many videos have already been posted on the network presenting the operational areas in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out in real mission, but the British army has only recently packed for the loading of these videos.
The Americans do the recruitment a little differently by using the American's Army shooting game for free. In this game, the player can put himself directly in the position of soldiers within a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombola and bignettes in the departments
Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not appear to be sentimental: instead of Christmas, she will hold an end-of-year meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by taking baths and coffee.
Another department will organize a festival with live music, another will enchant the officials with a tombola and offer a glass to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Feast, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffets, so the power was fun.
The public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but these are not the employees of the department who will be invited to attend.
In Noël, Orphelins, the children of the soldiers who have fallen will receive gifts, for the Missionary Christmas, the family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The Department provides for a budget of 25 million forts to create the end-of-year environment.
Compared with other departments, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM festival will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forensics and, over six hundred large employees, three hundred and fifty are expected.
At this festival, the Christmas atmosphere will be harsh, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forts and was organized in the National Justice Council (ILO) building on Wednesday with concerts and dinner.
The rental of the room cost one million forens, the rest was spent for more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, an NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party, which is organised with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a company manager of calls for tenders.
The building of the Theatre of the Gaíté has been rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to contact the responsible person.
The custom is not mandatory
The ILO building not only welcomed the NFÜ but also hosted the Ministry of Justice and Police, who, instead of a Christmas party, organized a ball at the occasion of Saint Luca on 7 December.
ILO did not make them pay for the use of its rooms.
The ball had five hundred people.
The festival began with the Minister's welcome words and dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: the evening party was not absolutely mandatory for this ball.
Departments of Health, Labour and Local Communities are preparing a party.
The Department of Health will organize a show and party to its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite his collaborators to a Christmas party but to an end-of-year working meeting.
One hundred and twenty people are expected to be invited to take a coffee and eat snacks, the press service announced, the festival will not cost as well as 350,000 forts.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Communities, will simply invite his collaborators to take a glass in the hall of the Ministry of Local Communities and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its large hall to which 436 employees are expected.
It spends 2,500 forens per guest including a buffet and a glass.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas each year in the same way.
No planned holiday environment, the official character is strengthened not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the time of the festival that took place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will hold a reception on January 20th to celebrate the new year, the Christmas festival will not take place.
The reception will be held in the Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Wood, and according to the department's communication, 1,000 per person are calculated for hundreds of guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started by a few words of welcome from the Minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not party at all for Christmas, they informed [origo] of their respective press services.
The Ministry of the Environment's Press Service did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the festival organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the grave mega gather
The League trade unions and the National Association of Workers' Councils will be their strike commission on Friday, which will be responsible for coordinating the indefinite strike on Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Box Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause major disruptions in the traffic, as rail traffic will be stopped almost completely and BKV employees (common transport company) will also strike up to 1 p.m.
The League Trade Unions will know on Friday afternoon the details of their strike on Monday, organized with the National Association of Workers Councils.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be formed, it will serve as coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and from Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, starting on the day of the vote in Parliament on the Health Fund Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Fund Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the appeal to the strike.
On the other hand, if the law is voted, the commissions of strike will meet and decide as soon as possible.
According to the National Assembly's Monday agenda, the vote on the Health Fund Act is likely to take place late at night, even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, major loops are planned in the traffic: the railways will stop working for an indefinite period and during the morning a part of the joint transport in Budapest and more than half of Volán companies are at risk of being arrested.
At the same time, at different points of the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike call, and the list of them is kept up-to-date on the League website.
Some organizations report making a strike for an indefinite period, while others have reported a temporary retirement.
Until Thursday afternoon, the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Trade Union (VDSZSZZ) have failed to find an agreement on the minimum services, gold, in the approach of Christmas parties, more and more are those taking the train.
According to current communications, Budapest's joint transport will strike the start of service until 1 p.m., Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Energy and Energy Unions of the League will strike four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Teachers' Democratic Union have called for a strike for 2 hours and 2 hours to 8 hours respectively.
The National Association of Doctors will strike throughout the country in alternating, the Health and Social Workers' Union (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will strike a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four claims made by the League requires the Government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculation of retirement to be implemented from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim seeks a guarantee, in respect of retirement before the legal age, which would enable the system to pass on the functions it deserves before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Trade Union (VDSZSZZ), linked to the League Trade Unions, the proposal of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport concerning secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has increased the risk of countries
According to the Risk Analysis Division, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was constituted in August last year, with the support of the Workbik Magyarszágert Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increase, in several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", society notes that, in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the biggest political risk is already that "in the short term, aggressive ethnic confrontations can occur as a result of the worsening of the already existing ethnic tension between the Tzigan and non-Tzigan population of Hungary".
The Research Institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy likely to provoke this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of the Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of the radical and extreme political groups that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Tzigans and the Hungarians."
The problem is getting worse, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are becoming stronger, and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activities of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, in particular as regards the country's confidence in stability and democratic maturity."
They recall that, following a greater publicity given to the reorganisation of the Hungarian radical and extreme right groups since fall 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since summer 2007 and have been known as the "national self-defence association".
"The common treaty of these meetings is that they are defined as a civil organization when they publicly declare the preparation of their adherents to defence missions (disasters, national defence, defence of the order), armed if necessary, to exceed, by mentioning the incapacity of the police, the army, otherwise said of the state," they added.
They noted that everything was in line with the method, which, based on the support of the political society and the parties, sought to deny different political ambitions in a civil context.
The emphasis on the civil character and status of the association therefore serves only to avoid the legal traps of registering these associations in court, but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activities of the Hungarian Guard are a factor that also increases the risk of neighboring relationships.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential risk source and the ultra-nationalist political actors of certain border countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This affects the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased across the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard, for example, is similar to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) in August 2007.
The many troubles of Rome that broke up in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian Guard.
By taking advantage of these events, UNB has decided to form a guard saying that the objective of the organization is "national self-defence".
According to them, over the past 17 years, the Tzigans have "terrorized" Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations on the establishment of their own resistance guard indicates an increase in the risk of ethnic confrontation.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude the Hungarian Roma from responding to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defence, can be read in the Political Capital Risk Warning.
Attila Juhász, Director of Political Capital Research, said at the request of the telegraph agency: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis was published every year and if events occurred that could have an impact on risk change, they informed the public, as in the present case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law precisely defines the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize working days whose number will decrease next year.
The parties are not even in the EU and the United States.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as rest days.
Rest days are often linked to religious festivals or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends, and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, the latter is much more so that the vigilantes can rest quietly.
In addition, in one year, we have in all eleven festivals marked in red.
March 15 is a national celebration, commemorating the 1848 revolution, and October 23 is the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on 1 May is the feast of work, and on 1 and 2 November, we remember members of our family and of our dead friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, at Pentecost and at Christmas.
The days of our state, national or even religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize working days in cases or only one working day before or after the festival marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has been in a special regulation on the days of replacement of the previous days or after the holidays.
The Act extends to all employers and their employees, to officials and to persons working in the public service.
However, it is not worth the service companies, the institutions that are running without interruption and in service, by their vocation, and also the rest of the day.
This year, working days will only be changed around the end of the year: from 24 December, life stops almost throughout the country because according to experience, most people do more hours or take vacations they have saved for these purposes to be able to spend the days between Christmas and the day of the new year at home.
The next year many holidays fall in the middle of the week or at the end of the week, so there will be less changes in the working days than this year.
The calendar will be reorganized for the first time around the work party to allow the employees to stay at their home for four days.
Saturday 25 April will be a working day to have a rest day on Friday 2 May.
Another change is scheduled for 23 October: Saturday, 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the festivals, as from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the new year's day falls on a Wednesday.
Six ugly things that can infuse colleagues terribly
E-mails that we forget to send, loud messages that we never receive, innocent lies that almost get us more: these are things that "beautiful" the everyday of a place of work.
The question is whether we get used to these problems or we face the challenge and we deliberately avoid the ambiguities, causing problems to others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called the marketing service," said one colleague.
Did you miss a date?
He is best sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before you have any painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
You're borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, a desktop tool or the phone and you don't find them anywhere.
Remember when you put the guard on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
You happen to find your style that you thought was lost on your colleague's office?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking if they have reason to be angry with you for doing their best.
Don't get any envelopes, it's in your pocket because it can be confusing that there's no more envelopes and that you need them immediately.
Your colleagues' private life slippers?
There is no good way to stop the forces that spread.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone your information (subpositions) about the privacy of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
You bury the shared information in you and do not discuss it with your colleagues in your absence, even if your colleagues are also present.
Are you saying you're sick for no reason?
When you call the office and you say you're sick because you feel bad or you feel you need some rest that day, think that your work, your urgent business, your final mission must be done by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you won't work or something can happen that would force you to stay at home, don't forget to prevent your boss and your colleagues from getting away from your absence the next day.
Frequent, charging, telephone
You're drowning in your work, but your colleagues get you into it brutally?
You've become a witness to a phone discussion that you'd rather not listen?
Don't bother your colleagues with coldings, blackmails, high-voice discussions (which you lead above their heads), leg beatings, big words or high-voice discontents.
They may disturb even if your colleagues are not involved in a project (edit, design, organization).
You're accusing the others of a mistake?
If your work is not done for the fixed time, you forget to send an important mail or message, don't blame anyone for that!
Don't put it on account of any chaos in the office or your loud colleagues!
Admit it if you've made a mistake and if it's presented any inconveniences to others, fix the mistake!
Ask how you could fix your fault, fix your neglect!
Do you feel too much at your office?
Putting a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they don't fit in the office!
Don't make jogging comfortable even if your function allows it!
Don't be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if you need it by wearing beautiful and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to answer the expectations, you're no longer interested.
We move slowly into the usual mouth of the morning.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm getting up.
The music changes rhythm and the bass comes to accompany the tone all the time, then a female choral comes along as a true jewel.
Mr.2 broadcasts the song Wings of Love from Zagar.
The Hungarian musical life did not hurt us for a long time with a good-quality electronic pop.
Now, it seems that the boxing becomes different if you listen to the new Zagar album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few new interesting productions born of the Hungarian digital background begin to slightly change the overall image and, despite the new mode of the garage rock tearing down the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer came from Pécs and he played himself in the Yonderboi group before he launched on his own path, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, a jazz ally, electronic dancing and pop music, began to become familiar when he was entrusted with the composition of filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The Ferenc Török season).
Early training in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the magazine wan2 quoted their first album in 2002 among the fifty-largest Hungarian-market albums and Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost single creators of the Hungarian trend that would also be competitive in the West.
Zagar and his group undoubtedly became "trendy" but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The group responded as needed, a new and better disc was released.
The album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, recently released, can open new paths for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the past years in Pécs.
It was a line from the old group of Balázs Zságer Pécs.
We are well with the reference to the flight but next to the air music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of the rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with The Puzzle group, showed his talent in these songs at the first of the album in the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real tube for radio, Mr.2 Petõfi, who has been broadcast from the popular music in the morning to the night, began to introduce the tunes of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("underground Divas").
All right, then?
hvg.hu asked questions at Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: is your music a good music for a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term of music aimed at a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
Music itself saying alternative, underground can also be mediocre and made only for sale and thus become commercial.
Now, a good pop song can also be sincere.
The attitude of reception also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Foreign music, especially in the west, has older traditions.
People go to concerts and not only young people in their early 20s but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I'm obviously glad to see that people are getting more and more into our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal but for a precise reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts or mutual influence already works, but it is perceived only in the inevitable changes at the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to respond to the public's expectations, you wouldn't be more interesting.
hvg.hu: Are you counting on following the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and has made a career rather west.
Zs.B.: We do not really follow his path even though sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
Instead, we are team players who have confidence in the musical presence of the other and let us deploy it.
At first, it was very inevitable that our music would be compared to that of Yonderboi because we are several to leave his group and take another path.
hvg.hu: On the palm of Mr.2 Petõfi, Wings of Love occupy the first place.
Many are those who heard the name Zagar for the first time by the way of this song.
With this more popular style have you deliberately opened to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to make a tube to be able to sell the disc.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to absorb the sound orgy and the most difficult themes discussed on the whole disc.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why are they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a choir of the gospel class.
We had the idea to compose this choral of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
In this way the choir was composed of six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, who was then baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a little?
Zs.B.: This piece already existed in an instrumental version for a long time and then when we composed the album, we thought there was something else missing from this song.
The sequence of agreements attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the song the night the girls took later.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me at the time, but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice, she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the disc and at the concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (with the exception of a single Judy Jay), they have no role alone, they sing all together and they don't sing more than music, so music does only accompany their song.
They were behind the scene too.
Do you want to?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we must forget our ego a little, forget who comes from where, who goes, or just let these wings, the wings of love, take us.
I also wanted others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: In fact, no matter what the music creation process was, we had more difficult pieces during the mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I'm playing a piano concert, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for long, and then, little by little, everything was set up as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I already "launched" this disc.
At this moment, they are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The fair trade risks billions because of its inferiority complex
A dissimulative fraud.
Thus, his former employee is the French giant General Society, owned by the Czech bank Komercní banka.
The bank lost about five billion euros because of it.
But instead it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wants to equal his colleagues, and who, in addition, cannot be considered as incapable at all.
Unlike all large bank houses, it has in time recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market.
"He's weak," they let his superiors hear who told him to the police.
However, if the Kerviel deposit reported by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions resulted in a profit of EUR 1.6 billion at the end of last year.
The crisis exceeds the United States
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he says in the deposit.
Last summer, he managed to benefit from the US crisis to win a half-billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February, according to which the mortgages said "sub-prime", given to low-income customers or to those who had encountered in the past the difficulties of reimbursement, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he did well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"After I won my first half-billionaire, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel confides and adds that he has, of course, kept nothing for himself."
In all the questionnaires, he admits that he lied to the reports so as not to be disappointed.
He managed to double his superiors, although the Eurex Stock Exchange began to be interested in his transactions.
Who risks nothing
Did he fear being discovered?
Not at all.
"I thought the simple thing about getting 1.6 billion for the bank was going to satisfy them."
Where did he come from to risk so big?
He only got to his position gradually.
He had started working at the General Society in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trade assistant and in 2005, he became an independent trade with an annual salary of $90,000.
However, he knew he would never win as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university course and my professional and personal course," Kerviel said.
But shortly after his entry into service, he won his first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won a half-billion euros by putting this title down in London's attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you alone.
"It was like a snowball effect," he told the police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather they doubted it.
"As long as I won, they seemed to close their eyes."
Now, it's when the start of the year comes.
He loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announces that it has lost EUR 5 billion because of it.
And how did we find him?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took 4 days of leave.
A dealer who doesn't take vacations is a dealer who doesn't want to leave his book to someone else," Kerviel concludes.
Czech Republic to get 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech government ministers signed in all nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could in the coming years bring EUR 14 billion (about 365 billion of Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
The Czech companies will be able to obtain approximately 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Rep. can obtain in the framework of these projects.
This will result in an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage an amount of 90.8 billion crowns next year.
Entrepreneurship and innovation, for SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to obtain financial means to encourage innovation within the company.
Businesses should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new more efficient management methods.
So far, the Czech Republic has been among the new members of the EU's least successful beneficiaries.
The Tribunal confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaragua Court of Appeal confirmed today the 20-year prison sentence for the former president of Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of $100 million (about 1.8 billion crowns).
However, later he was released and was assigned to residence in his farm near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, according to 1997-2002, is again incarcerated or not, according to the AP, is not clear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison officers, or they will either let Germany end his sentence at his house, or he will go to prison again.
4 years ago, the Tribunal proved that Germany regularly moved the government's money to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
It was fictional companies and accounts actually belonged to members of his family and his closest supporters.
A part of this money went to the funds that Germany had created to finance its electoral campaign in 2001.
Budget adopted
That's right.
The State budget was adopted.
In what is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The present year was spent a year thanks to the support of the Czech socialist party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford to refuse it.
Contrary to the debate that preceded the vote of the statement of opposition to the government, this time nothing dramatic.
The House of Deputies has adopted this law without any problem which, although most influential, is usually neglected.
That's a kind of paradox.
Whether you like it or not, each chapter and every article are the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is an integral part of the policy, although it is hidden behind the competition for opposition to government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive media and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
Political men's disputes are much more interested in the opinion than in abstracting figures.
The national budgets of the past socialist governments would suffer from three ills that the current budget is unable to resolve at the same time:
The first is the important part of the bill's mandates, not only by retirements, but also by social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" bringing together the parties ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is a deficit economy, as a result of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the deficit in cities and municipalities.
However, this is not the deficit of the state budget, which is the largest allea.
This is public and relatively under control.
The real delay bomb is the scarcity of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued obligations, over and over again, in order to obtain, apart from money from taxes, taxes and bank loans, new sources of investment.
In the past years, they have managed to repay these debts for the mass sale of shares of distribution systems, including those of energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatisations.
Today, they no longer have this source.
If only official and verifiable facts are kept, it is found that:
Our economy has been going through for several years, like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD is not missing to sell.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
But instead, they accused the State more and more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls mainly on previous governments.
We are part of countries that are at the global level at least threatened by poverty.
So we have no need for massive social programs that have, just in recent years, unfortunately unfavourably affected.
Although some of the absurd populist expenditures, approved last year before the elections, have been able to eliminate, if a drop in the age limit for retirement, as well as a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and whoever is in power will only administer it.
By exaggerating, it can be said that political men in power will become bureaucrats that mechanically distribute the majority of money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that makes ordinary costs responsible by the cost of mandates.
The budget deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely useless if the previous governments had not spent all the money they could.
If we really do not want it to happen that policies in power become simple bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the State can only spend the equivalent of what it can collect in taxes and tax rights, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
There are only those who will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than a hundred billion dollars will be placed on monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through a auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Federation will send $40 billion to auctions and will also provide €24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided to take action at this concerted point to prevent or reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major economic problems, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl in his report to the economic advice company Outlook Group.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 per cent to about 50 per cent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unrefunded loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still waiting for other billions of losses.
"If the central banks have chosen this approach, they must really understand what can still be done," says the economist head of ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central Banks are afraid that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend their customers more expensive.
This would reduce consumption and drown the US economy in a recession that can influence the economic growth of the world.
The Central Banks made this choice after they failed to reduce the interbank rate of London, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were always afraid of mutual loans, even though the US, Canadian and English central banks had reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a new decrease in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks approach will not contribute to conjure up the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
President Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is considered to be particularly harmful to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke on the issue of global warming.
This time, the criticism was addressed at the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, which consists of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric accompanying it and the reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it's just a bunch of words, replacing solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, at the presentation of his book, that his subject was of great importance to him and that is why he is committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction with what his book also looked like in German translation, since he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions".
Now interested persons can read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus reminded us that although he is not a climatologist, he does, in his opinion, have enough provisions to write such a book.
It is indeed an academic capable of following and appreciating scientific treaties, it has the practice of statistics and it is also economical.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following: the changing climate, the changes in it are normal, there is no opinion shared by all researchers on global warming, the effects of the current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they therefore represent no danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence the evolution of the climate are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
As far as the experience of a totalitarian regime is concerned, it is unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which it feels as a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to the questions of the people present, he explained on several occasions that it was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integrated environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and their benefits".
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago at Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people have failed to renew their driving license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their former driving license, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day on which people can still ask for renewal, so that the authorities are able to grant them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid permits will borrow the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their license to drive, especially those who no longer wish to drive.
While the municipalities report a fall in the number of applications for renewal of the licence, the authorities in the capital are invading applications and the number of applications for renewal of the licence has increased this week.
The Mairie is satisfied with about 2,000 customers per day.
There's a tail about half an hour away.
In Prague, nearly 140 OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving license.
The release of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request delivery within a five-day short period.
In this case, the driver pays an extra five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who will not be able to carry out the mandatory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and will borrow the road without a valid permit will risk a fine from January.
The guilty will be forced to pay up to two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence by using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine shall amount to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, it was possible for a fine even to be imposed on a person who was not going to circulate.
This could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Department had called upon the authorities to impose fines not exceeding 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one is at risk of fines in tens of thousands.
The driving licence is, according to him, a document that people can decide whether or not they want it.
It's not like with the ID card that, she must be valid without exceptions.
Persons who no longer wish to drive should be allowed to drive.
It is sufficient to bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also obliged to gradually renew other types of driving licence.
Persons with documents from 1994 to 2000 are still three years old for renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the penalties for detectives who are in agreement with Berdých
Josef Opava and Petr Konňarík, former police officers accused of coven with David Berdych's gang, will be held for thirteen and ten years respectively.
The Supreme Court of Prague thus finally sentenced them by reducing their sentences of 1 year and 2 years respectively.
Originally, the Department's detectives for the fight against organized crime were sentenced to 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment delivered today, and only one appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is waiting for the verdict of the first instance.
However, he has already been sentenced to 16 years in other trials.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Departmental Tribunal found guilty of holding 19 persons, and today the Supreme Court dealt with 16 appeals.
Most of the accused referred to the charge in question since the beginning of the investigation, claiming that it was a manipulative case.
According to the Central Bohème Court of Justice, police members, after an agreement with Berdých, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-up and helped gang members to avoid criminal accountability.
The gang sent 30 percent of the larcin back to Opava and Konňarík.
The charge raises the issue of gang crime in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially, armed-armed flights, which in most cases have suffered a serious health attack, but also the abuse of the power of a public agent and the prohibition of weapons.
In the case of domestic searches, the police have, in fact, discovered illegally detained pistols, obstetrics with a steel core, a viewer for direct laser shooting or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang was filled with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from about twenty men in this trial, the courts have already found guilty of other bare-handed flights of Berdych and a whole series of others.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining themselves before the court in another case, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing has, for the time being, prevented Tomáš Póta and Maroš Šulj who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision on their extradition in the Czech Republic.
Children's substitution price: 12 million
Igor Veleba's family lawyer wants to get compensation from Trebíč's hospital for 12 million crowns more spending.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer at the hospital Ondřej Dostál is absolutely not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a claim, which is very high," said Dostál at the hearing.
"To be able to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report the opposite party ordered.
We're going to check if this one has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostál said.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablonów's family demanded a million crowns for each month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a document supporting the negotiations on compensation.
According to psychologists and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different levels and depths.
The stress situation has been better sustained by men, although they have been confronted with remorse that they have not been able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, they are less likely to face the life of trauma in the present and what is happening right now, has summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the hospital in Trebíč on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at Čermák in Primbyslavie and Veronika at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jablonjov.
The governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil region has, at the end of October, handed to each of the families 100,000 crowns for reimbursement of the expenses incurred by the mistake of the Trebíč hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are subject to the law on insurance in civil liability.
In the event of a failure, they must be placed in the back of the reserve, exceptionally, they may ask for the manager's help.
So far, the courts have recognized relatively low damages, the amounts calculated according to the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, with the exception of millions.
Foliage and loss of the Kingdom of Valaško (le Regiment de Valaško)
Bolek Polívka and lost le lidige augument de la marque Valašké kingdom (Royaume de Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, he had actually used the title King of Valaško for the first time, but the project was launched by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, a former collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
Now, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are paralysing about the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, the words of the Kingdom of Valaško refer to this actor and comedian to everyone.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"There's a work behind us for almost ten years.
Looking for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project had success and that they could benefit from it.
They're the ones who want to stay on our job," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who first used the title Valašký kral (King of Valaško) in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, this did not relate to the project of establishing a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of showing the passports of Valašké Královovj.
From a humorous action originally it came out of a profitable business and commercial activity, followed by the creation by Harabiš, from Valašké kralovjt.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that his name and signature were quoted in the passport and even proposed to the holders of the money at the price of visiting his farm and his theatre shows.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš has made use of the nude idea, published by Polívka in the manedž show, for commercial purposes only.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka has certainly helped the Valašký kingdom project," the judge said.
It added, however, that the soul of the project was made up of Harabiš and his team that would be devoted to the project intensively.
The cooperation between the enemies today continued until 2000 when Harabiš organised an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated with the deposition "of King Boleslav 1 elected forever".
The role of leader in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, taken by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, claiming that the court has today rejected.
What could make the case clear is the tournament planned for the throne and half of the princess.
He's supposed to be a new king.
He didn't want to betray details and date yet.
"We don't want to go fast into trouble.
It would be something like the parade of kings in Slovakia.
The king would be elected for a time.
Even Mr. Polívka can of course sign up," Harabiš added.
Test of Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: loss of prejudices
In fact, I've never been a big fan of Peugeot 206.
Its rolling quality was nothing exceptional, the quality of the change in speed, conduct and also that of the manufacturing could, in many respects, be classified below the average.
Now, there is currently on the market his successor Peugeot 207 who, she, is much better.
As far as the SW combo goes a little further, I just need to think more about it.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207, for example, I complained about the space for the head on the rear seats.
When you end up complaining because the combi bodywork means that even the great devils will be at ease in this regard.
Let's see if we can make it quick.
I'm going to call the inside very quickly so I don't get too repeated.
It's a design that's almost successful, my only comment on the central tunnel that seems to me to be poor.
There, I would have liked a design a little more inventive, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when we could complain about seats or too short files is revolutionized.
The lateral guidance also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in body size is also noticeable here.
The combo also sees the lack of space above the above-mentioned head.
A case in the case
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage support.
I need to assess this as very accessible (also thanks to the rear-wheeling ice) and a rather easy lifting.
Blind spaces are equipped with arrest elastics that constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not covered and can be extended while being able to hold rather heavy objects.
But let's stop the volume.
This is done, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather average figure compared to competition.
Apart from Škoda Fabia Combi, the most sold vehicle of this category in Czech Republic.
If the 207 SW is compared to the new generation of the product of Mlada Boleslav, it is found that Peugeot remains very sensitive behind, the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to going abroad on leave or on duty, this figure is almost critical.
But if I were to highlight the benefits, I would mention the seat underside that remains after the back seat files have been returned perfectly straight, or a very low treadmill.
120 horses divided into four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And in fact, that's what should look like a 1.6 that makes a family hatchback walk.
He is silent, consumes little and, above all, pushes well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by Škoda that often gives the impression that there is a pot of escape closed by a snake, then I can only be enthusiastic.
Let's look at the prices.
The price of the vehicle is not accessible to all.
However, we must be aware that a well equipped car has been tested, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with a Otto 1.4 litre engine up to 329 900 Kč is still passable.
The vehicle we tested cost from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80,000 Kč.
Now, we have additional head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic ice-suppression, automatic rear window control...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of the account 531,900 Kč.
This is a lot, but try to add the additional equipment to the price of the Fabia and you will get a very similar number.
So it's only left to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak students into British schools is wrong
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is going to increase, causing the remaining concerns about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is now a series of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the natives are transformed into violence.
The case of the North Kent, where the remaining and immigrants of Slovak origin are beginning to accentuate the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes between the students, the chicane and the baccarats have been brought into the relationship between the parents.
The situation went so far as the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who was hitting a ten-year-old trainee with a iron bar.
The guilty defend himself by claiming that the boy insulted him with racist words.
The police also had to intervene as a result of the attack on a Slovak immigrant led by two adolescents.
The young girls had allegedly addressed this man with racist remarks and had thrown him out of the stones.
"When we returned home, a young man grabbed on the bus stop and began to crack on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered by apples and pears and then discovered his feces," another unpleasant adventure described a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the survivors went to qualify for the conflict with immigrants in the struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between the natives and immigrants is beginning to decline.
70 thousand Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect for your leave can happen if you make the right choice.
Golden and white beaches such as snow, high waves or then a calm sea such as a pond.
Palms and everything included with servers offering you a pizza, ice or a lot of invigorating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but rich.
Now, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
By the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the base of their invasion of the Americas.
Christophe Colomb qualified it as the most beautiful place that the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the deposit and place of transfer of treasures that the Spanish had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was erected in the early 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who built it, because everything that was a crime in the United States (especially under ban) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among its clients, there were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-height buildings moved and cars, belonging to the iconic symbols of the 50's of the last century, circled over the large boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and, in Coîmar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the business show and the political men of the entire America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
At the hotel bar at the National Hotel, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed with the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars are still circulating in Havana, as the jigsaws and the jads imported have long been able in a climate so salty and wet.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly depreciated, nowhere else in the surroundings there are so many splendid colonial monuments that there is just there.
Other places become more beautiful, such as Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has green light.
Over the last 15 years, new hotels have not only moved to Havana, but especially to Varader, on the coast of the Holguín province, as well as on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be particularly appreciated by small train lovers.
The cane was back from the plantations in the sugarcane on a narrow path by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling equipment has not been renewed for decades and this is so that small locomotives, whose contemporarys are not only in museums, can be seen.
Where's the manager?
Most visitors do not lack the most famous places.
So there's no need to write long on Varadero or on Havana.
Otherwise, remember that in Hemingway's property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the person who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Vinales Valley on the west side of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque corners.
An exuberant vegetation pushes it on a limestone floor.
Mogots, limestone balloons and rocks go up to the bottom of the valley, and, since fertile soil has been caught in their trenches, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense plant carpet.
The valley is the place where Cuban tobacco is probably grown of the best quality.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of Havana’s cigarette factories.
Someone might also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was turned.
Trinidad
Old town founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
It is the market of slave trade and that of sugar that brought him glory and wealth.
The wealth has become incarnate in the beauty and character of this small city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by later French settlers, has almost changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the massive mountain Escambray, is a place as far away as in the last 50's, there was no road that would link this region to the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay on the side.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything anymore, everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If one has more time than one afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth going to see interesting places around, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música, which wakes up after the sunset and where the music takes place only in the morning.
Baracoa
Some designate this bourgeoisie located in the extreme east of Cuba as the most beautiful island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the way it leads.
The two roads from Guantanamo have to cross high and uninhabited mountains and cross a landscape with almost no marks of human activity.
UNESCO has entered the eastern coast of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the list of world heritage.
There is the best chocolate in the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in fact, she has seen the day almost a hundred years after the pollution of Colomb) and since the hill where the old chateau-fort and the current El Castillo hotel is held, there are several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
With regard to coffee, rhum, cigars, mountain mass Sierra Maestra, the Bay of the Trues and the Island of Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practiced by descendants of the former slaves, a number of pages could be filled.
Only, as we say correctly, it's better to see it once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, American claims
The lack of necessary soldiers and equipment affects, according to the United States, the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should come up with a concrete plan for the years to come.
The mission in Afghanistan does not take place as it should, the representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country have agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland.
Alongside the growing challenge on the part of the Taliban movement, the eight States involved are today also discussing future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States called NATO troops for greater activity through the defence minister Robert Gates this week, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the Afghan government's authority and the strengthening of development aid.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is discernible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC chain.
Four-twenty-tenths per cent.
The activities of Afghan insurgents are, according to the U.S. military data, the most intense in the past five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, up to 60 per cent in the Helmand province, located in the south of the country.
NATO countries have approximately 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of which nearly one quarter in the south.
However, according to the United States, allies have reached their absolute limit both in the organization and in the equipment of the troops.
In particular, they ask other helicopters, soldiers and experts for training Afghan troops.
"We need to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the future period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop has today held similar talks.
"I am not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have nearly 40 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is not enough," De Hoop said to the Reuters agency at the end of the talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo, which would last three days.
Passive
In recent months, the conflict between countries involved in the issue also prevails if all allies effectively do all they can in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the fighting requirements they are subject to are not as strict as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
The British Sun tabloid qualified German soldiers as peers this week.
"The Afghans discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document completed by German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild passed on to the counterattack by publishing a photo of a British team during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt will rise to a billion in 2009
The burden of a debt of the State exceeding 84,000 crowns falls on each Czech Republic.
The total debt is raised at 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
As a result of a change in the economy of the better state budget, the department has reduced the planned amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic is raised by the end of September at 842.7 billion crowns.
During the nine months of this year it therefore increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
But since June, it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has thus confirmed its debt data from the State beginning in October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns rests on each Czech.
Over the last year, the State has invested more than 111 billion crowns.
"For the moment, it appears that, thanks to a less significant deficit planned for the next year, the limit of a billion crowns could be exceeded only in 2009.
Next year, debt should be between 900 billion and a billion crowns," said Patria Finance David Marek analyst for the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast of Next Finance Vladimir Pikor's analysis is similar: "We could exceed the billion by the year 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If the situation on the political scene seemed to change, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed by 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Debt Increases
The debt of the State is the debt of the central government and is mainly due to the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The State's debt is financed by securities, interest securities, direct loans, or, for example, loans to the European Investment Bank.
The State's domestic debt increased this year from $38.5 billion to $711.4 billion.
The State's external debt increased this year from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The debt of the State called negotiable reached the end of September 803.3 billion crowns and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average debt in the State amounted to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased annually from the first to the third half of 13 per cent, which is, given the good health of the economy, a very high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by interest rates where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be negotiations when the pension reform comes," Pikora said.
Better than what we expected
It is the government's strategy for financing and managing government debt for 2007 to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of September, as a result of a change in the economy of the better state budget, the department reduced the planned amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The amount is essentially the State budget deficit, which is clearly going to reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the 91.3 billion crowns originally planned.
This is then the maximum sources for the Czech Consolidation Agency, i.e. 13.3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state interest rates for 43 billion crowns and the repayment of the European Investment Bank's loans amounting to 1.8 billion crowns.
She compared it to a court in Khartoum today for having named a bear in battle
The British teacher who was tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced on Thursday night by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, reported his lawyer.
The British was accused of leaving students 6-7 years old to name Mahomet to a bear in battle, while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was subject to a punishment of beatings.
This 54-year-old British institute at the University of Khartoum in the Sudan was arrested on Sunday and accused of assaulting Islam and sedentary, under section 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from student parents with the Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to the month of September, when this teacher asks his students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the fighting bear of the class.
"Eight names come out of the mouth of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Mohamed is certainly the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially a very common name in the Sudan.
The children then produced a book for the class with the bear photo followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself had no label with that name, but the problem was simply the representation of the prophet considered to be an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, teaching at the same school in the Sudan, explained that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that might be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name", he said it was only an "innocent mistake".
Notice shared by many students of the institute who describe it as “very attentive to its students” and “who never speaks of religion in class”.
Let us remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second most named in Great Britain, it is written in 14 different ways.
This nickname often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the Prophet (usually given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
Of course, this is an interpretative question.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna.
In the end, I failed.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final discussion session in Baden in Austria on Wednesday morning without overcoming their differences about the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were not able to reach an agreement on the status," European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was "in play", his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence in the immediate but we enter a very difficult period," he added, as it is true that there are "evident tensions".
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika mediators, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will become the last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province with 90% of Albanian phones could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last negotiating session since the troika was commissioned by the United Nations in August.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council from granting independence to Kosovo, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of unusual administration in Kosovo, the West believes that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina is willing to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not vote in favour of it.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreements have been found," announced Kosovo's self-government president Fatmir Sejdiu in the Baden hotel where these "last chance negotiations have been taking place since Monday."
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that the self-government plan presented by Belgrade "was part of a past that led to murders and deportations".
‘Effect domino’
Serbian President Boris Tadic felt for his part that a compromise was always predictable, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
In particular, Belgrade says to reduce a "domino effect" in a region still fragile by the 1990s independent wars.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should be returned to the Security Council only, where its Russian ally had a veto right.
'The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word'
"Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they have begun: the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that "the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the status," adding that any unilateral statement of independence from the Albanian side would be "in consultation" with the Westerns.
Bush draws an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the conference of international peace held on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He explained that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had been heard to engage immediately in negotiations to find a definitive settlement of the happy 60-year-olds among their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must put an end to its colonization activities," Bush said, reminding both parties of their obligations to the "roadmap" for the peace they accepted in 2003.
The Chief of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas "to conclude a peace treaty that resolves all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues".
This appeal covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the gratifying Israeli-Palestinian: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees who fled their homes in what is today the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the US President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be "global and deep" and cover all aspects of a regulation, quoting "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
On his way to the court, Olmert undertook to make future talks "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to lock them up in the course of 2008".
Bush set by the end of 2008 the date of implementation of its "vision of two Palestinian and Israeli States" coexistence.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it had made a commitment in this regard to Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the origin of a plan, which is being implemented by all Arab countries, which offers peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", says Prince Saoud in his interview with the daily Arab phone to Saudi capital.
The prosecutor is not responsible for the police.
What just happened, Sunday?
Like every time in this kind of different fact, official versions and rumors oppose.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the National Police Inspectorate (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., Louise-Michel Street, Villiers-le-Bel.
"It was not in intervention but in patrol, and it was 40-50 km/h, without girophare," explains a police source.
A green motorbike from the Kawazaki brand, "unapproved, therefore not allowed to circulate on the public road" (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circled "very living there".
"She beat the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority to the right," says one police officer.
Alcohol control on the occupants of the vehicle has been shown to be negative.
The condition of the car (before defunct, star-barrel, arrow-barrel) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had commissioned an investigation into the "involuntary homicide and non-injurious assistance" in the IGPN, co-existed with the Department of Public Security of the Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, was derogating from the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday night, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a sort of raining, doubtless caused by the cracking of the track-foots on the ground, showed that the two vehicles were stuck while the police car stopped.
Vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the policemen would have quickly left their seats, thus not providing support to the two young people.
The IGPN, while being cautious, would also avoid “all serious faults” regarding this point.
"It is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more research, which must be very careful about," said a police source.
Liberia met an eye witness of these moments who followed the accident.
One of his windows giving exactly on the scene.
"We immediately went down, with my cousin who is nurse to the hospital, to try to get rid of them, tells this witness.
There was nothing to be done."
He then saw "a completely hagard police officer, who was fighting.
Two others tried to reinvigorate one of the young, the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and it seems to be certain that the people present had the unexpected situation of young people, police officers were taken by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to this witness, reliefs have always come “about 20 minutes after the departure of the police”.
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
"I will not let you say that police services did not assist young people.
These young people have been helped.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
The tension rises in Pakistan
The Pakistani police have repressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who protested the measures taken in the emergency situation were injured by the lacrimogen grenades used by the police, according to witnesses.
The latter responded by throwing stones, hurting policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Cases similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or policemen charged and injured lawyers.
Several would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, lawyers at the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the assembly.
Other events would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyer's movement gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties grouped in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke against the state of emergency and the destruction of those who had sworn in front of Musharraf.
''Musharraf's promise is no longer true''
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly addressed by the exception measure proclaimed Saturday night.
She had to vote in the next few days on the legality of the re-election to President Musharraf on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was avoided and replaced.
'All we have to do is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's judgments,' the magistrate stated in The News.
The promise of Pervez Musharraf to leave the army and become a civilian president 'no longer' after the establishment of the state of emergency, said on Monday the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
Leaving his military uniform was expected by 15 November, the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denounced the country's insistent rumors that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his Deputy Chief of Armed Forces.
More than one third of the girls remain unforeseeable
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) and misplanned or unforeseen births.
Today, more than one pregnancy of three (36%) is not planned, it reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) and misplanned or unforeseen births.
The different methods of contraception such as pill or sterile still present a 5% to 6% failure rate, the Ined estimates.
However, the liberalization of contraception has allowed for better fertility control, according to the Institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births of ten would be well planned today.
See calculated monthly for a couple of five and if possible in the spring, season considered as the most pleasant for having a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will take more than seven hours of work in space at the astronaut Scott Parazynski and his teammates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a damaged solar panel, essential for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky exit that has accumulated memories of its duration, its distance from the living modules, the speed with which it was imagined, of the "brilled" tools by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday, when astronauts had downloaded from Discovery the Harmony Module, a large cylindrical room to welcome soon European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of scoreboard for laboratory modules.
But we need to be able to supply them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a solar panel power generation module of 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, to put it on its final position.
After moving it, the crew started refloating the solar panels of the module, which are 76 metres wide.
And that's where one of the panels, which spread like agreements, was damaged on about a meter by a cable that collapsed.
The deployment was stopped to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who originally had to perform a control release of the Discovery Ship, then to repair another solar panel with the system of rotation, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go to the end of the 30 meters length of the remote arm of the shuttle added to the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (space walker) in NASA.
Large, resistant, very well, it has the very developed torso and long arms.
At 46 years of age, therefore, this training physician was charged with "operating" the solar panel "damaged".
After carefully inspecting the damage, he sectioned the fault cable and installed some of the "atlases" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker who stayed close to the roof and, from within, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey channel wrapped in insulation to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "briculated" by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its tools and returning inside the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts do not return to Discovery for a return to Earth scheduled on Wednesday.
The title of EADS sanctioned in Borse
The EADS action is currently under way at the Paris Stock Exchange, after the Air and Defence Group announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1.2 and 1.4 billion to deal with A400M delays.
EADS lost 4% to EUR 21.96 at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was obliged to review its operational performance forecast for 2007 following delays caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which condition the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost of slowing down the delay in the delivery of its military aircraft, announced in October, is 'between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus',' announced the European manufacturer's mother's house EADS.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be obliged to announce new performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results on Thursday, it will add no further figures.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
The operational result of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspension on Sunday at the exit of the urns: the Russians will opt massively for the part of President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming their aspirations for stability, or for authoritarianism, after a very closed campaign.
At three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a television message on public channels, already registered but the content of which is kept secret.
He does so as the head of the united Russia list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is declared to be a disastrous one.
Yesterday, the President did not let anything of this happen by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting to deliver a new charge against the accused West of interference - his theme of predication during the campaign.
"We know the price of real democracy and we want fair, transparent and open elections," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the account.
It denounces a pressurized campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziuganov says that there has never been "no elections as salt, even at the time of Eltsine".
After the repression of last week's events, the ex-Champion of the failure world Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, remains prohibited from visiting his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mind of the Soviet Homo"
Behind these unscrupulous legislation are two more open issues:
- Who's going to take Putin to the presidency?
The Official Journal published yesterday the date of the first round of the Presidential, March 2, 2008 and the candidates have until December 23rd to be informed.
Election in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot challenge a third consecutive mandate.
There's no successor coming out.
- What role did Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and all-powerful united Russia that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever the case, the legislative and presidential powers are triumphing.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have maintained the mentality of the Soviet Homo, they do not feel master of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kokossov, from St. Petersburg State University, goes further: civil society has been delayed in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine has refused with the model of a paternist state, perfectly accepted by the population as long as this new paternism has not been followed by terror, but by some economic support," says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "refused fully to personal responsibility" which they had briefly demonstrated after the breakup of the USSR.
"What's a good idea?"
The phenomenon touches all social layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (over 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of what the Russians will not vote for the extremists anymore.
The 54 - year - old Professor Tamara Tcherednitchenko concluded: “What good is it to think about?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A Heavy Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which reflect the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are free access.
The 47 million archive documents, stored 27 km from a line in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far only to be consulted for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is to say individually and nominally, at the request of a former victim or his rightholders.
The eleven States in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
Since the ratification process of this agreement has been completed by all States, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for research "in particular on the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and the health status of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, had opposed the opening to the public of these nominations, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some of the deportation victims.
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered after war for a practical purpose: to find the deported civilians or subject to compulsory labour and, where appropriate, to provide them with proof of their detention in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are dealing with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to wait for these documents," said Pr Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Anti-Semitism Research at the Technische Universität de Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, indo-European bilateral trade has already reached almost EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, told the European Commissioner for Commerce Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nat.
The EU Foreign Ministers gave their green light last April to the European Commission to launch negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALEs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
LEU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th EU trading partner, according to the figures of the European Commission.
"A free trade pact works enormously on both economies" and "India would improve its access to a prosperous 450 million European market," Peter Mandelson justified.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, as stated by the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants exchange annually for "EUR 47 billion of goods" and for "EUR 10 billion of services", said Daniele Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has not yet reached its potential. The EU and India are again on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering 10 billion books in five weeks
The Bank of England said it was interesting to ease the current return of credit concerns, and announced an offer of ten billion books at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
"In order to alleviate the concerns that the conditions of the financial market will be particularly closed at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its contribution of reserves during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation", she said in a communiqué.
The Bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12H15 GMT, at the basic rate and until 10 January.
This is the first time the BoE seems to place liquids on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its communication that it "is willing to take other measures to maintain interbank rates" on-line with its basic rate.
The interbank rate per day was 5,829 per cent on Wednesday.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, one higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the amounts placed on the market by the Bank of England have been at an important penalty rate that has deterred the banks from resorting to it.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the course of the book compared to the euro, many have preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank at more favourable rates and with more secure discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused to discuss articles of the proposal for a socialist law on purchasing power, which was equivalent to a rejection of the text.
As part of a socialist "neighbor" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text delineated a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the National Office of the PS, including a 50% increase in the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TIP, a check-in or the rental framework.
The UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), and the meeting was held following the general discussion, which resulted in exchanges, sometimes live, between the majority and opposition to Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS MPs Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the whole of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance bill under consideration by the Assembly next week.
A new festival sees the day
Following many rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the British producer Melvin Benn's Republic Festival.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who has, no less than, inspired the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produced the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival should be held from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Also known as Mean Fiddler, director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the bar of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, then in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177 500 people.
Qualifying the "most inspiring event" that he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn's one working in parallel to give the region a European-style event.
"We chose Philadelphia as a market and worked closely with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We were talking to the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we are trapped in politics because of the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
"Happyly, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we learn to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will last serve the population of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after having moved to the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded their respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals are held in the middle of the city.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a campet festival, while ours are in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The objective is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of the European and American campus festival."
Vineland is almost halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, is enthusiastic about the holding of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but affirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to allow investment in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the reception capacity of this festival is “very large”, like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations were launched to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of the press.
"Vineland will taste rock, but music will vary, hoping to attract all sorts of spectators," said Charlie Jones.
Its partners of C3, who received the Top Independent Award Promote from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film boards in Montréal when no one else opposes Terminator...
This seduction mission is part of the delegation's functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the “Governator” pads?
"Be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best," he said.
The Festival Race
At the moment, however, the priority of Denis Turcotte is to promote the cinema here.
The Oscars race has begun.
It will be from all the festivals of the West Coast, whether that of Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, a question of presenting Quebec films, putting them in mind and ensuring that the directors are interviewing.
The Age of Darkness had a beautiful window at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is at the show in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally in the stock exchange? The experts divided by the crisis of the subprime.
Within five weeks of the end of the fiscal year, investors are already shaking their hands by waiting for the arrival of the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year experts are not as certain as this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in stock exchange generally has positive behaviour.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based solely on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainty about markets, at least in the short term " .
Although they are not partisans in order to ensure that the stock exchange takes place during the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock exchange market is fed by liquidity, willing to invest in the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of escape to quality values both in long periods and in short periods".
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will have rather lateral behaviour, not exempt from volatility "particularly because we do not know the impact of the likely decrease in the Fed's rates, given the high level of gross and the danger of stimulating inflationist tensions"
Javier Barrio, responsible for BPI sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"That's not the best thing," says the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish stock exchange index, has lost almost 4% since 8 November when the index ended at 15.945.7 points.
However, not all experts have this view so negative.
Juan Solana, an analyst for Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension schemes that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuance that things will be a little different this year because he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the celebration of the Constitution (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the trend of the market.
For its part, Federico Olucha, an analyst for Investments Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be generated on the basis of information from the European Union regarding the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex to new maximum costs.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are coming back to him."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some constructors "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
While Federico Olucha, from Inversis Banco, ensures that the increases will be from the bank to the industrial sector.
Constructors will also be able to benefit from this rally, in the case where they are placed.
"The ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert explains.
cyclic consumption will be a leading factor in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do as well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times seven years
During the last seven years, only two times in December was a month of decline.
The genuine end-of-year rally took place in 2003, during which the stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the screening of the technology bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28,17 per cent, the month of December recorded an increase of 6,68 per cent.
It will be necessary to see whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (for the time being Ibex has increased by 8.36 per cent since January) and if it succeeds in computer on its end-year rally.
The Popular Bank will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The People's Bank decided to renew a large part of its offices.
In total 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 p.m., and to open Saturday from 10:00 to 20:30 p.m.
Another group that has also repeated several times that it would like to expand the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about concluding an agreement with the trade unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the People's Bank will be decisive for other organizations to join this initiative that coincides with trading times.
That is exactly what the People's Bank is looking for.
Attract autonomous customers who run in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and trades in the streets they choose to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies all over Spain in about 18 months, as this is not the opening of new agencies but a renewal of existing ones.
To this end, the organization will modernise the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the customer profile of the various streets.
In this way, the expansion of the hours is accompanied by a different design within the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The bank manager, Angel Rivera, ensures that this renewal does not involve large investments, but the recruitment of staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The People's Bank has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as explained by Angel Rivero.
The branches of the Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and the Gran Vía de Madrid streets are the streets that have been chosen, and with apparently success, according to Rivero.
The People's Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others working under the brand of Mundocredit, specializing in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which open even on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We do not want to compete with our customers ', notes Rivero.
For the time being, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with an external staff at the bank.
Telecinco double for the first time the value in Exchange of its rival Antena 3
We're here.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a spokesperson for Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the closing of the stock exchange market, when he found that the chain he led doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect of his joy was that 'what hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have decreased less', he said.
However, he stressed the fact that in a low market, 'we fell less.'
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a 2.54 per cent progression.
This gain has stabilised its loss to 15.66% for one year.
The value of the company's Stock Exchange (with 52% of capital) and announced by Vocento (13% plus) thus reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg's data.
Its rival Antena 3, which has given up 1.52% yesterday and which has accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other communications companies listed in Borse amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the editor of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is because we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, on the same market, at what price and how we can make it profitable in terms of hearing.'
Telecinco announced last week that he planned to become the first television channel this year to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as reported by Giuseppe Tringali, the delegate advisor of Telecinco and Publiespana, the branch that manages the advertising of the group.
In order for this information to be real, the television channel should record an increase of 3.6 per cent in its advertising bill for the current fiscal year compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, the net billing of Antenne 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net television revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco in Borse is the important payout that he has so far maintained: in 2006, Alejandro Echevarría's company distributed 100% of the profits among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
' We have an official commitment to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given some titles with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market currently gives signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profits estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This was due, as they explained, to a decrease in expected growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced Antenne’s profit forecast from 3 to 4,5 % in 2008 and to 7,5 % in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
At the same time as its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of Congress on the amendments incorporated into the project in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulation that would develop the new law, with a view to its entry into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the effort made by Members and senators to negotiate and allow the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of the agencies in order to ensure that markets operate effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Value Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, as it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the Directors of the National Securities Market Commission (NCMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial consulting services for both specialized social reasons and natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (AFI), which combine value companies, value agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of operations on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and internationalization systems, which face competition with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment services undertakings to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and risk management and requires them to keep a record of all their operations in order to facilitate the control of the NCMV.
By passing through the Congress Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, one of which indicates that the debt securities will be considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been shown by what happened with the US high-risk mortgage debt (subpression).
In addition, they benefited from the transposition of the direction, and they benefited from legally delimiting the functions that diplomats in Economics may have 30 years after their approval in 1977, the Royal Decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, which will not require the authorization of the CNMV and which will be able to provide its product marketing services and attract new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The price index for harmonised consumption increases from five tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which is used after Eurostat to incorporate it in the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) policy by providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using various methods of statistical modelling to estimate the information that is not yet available for publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it should not necessarily coincide with the final data to be revealed on the next 14 December.
"The IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said that the increase of 4.1% of the IPC in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has specified in Congress's corridors that "even though the figure is not good" the difference between Spain's inflation in terms of monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than during the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," said the Minister of Economy compared to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros over three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% to 12 000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since it entered crisis in mid-September and had to use an emergency credit with the Bank of England.
At that time, he collected a few records of more than 25,000 million books, a figure that was gradually dropped in two and a half months due to the mistrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government had offered and that it would continue until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would name the organization with her financial trade mark Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenues of the British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain these 18 billion remaining books until the goal of 30,000 million is reached.
The Richard Branson Magnat Group, known for its advertising campaign in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) per year in advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock appointed this week the offer of the Virgin Association, to which three other companies participate, including its preferred to save it from the bank path.
The Mayor of Totana was arrested for a alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard today, early in the morning, arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (the People's Party) because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the municipal council secretaries and the head of the municipal police were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced me last May Juan Morales, current member of the right, and until then the mayor's municipal adviser, who, according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, might be the 'minor' of this plot.
Officers continue to search the municipal premises and the urban council, and new arrests are not missed in the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, chief suspect of the urban corruption plot, discovered at the beginning of this week, was charged.
As the SER chain pointed out yesterday to MP 'popular Party' lawyer Juan Morales, he was arrested from Morales' home with the important documentation in his plot-related possession.
Furthermore, according to the sources of the investigation, the investigation is the alleged encumberment of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of a urban agreement with a building company in Galice to requalify 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight people in custody.
Bono agrees to be the head of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win the elections
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be the head of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the upcoming general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists will win the general elections.
Thus, the Spanish Socialist Party's secretary José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief of the Executive justified the offer made to the former Minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
He also stressed that "yes it seems" that the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the Socialist Group who presides over Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, which announced on 15 November last his decision not to present himself to the next general elections and to abandon his political career to focus on combating climate change in the academic framework.
The former Minister recognized that the President of the Government had not stopped insisting on returning to the political front guard since he abandoned him two years ago.
Moreover, he noted that, although citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, its party wanted to announce the President of Congress in a "transparency act".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or of cry" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems sad that the only place in Madrid where we cannot speak peacefully and peacefully is Congress, the President of the Government of the Senate has been interrupted on some occasions 26 times."
Similarly, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his ability to do" and did not want to do as if he had already occupied his position to not fall, as he had noted, in what his opponents might consider as "a domination".
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to unhindered persecution, both the skepticism of its predictions and those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron consistency.
It is so much more the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or the inaction, of his Government has made a decisive contribution to Spain being the head of the European Union in the non-implementation of Kyoto protocols.
Those responsible for non-execution, in which sectors it has occurred and why its Government, the one with the world contract, has not prevented it.
In addition, he must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures he will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be forced to do, what economic consequences this will bring.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there was no and there will be no explanation.
Just because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costless, uncomfortable and threatening for businesses and individuals' accounts.
Up to one hundred of the essence suggested by the Spanish socialist party seemed to him to be so dangerous in Zapatero that he was forced to deny him.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With phrases that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman is so useful for election campaigns that don't speak, who doesn't speak, who doesn't complain and who doesn't demand, he's embellishing meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is only limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and that it does not claim that we are migrating on bicycles or refreshes us with the range.
The mayor and local police chief of Totana arrested for a alleged plot of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the chief of the local police, the secretary of the Mairie and a suspicious hotel contractor for possible urban crimes, today reported the sources of the investigation.
The City Councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the city hotel, where many officers met, who also presented themselves to the Urban City Council and the municipal management company of the Industrial Sol and Housing.
These three orders are added to the six orders made last Monday in the provinces of Galice, Murcie and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of over 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 dwellings, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislation.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged with the judicial investigation, as instructed by the Court No. 1 of Totalana.
The first six prisoners have now become a court order.
According to sources, the previous municipal councillor of Totana and the current parliamentary autonomous party of the PP, Juan Morales, is the subject of the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, the owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current bailiff of the former municipal councillor, who lives in Murcie.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Immonaur, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the wine pots would have been realized.
The investigation is under the responsibility of the Unit of Urban Crimes of the Central Operative Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie, whose officers, in addition to arrests, have carried out eleven inspections, the majority of the companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcie, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Therefore, one person was arrested in Totana, in total, the owner of a highly known avian product company in the region, which could have played the intermediate role.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 dwellings, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which has been requalified and its project would be to double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomouar, which deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages Vigo parking in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with the comment of yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (some of the PISA information heads above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on 18 November, the same day that he appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the course in Philosophy questioned public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The guilty man, a baccalaureate student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Philosophy Education Adviser, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of daily Helsingin Sanomat and said that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high school."

A colleague passes information on the introduction into the Penal Code of Offences on Internet Downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a criminal offence from six months to one year.
On the other hand, the flight in a CD store for a value of less than EUR 400 is considered only as a mistake (Article 623.1).
B. The flight in a store for a value of up to EUR 1,000 is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for the download (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you fly a car and you pay it 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a luggage than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participating in an intruder involves a penalty of three months per year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and CD trafficking would involve a penalty of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to section 184.2 of the Penal Code.

My doctor has told me about one of his foreign research articles: 'Money produces brain activation, especially if others receive less '.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly wage of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted through tomographic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest science issue.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group responsible for neurocognition images of the Institute of Life&Brain in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed".
The researchers observed that when the two people found that they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if that conclusion required so much science.
The Balkan Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been actively pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years since the Public Department of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will have a bitter taste for it, because the main perpetrators of the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims are dead - former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still free.
Their names are in this list, whose documentary by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach is entitled to the list of Carla ' (2006, not designed exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, who follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade in New York who pursues fugitive criminals and pressures the governments involved to halt the circle.
What kind of insurance is it appropriate for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, involves an important expenditure that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the age of driving licence, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the actual use thereof, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
And it's that, choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay the compensation in case of disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of driving licence, civil status, type of vehicle to be insured or the actual use of the vehicle, among others.
Insurance companies determine their prices according to statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident is high, the higher the rate to be paid is higher.
That is why people over 25 years of age and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower rate of disasters than their caution.
In the same way, using censuses, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing frequency the probability increases.
They are many variables that insurers take into account when establishing the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must carefully examine the situation in order to choose the car insurance that fits the best of his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 must face various inconveniences when passing an insurance contract at an affordable price, as may be the low experience in driving and driving licence age.
Although the ideal for being well assured is a risk-free insurance, there are other more economic options.
The most predictable drivers can opt for a free-at-risk insurance so that they can obtain the cover of an insurance at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of convention implies that the client pays part of the amount of the disaster.
"The part of the loss that the customer will face will be determined according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," says Luis Noguera, the head of Spain of First Europe, Online Insurance Mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the client ensures protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but for those caused by his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against the flight, the fires and the loss of the vehicle.
A tip.
If you are a 25-year-old, try to be careful and avoid the misfortunes as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the insurance price in the future.
A grant is a reduction in the basic tariff that the company has.
On the contrary, sanctions are an increase in the basic tariff.
"Banning and sanctions will depend on the company and on its profit.
If the company has had a good year, it will be able to increase the bonuses," explained Noguera.
Over the last 25 years, it becomes easier for drivers to pass a contract with insurance, as the rate of disasters is reduced by the accumulated experience.
That is why it is preferable to choose insurance with freeness.
" Normally young people cannot benefit from the experience gained after an accident," assures the European company ' s director in Spain and adds that most accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the fear of the news has passed. "
However, if the client is married but has not yet had children, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at any risk, at the time his economic situation allows him to.
Marriages with children are viewed by insurers as persons with the lowest rate of disasters, because the increase will be weaker.
In this case, the best insurance would be a risk-free insurance (may be EUR 300), or a third-party insurance extended from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured person has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more uncoupled conduct and they have a greater purchasing power to allow the luxury to assume a more important amount of franchises," judges Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, a risk-free insurance is preferable (being EUR 150), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of subsidy.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, but also because it represents an important expenditure, that is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that we most agree with our personal situation.
Celtic will seek to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth final
The Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow are measuring next Tuesday in San Siro looking for the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in closing the Champions League, as it serves the Italians to be the first and the Scottishs to classify themselves.
The Italians total ten points and have already qualified during the fifth day with a zero match in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to make sure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass through it.
These two games of Group D will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC will have to dispute the semi-finals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan 13 this month in search of a place by the end of December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the zero match at the Giuseppe Meazza stage seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out victorious, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it will remain first and ensure a better crossing in the eight finals.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team might be enough to rank if Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but it won't only computer on this because with nine points the game comes back to Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1) but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanians would try to poison the night of the Scottish, who hoped to rank for the eighth final for the second time at the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a Kaka goal during the extensions (1-0).
Pending the victory of the 'rosoneri' the triumph would only return to the Shakhtar, if Celtic lost, to rank for the eighth final in order to continue the League of UEFA champions.
And it is that Benfica, although he is last and without the possibility of pursuing European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people assist in Vancouver at the first concert of the Spice Girls tour
The Spice Girls started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group dissolved in 2000.
' Posh Spice ' (Victoria Beckham), ' Scary Spice ' (Melanie Brown), ' Baby Spice ' (Emma Bunton), ' Sporty Spice ' (Melanie Chisholm) and ' Ginger Spice ' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before they started their concert at the GM Place stage in Vancouver that the group meeting was "bright".
Around 20,000 people exhausted the tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video that told the story of the group that raged at the end of 1990.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that resumes their main success as well as two new songs, ' Headlines ' and ' Voodoo ', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls are on stage by showing the bracelets offered by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was in the audience that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days earlier.
Prior to the start of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show".
' Sporty Spice ', which is part of the group in 1998 "because of differences between us" and which caused the group to dissolve two years later, also expressed its nervousness during a press interview, two hours before the show began.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings have changed, the feelings for Spice Girls have changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been arranged and that we appreciate very much".
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl was last shown in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV TV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, a baby army was waiting for them.
They count on her five sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be shown in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will be held in Madrid on 23 December.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine throws the alarm.
A dispute over the price of gas fermentes between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risks of the impact on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (U.E.) are transported by gas pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had led to a decrease in supplies to the U.S. countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurred after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia's gas-supply monopoly company, tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas provided to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase as planned, its prices in Ukraine, as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for gas supplies from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
The analysts said that this would involve Ukraine, an increase of 40% of the import costs from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas passes," said Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh to the Reuters press agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would undoubtedly be linked to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major alteration between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 resulted in the interruption of the supply of Gazprom to Ukraine.
This has led to a drop in exports to Western Europe, resulting in an increase in prices.
The Russian gas represents one quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, even though most of them are still under development.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Ministry of Eco-Health needs to improve controls to be carried out on its extra community employees to check whether they have prior criminal sanctions, the Monitoring Committee said.
The general auditor Robert Black's warning occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern at the fact that the Ministry of Eco-Health had no specific data on the number of overseas personnel employed.
Its report also highlighted other decisive controls, which were properly carried out on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The Auditor-General has carried out checks on extra community personnel following the attack of Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Addullah, a 28-year-old Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after dark with his jeep, in the main terminal doors.
He was one of the three doctors who were filmed in Old Bailey in October, because they were suspected of being involved in various car explosion attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas personnel, to be certain of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Dissolver to carry out previous criminal checks, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor-General's report now states that the committees are required to confront the Office of Criminal Precise Control, thus enabling employers to carry out controls on various countries.
"Although we have found that some staff information has been well verified, this is not always done."
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carried out most of the pre-employment checks it would carry out, but he added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved in order to ensure that adequate information on some of the overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland, stated that it is "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment checks can identify employees who are likely to commit future terrorist acts.
He said, "The report suggests that pre-employment controls currently carried out work well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring any added value."
The Scottish health authorities reported that 1161 people were employed overseas, consisting mostly of doctors and nurses.
However, the Auditor-General stressed that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, in part due to problems relating to the identification of staff with unspecified duration, which could be chosen or not, to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures for the control of health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are perfectly adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Government of Scotland is currently reviewing its pre-employment control policy and system for personnel outside the ocean of the health service.
The Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to carry out this work following the terrorist attack at the airport of Glasgow."
It added that the Government of Scotland, allied to the health committees, would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report that should be published next month, and would undertake to ensure a better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, and valid for all employees, including those from abroad.

Saudi Arabia Block 208 Terrifying Plots
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells carrying out an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on the clergy and the armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the missile smugglers cells.
The supporters of Al Qaeda launched a campaign against the United States monarchy since 2003, following Iraq's invasion.
A cell composed of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, planned an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, reported the TV newspaper.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a 35,000 military group to protect sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaq.
The newspaper quoted a statement by the Minister of the Interior stated that 18 of the arrested persons belonged to a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who entered the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the eight-missile band in the kingdom.
22 persons among the detainees seem to have concurred the murder of ecclesiasticals and armed forces.
The Government has asked the churches to do more against Saudis headed in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and the Islamic Shiite government allied to the United States, considered heretics according to the Sunny Saudi hardline.
Al Qaeda's militants believe that in Saudi Arabia, many ecclesiasticals have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militants, encouraged by appeals against the pro-Western Saudi government, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Major efforts have been made by the armed forces in the last five months..." said the Minister of Interior spokesperson for state television.
Among the detainees, there are 16 members of the Medieval organization in a "mediatic cell" to promote "tafiri thought", the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against unfaithful and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 people are accused of subsidizing the militants.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of Earth.
The scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European orbital vessel have shown that the planet is certainly twice smaller than Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those on Earth, and could even have been inhabited.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiations associated with a slower rotation has led Venus to another kind of evolution.
Today, the planet is deprived of water, destroyed by hurricanes and lightning storms, and has a warm temperature surface enough to ground the lead.
The findings of Venus Express, the European Space Agency's survey, which has studied the planet for one year, offer a sad vision of the potential future of Earth due to catastrophic climate change.
The professor of physics at Oxford University, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We begin to understand the reason why Venus's climate is so different from that of Earth, although the planets in them are practically similar.
"Our new data enables us to establish a scenario that has existed for billions of years, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, could even be with a living surface."
Of uranium enriched by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was kidnapped by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer said that three people had been arrested and that the equipment was currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was good uranium, but revealed that the commodity would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to all
Mitt Romney said not to be high as a candidate for the presidency, to answer the questions of a snow bun man.
Despite this, Republican candidates in the presidency finally agreed to participate in the debate on YouTube, during which many ordinary voters who registered their questions submitted them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, 28 November, none of the questions raised was as ridiculous as the outcome of another debate on YouTube, when a snowblower asked the Democrats for their position in relation to the warming of the planet.
But this time, questions and answers have reflected much the conditions of the Republican party, candidate for the next elections.
It is not known what criteria CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, have chosen the YouTube clips to show applicants.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest of which was one theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for the Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard funny things: The government raised approval increases when the candidates expressed themselves grossly.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is in charge of the important upcoming elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was comfortable with illegal immigration during his mandate as Mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, of using illegal immigrants at his home.
The two combatants became particularly fierce when they were asked whether they would be willing to promote an amnesty (offering illegal status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Young candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to deepen this issue.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both of them remain in the race, can be thanks to the fact that they started fighting immigration before and more incisively than others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same views: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, linked to the concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys manufactured in China, or other fears about the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget, or to minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other subjects were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether putting water in the nose should be considered as torture.
One speaker asked whether the candidates believed in the Bible as a whole.
This led Mr Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not about to believe in the history of Jonas and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
We did not expect to see Mike Huckabee, - in a pole position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - to declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favour, he laughed and said that Jesus was too chic to present himself to the elections.
The human race remains indiscriminately open to all.
Mr. Huckabee's recovery in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious search for grants conducted by liberator Ron Paul, and the siflings during the debate on Wednesday.
These two are out of nowhere, thanks to the fact that both party guards are unable to agree to decide which candidate is the most known and more traditional.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the part of good time and convincingly thanks to a successful message on the American size, thus bringing the leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of the Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which he was falling asleep; even if he had resigned, the situation would not change.
In view of the trend in British scandals, it is not particularly judicious.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel invoices of politicians, no sucquered extra footing.
But here's a revelation that a rich businessman would have masked for four years under false names his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle which Gordon Brown had well happened.
Two months ago, the prime minister walked back in his election project, foolishly insulting the British intelligence, proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant democratic liberal leader, said that the terrorist Mr. Brown had turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The purchase of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty on board the crack, showed a lack of directives and a poor judgment in case of emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative bourde.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against reductions in military expenditures: they proclaimed that being a minister of defence is for them, a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of foolish donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of Workers (and his former Chief of Supervisory) have led them to resign.
Nothing of this means that Mr. Brown is headed unmanufacturedly towards the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and they don't trust them, but generally leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister is unable to improve things, even to govern for a long time, when he is at risk of suspension: the public administration is no longer functioning; the cabinets of ministers are budgeting; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and without any more objective.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repel Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems related to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are linked to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was a chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blair's misery, such a long investigation into the funds of the "counter money for the members of the House of Lords" party could be the opposite.
But the difficult situation Mr. Brown is not as tragic as it seems.
The gaffs are not as monstrous as the members of the Tories party believe.
Like in Mr. Bean, there's no victim or scratch.
And the remedy, although painful, could be to bring about the Stalinist tendencies of Mr Brown always, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special character, who compared his donations to charity, said that he did not want any public recognition of his well-being.
He may have his opinion, but that's not for him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of major policymakers are clear, and they exist for good reason: the public has the right to know what contributes to the success of those who govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said that he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programmes, without knowing that this was illegal, would have to be questioned, as would Jon Mendlesohn, who was responsible for the collection of grants that had spoken of suspicious donations in October.
But until now, Mr. Brown is not involved: nothing makes him think that he has been aware of these practices, even though most of the payments made have been made as a result of his arrival to the government in June.
Until the Prime Minister did half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative failure, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the power of decision is based on a thing he knows well, to resort to a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been breached, it's from the police.
In addition, there are many other things Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent president for the Independent Committee of Public Standards, without leadership for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financing of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, at a time of weakness, to cooperate with the Tories, which could lead it to abandon its special financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a partisan such a Mr. Brown.
But it should deal with some partial facts.
The Conservatives' party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to win the voters, and the only way to win a victory is to demonstrate irreproachable integrity and strong competences.
You scratched cards.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see waiting swimmers, wander around.
Now that the US real estate market passes through a critical phase, the predators aim at the US credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion spreads mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in cost and insolvency rates, which measure the parts of the non-recovery balance sheet or which are more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its credits to the consumer, partly because of the weakness of card holders.
He's just too early to panic.
The costs and insolventities are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% of the third quarter is almost one point compared to its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly due to technical factors.
A change of laws in 2005 in the United States, regarding the personal banking route, caused a sudden fall in the bank route archives, which in turn resulted in heavy losses to credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if the loan conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the monthly debt that consumers need to settle.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is strong enough despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the volume of emissions for 2007 would be 25% higher than last year.
The direct links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debt now that equitable real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the species flow rather than to the value of the property, so the fall in real estate prices did not necessarily lead to a change in the credibility of the borrowers.
They could even benefit credit issuers.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments are falling if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; therefore, credit card debt would become a priority for the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid recovery of the actions.
"We are not going to wake up in the morning and reassess all the loans." said Gary Perlin, Director of Capital One.
If a financial crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a strong risk of a consequent decline.
If the lower real estate prices and a contract in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Take good care of dorsal swimmers..
The British bankers are guilty for the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were supposed to testify to their role in relation to a fraud committed by the former financial director of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, accusing guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were first declared innocent of the seven charges of alleged collusory fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial search to enrich themselves in spite of their employees.
They should appear before the court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all declared guilty of fraud.
The three former members of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, have become famous everywhere in Britain due to extradition procedures that have lasted for two years.
In the United States, their case remains a pending question for this investigation initiated following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges that were brought to them in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that it was the subject of the government's investigation into Enron's debacle.
The charges against the bankers, nicknamed "three of Natwest", were declared to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a branch of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the lead player in many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him to cheat on the banking procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had considered its interest in the branch as zero, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper purchased the interest of the branch bank for £ 1 million.
The bankers paid $250,000 in Kopper as an interest to this company.
According to the charge, Fastow would have falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million in Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the branch.
But in fact, these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, of Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Copper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow complained guilty of his active role in two conspiracys in the end of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow continues a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released as a result of the payment of $1 million each, which forced them to live in the United States during the trial.
Approximately, previously the seventh largest national company, in banking in December 2001, after years of accounting calls, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even propose its bidon speculation as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of redundancies, more than $60 billion of market value loss and more than $2 billion of loss for pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former President General Jeffrey Schilling were sentenced last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Schilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The accusations against Law for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes have been blamed for his death due to a heart attack last year.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream plane, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and having a sufficient fuel autonomy to fly without a scale from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But it's just a little change for some Russians.
"He can transport up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if no one really needs so many seats since it is more than a family-use aircraft or for the president of a society."
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream stand, last Friday, at the Millionaires Hall, a consumer-incentive orgy, for four days, which was held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to stimulate the interest of the new rich Russians for their various products, ranging from yachts in accommodating to diamond-filled cars such as 50 cents.
Mr. Firer was writing a brilliant orange Porsche, exposed next to his stand.
"It is a beautiful car, but nothing comparable to our product" he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
"Thanks to a boom of oil, Russian capital seems to roll in black gold, such as Dallas"
"We lived the same in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a senior member of the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University."
As the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians emerge as the largest global spending.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has $53 billion worth of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich consist of 103,000 million Russians worth $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millions of dollars in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweler.
She participated in the salon for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, The Soho Bijoutier Group.
"Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune."
Walking in the living room, on Sunday night, the two real estate agents posted on their 31st, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 said to be like their clients, millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and tried to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Melle Yumatova, who was wearing her high-quality clothing like a red tape veteran like Joan Rivers.
The salon seems primarily to be aimed at the new rich, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to puke in the mouth to come up to a huge warehouse where they are exposed to the Cadillac Escalades, platinum canifs, Mövenpick ice tables, custom billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and gong bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and the best brands," said Mr. Gijrath, who sits proudly at the Royal factory stand of Dutch porcelain manufacturing Delf, in front of a Raimbrandt wall table on blue tiles, handmade.
"It is certain that the Russians are more interested in bling bling"
In fact, the sellers said here that Russians with old capitals (10-15 years old are too old according to Russian standards) had already passed logos that sparked a limited edition brand that could not be sold in the living room.
In spite of this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaires or tourists, suffer from exposure every day.
And some buy even.
During the first night of the exhibition, on Thursday last, Roman Ershow, the PDG of King Koil's beds, said to have sold two sets of silk, cashmere mattresses, and gold threaded cotton.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycles, a company that teamed cars with last cry alarm systems, also told him that he had sold a millionaire Russian, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalizes luxury cars, said that he would sell three cars similar to bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be engraved with Swarovski crystals to look like a wheel wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants leather wheels made of Augustus, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires," said Mr. Karapetian.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the expression "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the increase in real estate prices here.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you'd already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if it's not cash," he said.
"there is more than you could think"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel that emotion when they go to the Continental Alliance, a Russian heritage management company.
The company raised four stands representing British telephone booths, full of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said that his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Salon.
Passes stopped to launch lots of tickets, asking their friends to photograph them on their mobile, to the very middle of this false wealth or to push a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel a millionaire," said Mr. Karyev.
Non-approved surgeon suspected of murder in New Jersey
It was the watch of Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the glass bay of the restaurant Just a little Healthier and observed an ambulance that just stopped at the gates of the White Cape Code on the West Scott Avenue.
Then the police patrol arrives.
and then another one.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop" said Mr. Livingstone, a restaurant manager, on Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone was dead.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unapproved cosmetic surgeon, that the police have not yet identified, resident in 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Melle Arroyo's death, but they look forward to confident, the results of the toxicological tests, which will take time, but which should allow this mysterious death to be resolved, which has certified the high ranks of the Newark police.
Mille Arroyo was the assistant officer of the police, Garry F. Mc Carty, since September 2006, and his voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tenacity," Mr. McCarthy said about Melle Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday."
"she was like a pit bull"
"She would have done anything to protect me"
Mr. McCarthy said that Melle Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcohol Drinks Control Commission, and that she left two sons 14 and 11 years old, as well as a beautiful daughter.
Eileen Walsj, speaking of the Union County Park, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives were trying to determine whether Melle Arroyo was dead because of an unauthorized surgery.
"This is an opportunity to consider."
"the investigation is ongoing."
The authorities said they had arrived at her place at 3 p.m.
and found Melle arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said very much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Melle Walsh could not confirm whether Melle Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators sought to understand whether a part of the house was used as a medical office.
Wednesday, no one opened the door at Melle Castro's house where a fanny rose rests in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian was lying in the back.
A blue bidon called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for the vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, was placed in a hangar, next to a door leading to the ground.
Two bikes all land on the coasts.
McCarthy said that since his arrival in Newark 25 years ago, in the New York Police Department, Melle Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping him navigate the new city and abandon his framed political culture.
"She said "you must be careful about this" he said.
"She was there when I arrived, and still there when I left.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates associated with the decline in the global stock exchange.
The actions were exploded from the two sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market expected the Federal Reserve to try to calm the credit conditions, subsequently reducing the interest rates promoted by the peace-keeping statements of the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets explode in London, New York and all over Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, stated that those who decide should be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the affected financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure the irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence has in part "inverted some improvements in the functioning of the end-September and October market.
If this was to persist, this would increase the likelihood of further rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear indication that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into American markets, and that further decreases in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also allowed Wall Street to calm down with even worse news on the American economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for the month of October.
The impact of this financial turmoil was accentuated following the statement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it would license 650 people, that is, 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate for the heavy losses caused by the loss of real estate loans.
20 posts are provided only in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2.55%, reaching 13.289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, increased by 2.65%.
In London, FTSE 100 received 165.5 points, or 2.7 per cent, reaching 6306.2 adding more than $39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the reopening of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted by the strong demand for three-month auctions by the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to monitor the EDF and the ECB and to inject other funds into the London financial markets causing credit tensions led to the three-monthly "Libor" lending rates of the British banks, resulting in their higher growth since September, at 6.59% following a strong rise since November 12.
England faces an appeal for judgment against the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are facing two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the number6 drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as wide as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the voters, who was here exceptionally to assist Peter Moore, the chief coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to make his decision, and because Hugh Morris' office, the president of the Director-General of England, began to fill out the application forms to become a national selector, at least in part.
The one who won't be able to win file number 6 will be miserable, but life is often unfair and sport is also.
It is never easy to ignore what allows a man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach the lower level, sometimes by lack of luck more than by lack of ability.
There is only a cricket that selection is difficult, because ultimately the judgment remains subjective.
Is it a good time to get Bopara out?
Is that right about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which would choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both new managers who have obtained good diplomas, professional, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the level of a cricketer unless he is given at least one chance?
The figures are important in decisions, but also opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be able to touch the cricketer one day.
But catching the eyes of the voters is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson, who seemed to play the first test, even though Stephen Harmison was in full shape and continued to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 tours to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both had already lived their time of glory at the highest level and hoped to offer again.
If it's Shah or Bopara who plays at Asgiriya Stadium, it's just a matter of opinion.
This choice could go ahead or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and successfully in the first, with five doors and 40 useful tours, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also struggled to emerge, who succeeded in becoming the main critic of the test, and despite the fact that his double-cent mark against Australia in Australia could still be estimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start at the innings of the Test from 88 to Bombay, 32 cents of the first class against six for Bopara, who at 22 years of age is seven younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah made only ten rounds during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test in Lord, his Middlesex player city, and that, immediately rejected by the voters when Vaughan again in form, claimed his place for the next match, seemed to have hit his elans so obvious in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy to live.
Nothing made him afraid of a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently captivated a 4x4 at a presentation by Volkswagen, England's sponsor.
He reported only slight injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor well on) and call Alastair Cook, his team looking at him from a distance, to ask him if he had seen this.
Bopara is the best drummer from far away, his threading allure allows him to do services that go to him, and he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Could it be the true art of the selection?
I would prefer to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if such tea leaves suggest he will be the one who will play this weekend.
Buses bring people to work, and fight against al Qaeda.
The first full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, throwing these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others hoping that the city would have found normal.
Some have come to fight the militants who have driven them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported to dozens of official government bus convoys, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who were returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because I saw the TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and because the city is more sure now."
"They say the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!" he said, referring to the militia of the Moqtada al-Sadr ecclesiastical militant, who forced his men to leave for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Amariyah area dominated by Sunni, returned with his two children, because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called on him to inform him that the United States-assisted militia had driven Al Qaeda west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of the new arrivals in Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad due to an attack on the grenade after urging citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm coming in today," said 62-year-old Sabah Alu Obeidi.
Many say that they have been attracted by the increasing acclamation of the capital since the US troops arrived, and for the continued training of well-armed "citizen groups" and collaborating with American soldiers to defend their neighbours.
But others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled over the past years.
Salaam al-Samarai, 51 years old, father of three children, expressed the suspicion of all about visas for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, would have asked the Syrian government to limit it to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people would have fled the country because of the sectarian death squadrons.
"We had no problem until al-Maliki arrived in Syria and encouraged the government to give no more visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," Sunni said.
"I cannot trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house when I left."
The decrease in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis have been chased out of Shia and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
It is feared that a sudden flow of refugees does not increase the sectarian tensions again and bring fights back.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federal state conducts vocational training, and even shines through the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a no Sarrois, that we are not French" - it is the slogan that the smallest federal state, by itself, shows for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of the Sarre, which is the fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics of Cologne.
Thus, by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
So far, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double, or a triple degree.
This shows the high ratio of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Sarre also leads the children of the country to higher education in many higher educations than on average - many of them without a diploma from the Gymnasium.
"In Sarre, we benefit from the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, an IW training expert.
More than one out of five young people get their degree in a vocational school, so Sarre is located at more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are also relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the dual course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has decreased by one third in recent years.
That's why the Ministry of Sarrow Education has forced higher schools to a marketing campaign in the field of engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," says a spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparison tests in all federal states.
In order for children to begin to learn early, the last harvest year is free of law - a model that is also used in the meantime by other federal states.
Only future comparative studies will be able to demonstrate whether students' performance is improved in a sustainable way.
In PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of students at risk decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, Sarre has not improved as much as other federal states have.
The Bavarians are getting better off.
And in spite of the sarrhoea, knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - one could gain points in this field.
Because the neighbor's language is mandatory in the high schools - even if the sarrois are not French.
Ruler of the Watches
In Venezuela, the watches will soon be ticking other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will set up a half-hour time in the South American country.
Chavez becomes a caricature in Spain in the meantime.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated it, because of a new law, watches will be regulated at least four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position among others by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighboring country, Colombia, due to a case of hostages.
The left nationalist announced that as long as the Conservative Alvaro Uribe remained President of Colombia, he would not have relations with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I can't, but only because of my dignity," Chavez said, who has a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by Sunday's referendum.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The triggering element of this dispute was the decision of Uribe to withdraw from Chávez the mandate of negotiations on the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "cracked the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Chavez Sunday.
In Spain Chavez is also in all mouths.
A new voice of mobile phone rages in the country: "Why don't you call" is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the Internet.
It was pronounced by the king of Spain Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was angry with the constant impalements of left populists and who told him to laugh.
A reduction in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economy, according to a forecast, a true less-value of wages threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons to explain their prognostic pessimist.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect a real reduction in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"Failure is due to low wage development, to an increase in the value added tax and to increases in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macro-Economy and Economic Research, in the "Build" newspaper.
New charges could also be involved in unemployment insurance for the employee.
The finance minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the expected fall in unemployment insurance of 3.3 per cent for the new year was certain and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be in the process of asking the Federation for funds or financial assistance, according to the words of the SPD politician.
It was known on Tuesday that the explosion of food prices and hydrocarbons has increased the inflation rate to its highest level for 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 per cent per year to each other.
Comes is the infernal base of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus is more like Earth than what we have believed so far: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lights in the atmosphere and wind turbines to the poles, similar to those appearing in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there is light on Venus.
The European "Venus Express" probe today has given evidence - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lights on Venus sparkle at an altitude of about 56 kilometres of clouds in clouds, report Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of cyprine, the lights would have revealed life on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If there was life there must have been a very old date of history," says Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
Today there should not be much living things on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
"It may be the infernal twin of the Earth, but it remains a twin," Russel said.
Why has Venus, which is so much like the Earth in mass and dimensions, been hit with a different evolution, is the fundamental issue of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venezuelan research, as no more probes have been on the way to exploring this planet since the four-to-ten years.
According to researchers, the most recent research findings that have now been presented in several articles of "Natural" not only highlight Venus uniqueness within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more than expected in the first place.
So the researchers found, in addition to the wind turbines already known in the North Pole, a cloud balloon in the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon reminds air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni de l'Instituto di Astrofisca Spaciale e Fisica Cosmica italien.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometres, almost as large.
The star-qualified planet of the evening or the morning revolves around the sun for just 225 days.
It, however, turns much slower on itself: a Venezianian day lasts 243 land days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly remembers the Earth, scientists assume that the two planets are made up of similar conditions.
On both sides, the water accumulated and remained on Earth as oceans, but lost in space on Venus.
And when carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth as carbonate, it is on Venus most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Köhler, calls for the end of the party's quarrel over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs for attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler takes care of Germany's appearance and sums up the great coalition of chlorine on the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not present a divided nation on this issue to the outside world," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for the differences between cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive foreign policy balance, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the accusations that she would organize a new policy in China.
The German chancellor did not take its distance with the traditional policy of one China.
"China also knows," said Köhler.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his discontent about the reception of Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this purpose outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier complained, in particular, about the "priority policy" of the UCD in foreign policy.
Following the reception of the Dalai Lama in Chancelerie, virulent irritations appeared in German-Chinese reports.
Thus, not only did the Chinese government order German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but Spiegel reportedly also frozen the dialogue on the foreign ministers' strategy of the two countries.
The head of the Chinese government, Wen Jiabao, now demands the German Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that the Dalai Lama reception was a mistake.
China refused to have European political men receive Tibet's spiritual leader in his official functions, thus supporting Wen Jiabao's Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama's words and actions would show that he is trying to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan regions, including other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against emulsions such as those of France.
Street fights with the police, shootings, fire cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
All must be implemented so that social insatisfaction in Germany does not explode in the streets by violence, the German Minister of the Interior has demanded.
The German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is afraid of a similar evolution in Germany after the serious riots of young people in France.
We must ensure that a social explosive is not the same at home and is disbanded in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" in Hanover.
All young people would not be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federal States and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From the summits of integration to the conferences on Islam, this has already shown its first success."
But it would be too soon for an end of alert.
Schäuble points out that at the same time as in German flags, there are no sociological problems or from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people were faced with severe street fights with the police during the last night.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings burned.
More efforts to integrate the German government were required by the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Taking into account the emus in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat points out that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of age from immigration would be higher than the average.
There should be more training places first and foremost.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish communities, however, added that social control in families was more prevalent in Germany than in France.
Many young immigrants do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat called out, "But we still have to be cautious."
Young people should be "invited to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, in the Parisian faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter flew over the area with projectors.
There were three arrests by the post authorities, as well as some burned cars and trash.
Since the conference, a deployment of approximately 1,000 security forces has calmed down.
The police will intervene as long as is necessary, the Minister of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to Faubourg.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 policemen were injured during the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the riots came to Toulouse.
The emu exploded after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Parquet, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the Empire of Angela Merkel.
The Utopian entrance to the chancellor shows that the coalition has ended with the background - and there is nothing more to expect of it.
In what country does this chancellor live?
After his desperate intervention in the general debate of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor of content, it must be said: not here - in the country which should ultimately be governed by it.
The blame for too much focusing on politics was set aside by Angela Merkel in a harsh and presumptive sentence.
It is provincial, she said and only showed by this that she does not want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it made it visible to all the extent to which this complaint was accurate.
There was no particular interest or feeling for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela stood out as a cloud: a tight politician, who was in foreign politics and who remained there for almost a while.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it still welcomes the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate goals should be achieved in our country.
Even the praise of itself - having too little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it two years ago.
Now it adheres to formulas all made, that growth would affect people.
There she destroys her image as a pragmatist, who solves the problems rather than embellishing the world.
But in the empire of the Angela cloud, domestic policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Children's poverty and low-paid workers' concerns?
He's got a few extra phrases left for it.
In this respect, the number of times it makes loopholes when it comes to family allocation is revealed.
Here, Merkel needs three beginnings to pronounce a half-precise sentence.
It titubs in unknown land, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In Youtube's debate of the Republican candidates to the presidency, both Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney's favourites are fighting a hard offensive battle - and now they have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already in the first place.
He would have made New York a "refugee for clandestines," Mitt Romney blames his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
He counters his side with heavy insults: "I would say that his own home was a haven for clandestines" Giuliani replied and blames the former governor of Massachusetts for having employed immigrants without paper.
The candidates go up to the attack: as the Republican base also has no official preference, the eight presidential candidates are used to debate CNN first and foremost to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users sent via Youtube are hardly more than fans.
"It's with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power," John McCain launched his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to claim an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also makes the lesson powerfully by the veterans of Vietnam, when he refuses to condemn as a torture what is called the "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where the noyade is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go between time and time beyond the war in Iraq and the debate on torture is reflected in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Common Hall in Florida.
Whether conservative values are leased or future tax increases are refused, the applause in the auditorium depart.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favourites are revealed once again.
"I made a mistake at this time," explains Romney, contradicts and presents his excuses to the base and television audience for having still been a part of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is in a deep sleep when asked for his opinion on Scriptural interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil.
One day after his withdrawal as the leader of the armed forces, the Pakistani power man Musharraf was invested as president.
That's how eight years of military domination ends.
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has been invested on Thursday for a new five-year term of office.
Pakistani television broadcasts the ceremony live at the presidential palace of the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the welfare of the Nation.
On Wednesday, he had transferred his duties as chief of the armed forces to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus succumbed to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after his taking power through a bloodless pusch, the former general now rules for the first time as head of civil state.
As a result of this withdrawal from the commander's position as chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had met the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency decreed by Musharraf on 3 November.
Shortly after his investment, Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayum, thus fulfilling another West requirement.
The Supreme Court of the country, which had occupied Musharraf after the establishment of the state of emergency with judges of its rank, had rejected all appeals against the controversial reelection of the head of state on 6 October last week.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four other wounded.
According to the military spokesperson, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghanistan border.
Krautrock's fathers are returning them.
The supergroups of Germany in the 1960s replayed: the three members of the Harmonia group again took their console at a concert in Berlin.
For their return, they prepared records of their great success "Live 1974".
By this time, they were much more known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three teachers announced at the evening show.
Each has his little box in front of him, his cable, and first of all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63 years old, sits in the middle of a white shirt like snow.
It is flanked to the left of Michael Rother, 57-year-old and has a portable computer and a guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73 years old, leans on his console.
Each contributes to the noise, including a beat.
And sometimes it adds inadvertently to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group plays again assured some emotions among Krautrock's lovers.
We have the right to disclose it here: Targeted surveys reveal that, of course, the name is reasonable in the collective memory of the pop, but in no case so long as this group has been in pain for 32 years.
But why wouldn't the German also have the right to celebrate its living legends in the 1960s?
More and more, the tricky thing called "Krautrock" has more and more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne Can Group for their work, German pop faces were seen in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in Panegyrian praise, the surprise was no longer limited.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the scene of Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance in itself and the transformation into the unknown is the only one.
The memory is of this fact already taken by Harmony, because the trio existed only two years and that during this period, the impact power that felt was much lower than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We played first in the cellars below the Berlin stage.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had recently landed in Kraftwerk and finally became a guitarist with Neu!, who was then perhaps the most radical German group.
About 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exile in the forests of Weserbergland.
There, in an old Weser farm, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Komune I", where Roedelius had the right to be tortured as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
So-and-so there was in the trash a fan of the Hormonia Ottenstein choral and also a name for art.
Many hold harmony away from that.
The first album is called "Music von Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
Because also serene and modic as music sounded, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvest of the dead wood did not serve him alone in search of himself.
The "Live 1974" CD that has just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griesse in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as well as someone who remembers.
Rother released at that time the desire to force Harmony to practice in time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and assured his existence with such albums as "Flamende Herzen" (in flame hearts).
Cluster reanimates in the four-year-olds and has been more successful than Harmony has ever been.
We have to play the live album of Griesem at Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its label Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as a German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been destroyed on this occasion like Roedelius's personal work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, old punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation margin of the influence of Krautrock would be clear with regard to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be completed by Harmony.
Brian Eno's phrase plans in the room in the middle of the individual sounds: "The only true music, you listen to the future."
There are photos showing producers with Harmony in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white photos of cabled tools in basar serve the formation of legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and battery, to draw the instruments of the new sounds by means of instruments of self-constructed effects.
Today, electronic music is similar to electronic music.
The three in great technical fibers.
That's why the house choir won't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and cough under the sound cloud, and we sing at a beautiful moment "Aaaaaaah" with an emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It's never been rock.
The roots were found less in the blues than in the music conservatories (Can), the Kraftwerk technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who calls "68" is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia is also now no longer getting angry with it.
But what goes most of itself will be covered in a minute on the scene.
Where does music start and where does it end?
It can tap on someone's nerves (?) or give away moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynic enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Peace Killer", two films re-approach the Balkan War.
But they're not convinced.
Both the projects rely too much on action and on the exchange of insinuated shots or on the contrary they are too alarming.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: certain war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is right there, in the most luxurious country of the war in Bosnia, that actor Richard Gere was then found.
In the last place we had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the four-year-olds, because many too nice and dirty roles in women-sensitive films and many too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism pleased him to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at even "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunter (why do today's films have to be as long and confused as collective agreements of drivers of locomotives?)
He gives a magnificent representation full of eyebrows: at the bottom, his character to report war Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the fate and the film industry were not as charitable: a man who has his best moments long ago, but who, even as a monument in ruin to his decline, has preserved the visible remains of his former charm.
But in spite of this attack, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Peace Murder", which is also released this week, the endless follow-up of films missed on the Balkan War.
The trial can be carried out quickly: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb of Kosovar francs, in which one of the two is still in love.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not once presented as the only causes of all the evils, this film is as flat as a film loses too fast in action and insanity.
This remains a sort of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war in place.
On the contrary, we can look at the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why in the bottom there was never a really good movie on the Balkans war.
The story of the three U.S. war reporters, who are conditioned to punish the high-level war criminal "the renard", could have become, with another director and other screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories seem striking: two males go into a small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for the two males, it becomes a journey in madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that one simply does not let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynic with a heart, as it was presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script should attribute him to overcoming a romantic adventure with a Bosniak murdered afterwards.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes ultimately bad when, in the last five minutes, it's a process that has accelerated, that NATO, the CIA and all the world's prize hunters have failed in five years: capture the war criminal and leave him for a fair revenge on the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Hague Criminal Court should be seized against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too much human concern.
He wants to say that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must be exceptionally agreed) not to conduct the hunt in a rather intensive manner because of secret political agreements.
But the intent and evil are so similar this time that a famous poem from Brecht comes to our mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the work table of the poet: "Compathant, I see the veins of the inflamed front, clearly: as it is tiring to be evil."
The films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such wobbly heads, but they imply how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of movies on the Balkans War.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were big flops.
It can be added: there have never been any good films in South Africa.
What's worth every time: when a star draws on a crisis home or on a field of mines, then there's something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseis go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still just too close in time.
Whatever the case, decades have passed before Hollywood can play a good movie on the Holocaust with "The Schindler List".
Some films still have to be wallowed - those that are now worth classic work on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have in no way been celebrated solely at their time as workers' leaders.
But maybe in our knowledge today we're just too much on the world's conflicts, where every hecatombe comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And this gives the writers the lack of scruples they need to tell nice stories.
"Being or not to be" or "The dictator" have become as good as it was because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know to what extent the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe you need the sarcastic artistic look and distance from the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lempirian Dictionnaire" and the Balkans War, he replied, "It only holds that some things never change."
"The great cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in a horrendous way, and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust collects the criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The resignation of the mayor with Hamburg's application for the Summer Olympic Games was a success in the policy and economy of critical virulents.
Many want to keep fighting for the Games on the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the assessment of chances.
The chief director of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a abandonment on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as much motivational forces in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the political and sports elite could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point in the longer term, "who takes as starting point another modified agenda".
Major Ole von Beust remained there on Wednesday to his previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions in Hamburg were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides to apply to the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports," said Von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
He refers to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports in early December, regarding Munich's application for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us, that, in the period of time that we had planned until 2028, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not ultimately belong to the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
The impression would be that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity by burying the projects now," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A resignation of the candidacy would be more in contradiction with the statements made by the head of the Senate at the occasion of the plenary assembly of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg's application to the 2015 Universities as "no substitute" to the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first in the past weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The mayor's SPD fraction blamed the Senate for not using this precious time in building housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Petit Grassbrook was rejected by the Senate for years because he played the map of the Olympics and excluded the construction of housing," SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD has always called for a plan integrated into the Olympics and a later use of housing for the Little Grassbrook, the CDU would only have put on the "Event factor".
The application for the Summer Olympic Games in 2012 would have a great enthusiasm for its part in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg was broken against Leipzig.
These aren't Warhols' boxes.
He who connects Sweden's concepts and falls in wood, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or what if?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on the Warhol works list.
A large part of the four-twenty-ten Brillo-Boxs of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After a few months ago, the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Brillo Boxes in Andy Warhol's 1968, internal research at the Modern Museum of Stockholm today results in a disserting result: the six "Brillo Boxes", whose former director of the Pontus Hulten Museum gave in 1995 at the Modern Museum, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which circulate on the international market of art.
The old history is covered, a decoupling of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, a wooden box based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" powdered soap cartons.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museum was presented in 1968 - with the Warhol agreement - of hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: they did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
This was not about works of art, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wood boxes in Sweden, which were not also exposed to Moderna Museet.
Today, witnesses of the time speak of about fifteen wooden cassettes that would then enter the history of art and auctions, as the original Brillo Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the title "Type Stockholm".
Some of them achieved more than $100,000 in sales.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum claimed, on the contrary, later that about one hundred wooden cassettes had been produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then have given it to him.
In fact, the 105 Hultén caisses were produced in Malmö in 1990 alone, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, head of the Modern Museum, examined, next to the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their stratified panels were first printed and punched, then applied with a paint brush to white oil.
The texture of the copies dating from 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that the painting was directly applied without a background layer on stratified panels, using a painting roll - it is not a painting on the oil, but a acrylic.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol", lets hear the director of the Moderna Museum, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come another decision, the Moderna Museum will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/materials of the exhibition."
Already in July, the Board's Authentication announced that it would investigate the "hard charges" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
But since we've been there for an inexorable silence.
The rebel soldiers of Manila abandon
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers leave, the same ones who had retired in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who reproached the President for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not respond to any blood transfusions.
The faithful soldiers in power had just taken the hotel with the help of lacrimogen gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been retreating for hours in the building.
About half of them were held in court on Wednesday because of an attempt by Putsch in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
It takes advantage of the hearing to unravel suddenly with about 30 sympathians.
The military policemen, who normally had to monitor them, had apparently been devastated in their favor and joined their mutiny.
They entered the hotel in Pennsylvania and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Reliable troops in power buoyed the area around the hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemns the action of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was in charge of the Scouts Rangers elite unit, said that other army units were about to join the march.
The regime ' s criticisms had called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded by corruption for months.
The Manila Finance District was already the theatre of the munition attempt of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection broke almost 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts to push against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has participated more than 20 per cent of Versatel's telecommunications company.
The average price by action is EUR 14.46, as communicated by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the social capital would be held.
We've already speculated on a purchase before.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
This does not seek to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet reported.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the Berenberg bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third party, it is reported on the market.
The watch, United Internet had already acquired a 10% share in the Drillisch mobile phone company.
As part of an increase in capital, Drillisch has put in Borse 17.4 million new shares of a value of EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million for EUR 31.1 million.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile phones.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a spokesperson for the United Internet.
The two companies founded the participating company MSP in order to absorb the Freenet competitor.
For the time being, both companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent participation in Freenet, and do not take advantage of their right to enclosing 18.49 percent additional in Freenet, they trusted the United Internet Thursday.
However, both companies would leave all open options, in particular to increase participation in the Freenet SA, we have learned.
The negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
The still difficult predictable poker on Freenet that has lasted for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million clients linked to a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL clients and full subscriptions.
The Holding of United Internet and Drillisch so far held a direct participation in Freenet of 6.01 per cent.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring about four percent more.
The right to buy 18.49 per cent of the Vatas investment company had already been decided in August.
