The right-wing populist triumph in Austria, together with 29 per cent
Citizen weakenings both sides of today's large coalitions and the significant strengthening of the right populist parties have brought, according to the first preliminary results, the Sunday preliminary parliamentary elections in Austria.
In particular, strong losses have been suffered by the Austrian People's Party (ODP), where the position of President Wilhelm Molter is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, election leader Swazu for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Croatian heitman Jörg Haider is about to return triumphantly to national policy.
According to the preliminary results, social democracy (SPO) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 per cent of the votes against the last 2006 elections, but it loses 5.5 per cent of the votes.
Even worse was the loss of GDP by 25.6 per cent, almost nine per cent of the votes.
These are the worst results of both of these major parties in the Austrian war history, and especially of the peoples who have triggered the early elections, which is a truly disastrous outcome.
Even at the beginning of July, when the OPS came out of the coalition, people had a significant leap ahead of SPÖ.
However, the voters were evidently punished for letting the government waste.
In the first reactions to the results, speculation about the possible resignation of the president of the party and the current Vice-Chairman Wilhelm Molterer has already been reported.
Observers are of the view that this could occur on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the presidency of the Party.
Such a development would probably make the way to the still most likely outcome of the election, i.e. the restoration of the large SPÖ and OEPP coalitions.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - free (FPÖ) had already achieved 18 per cent and 11 per cent of the BZÖ vote - social democrats expressed concern about the repetition of 1999, when the people agreed with the populists (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 the BZÖ withdrew) to the common government, which has even led to sanctions on the part of the European Union.
This development is clearly agreed upon by Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with any party and proposes to return to Vienna for national policy.
The Green Party has yet to reach parliament, but it has lost easily and has fallen among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
None of the other parties apparently exceeded the four-percent threshold and did not reach parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Vztahy with India can cool
If a problem could not be solved with Czech scientists who had been complained about illegal broiling in India, the Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs Karl Schwarzenberg would have found a certain cooling of Czech-India relations.
The minister introduced this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian anti-Mukherdzi Pranábe.
"If this did not work out, then yes, then some cooling would happen," he noted after a meeting that took place from the Czech initiative.
Mukherdzi said after the hearing that in judicial matters the executive might be very difficult to deal with.
However, he stated that in the case of Peter Schváchy, who was acquitted and tortured, the central government can deal with the local government in Darjiling, where the matter falls under jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kucher, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be according to Mukherdzi's best to appeal to the higher court.
Then he could ask for bail and wait for a sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that he also expressed himself to his partner in the discussion.
"He recommends the appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to love him," said the chief of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech party can intervene in the whole of the matter is to provide the convicted "competent legal support", the Indian minister stated.
At the same time, he said that such assistance was already provided by the Indian side.
"We are most interested in maintaining the best relations with India that have a long tradition.
The Indians also acknowledge it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as the CHK said, in front of his partner, he stressed that the Czech Republic is making the problem of Czech entomologists very important.
"We really consider the deep miscarriage and regret of these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister avoided the answer to the question of whether he had made an Indian commitment to deal with the matter.
"I've got quite enough promises already," he said.
Czech judges battle on the seabed
It will come to a walled electronic map that is illustrated by Australia and the adjacent maritime areas.
But he doesn't care about the continent, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it an adjacent seabed.
The area is, however, large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a thirty-year team of UN Division of Oceans and Maritime Law.
His chief, the director of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, attends the lecture and sometimes adds.
He'll rule the work force and the excitement.
The bottom of the sea hides a little known world, rich in natural resources.
There can be oil, ore and other non-growth raw materials, but also unknown living organisms that carry the key to developing cancer medicine.
Lower than hard
The coastal States have now begun to vacate the new sub-sea area.
According to the UN Convention, they exercise their rights, which they agreed in 1982 in Monte Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often stretches up to a hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
It has an exclusive claim under the Convention to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplyly taken, the part of the seabed and its base is a natural continuation of the continent below the sea.
It goes beyond the coast, often even beyond the border of two hundred miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the definition of the external limits of the continental shelf shall be accompanied by a comprehensive scientific documentation based on a number of cost-benefit studies and measurements.
It's the result of a series of years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has so far discussed five requests, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three countries have so far succeeded," Mikulka adds.
The world's announcement has recently seen Australia's success, which, as a first, has significantly expanded its sub-sea countries.
But he also won New Zealand - a sea floor space, which the Commission approved last week, is about 1.6 million square miles, about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The future profit of using the sea floor will be invaluable, as they promise.
It shall submit its requests gradually to the other States.
They can do this up to ten years from the time they ratified the Monte Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, by the convention declared "the common heritage of humanity".
There's no state in here anymore.
The right of exercise in this area shall be granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
"The bottom of the sea, however, is not a Klondike," says chief Mikulka at the outset, saying that his "single areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually protected."
Czech in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other countries of some Eastern bloc within the framework of the Interoceanmetal Joint Organisation.
In 1991, it was awarded under the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, the status of the so-called "proactive investor".
He has the authority to operate in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area studied by the investor is much bigger than the former Czechoslovakian.
The bottom is part of it, it's about some kind of underwater replica of Tater.
"There can be a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich location for polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and mangan," another lawyer Ind Pakshi Rajan says.
Macedonian worker Rober Sandev brings one such particular to the show.
He remembers a little potato or, in a little fantasy, a wonderful one that, according to legend, revived Golem.
Germany's special deployment units were at the time of the release of arms
The Egyptian government has requested the help of experts in resolving the crisis with the arms of Germany.
When the situation got worse, the special units were ready, but the installation failed.
Further details of the circumstances of freedom of 11 in Egypt are gradually available to the public.
According to the data provided by the Ministry of Defence and within, German special forces were also directly involved.
According to the Ministry, both Spolska Army experts and members of the anti-terrorist group of the German police GSG9, Spolko Police, the Spolko Criminal Office and technical assistance logistics experts (Technische Hilfswerk) were released.
According to another statement, however, German forces were not required by the two ministers from Monday afternoon because the prisoners left their prisoners to go and flee when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Government of Egypt has accepted the aid offered by Germany as a supporting force for action on the ground.
"There was no luck," said one of the spokespersons of the Ministry of Social Affairs inside.
The attackers took away a group of passengers made up of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanians, and also eight their Egyptian leaders on 19 September south of Egypt.
After the Exodus in the wilderness region of southern Egypt, they moved hostages in border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the abductions has remained unclear for the last time, as well as details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
Currently, there are rescues in Kahir.
Minister Steinmeier said the release of the hostages is in the care of the German Embassy.
The details of the release did not appear.
In Berlin no information is available yet when the rescue will be returned to Germany.
According to the "Bild" list, all five tourists would have to fly off with special forces one of the Airbuss of Germany and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
American Snow representatives rejected the rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has had a close majority drop in the savings package for the financial markets worth $700 billion.
The Dow Jones index has gone down a lot.
In a ratio of 206 to 227 votes, the United States of America rejected the government's savings package for the financial markets.
Despite the challenges of American President George W. Bush and the leaders of both sides, for a programme that should alleviate the chaos in the financial markets, most have not found.
The dramatic action was desperate by the supporters to convince the critics of the package worth $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called on the MP to vote in favour, even though, as he said, the plan is not popular.
"It is difficult to gain political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for the concerns of investors was that the state rescue package could fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index was raised so that after the notice of exhaustion the package would fall again.
Experts are now counting on other serious turbulences in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, the Senate and the Senate should agree.
Travel agents record increasing booking numbers
It seems that winter will be good for German entrepreneurs in travel:
According to one study, in the next month's booking of trips, it grew significantly compared to the previous year - in the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite weak economic growth, the taste of German travel remains unencumbered.
In the winter season, the travel officers recorded an increase of 31 per cent compared to the same period last year, as the German Traveller Reiseverband (DRV) reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK market research institute, increased bookings are already available for the autumn months.
Thus, according to the RDV as of October, the turnover was approximately 11 per cent higher than in 2007.
The basis for these results is the GfK numbers, which each month evaluates data on reservations from 1200 German travel offices and interpolates them on the whole market.
As a result, the reservation of the tickets that took place by the end of August 2008 was included.
Due to the low dollar price, they are requested primarily to travel to the United States, the DRV reported.
There's about one third of the reservation increases these routes.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic water, are particularly targeted by the Germans.
Above all, organised tours are in course, said President Dr. Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising energy and food expenditures, here are the costs "for customers of energy to be counted rather than for individually organised holidays".
Leafple explained that the money can save consumers, among other things, by using slavs for a temporary reservation or all-inclusive offer.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was very good, so compared to the previous year, it will again be recorded a higher turnout - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first October party
A dodecanese repeated poppy, a brew of tubulars and prominent in the roofs of known designers.
For the first time in a beer pot.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, a TV moderator, and she's wearing a quiet eardrum.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is from a secondhand.
But one thing connects us: we're not even three minutes on the beer bench, and the photographers are already throwing up on us, and they're really full of memory cards - it's embarrassing for me, I'm on October 1st.
That's how you can make friends.
Looks like my cheap roof has fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the Blobás equation, and so my sense of comfort in the circuit was more limited.
But right after coming to Theresienwies, everything's better than it seemed.
Nearly everyone wears a woman's shirt or leather pants; no one looks down or shamelessly touched - everything is perfectly normal.
The special views of the banana stand in the chocolate can only be my shield.
One Mnichovanka reminds me that I mistook her: "You're on the left, in the middle of the lady, the right to the left, behind the widow."
They're going to cross the mask behind the left.
"Okay," he says and smiles.
The others with subtle flirting techniques don't get so much fun and they have simple stuffed hats on them with the inscription "It's a drink to get dressed!" and they run on the rounding of our ass.
A young man with such displayist tendencies is called Bob, who came from England and at Octoberfest, too.
He looks like a gorgeous, with a long "oh."
It'll tell me after you've just taken off your drunk husband.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everybody thinks they're garbage.
So Bob's one of the scared Wildbieslers, as in Bavaria, it's called, to the public, free-drinking people.
The rest of the luck to get rid of this kind of alcohol doesn't exist.
At eight o’clock in the evenings, there is an area where the Oktoberfest is taking place, and a few doctors who have to take care of the skyscrapers.
The doctors always show up in the hennas - in four they wear a hidden vest from the apartment to the apartment.
They work like most of the guests of the beer shop: empty there, full back.
Whoever's lying under the cover of this miscarriage isn't visible.
"It's the only ones who can't go on," he calls me in answer to my question one of the doctors and disappears in the dust.
Police published the name of the victim of an accident
The name of a 30-year-old woman who died in a hospital after she was hit by a car in Essex was published.
An accident at Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon struck Carole Paulson from the darkest Chelmsford Road.
She was transferred to Queen's Hospital in Romeford, but she died later.
After the accident, a man was arrested for suspected inadvertently driving.
He's already been released for police bail.
Turkey's diplomatic views are expanding
Long before Turkey began its efforts to join the European Union, European powers were keen to penetrate the Turkish border.
On the eastern coast of Bospor, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, is one of the best memories of this unsuccessful imperial ambition.
The Hydarpaš railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a non-renesan style.
Well, that's what the tourist guide tells you.
The building sits on the opposite end of the tower at every corner of the corner, overlooking the non-recognition of some provincial German council.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But as soon as a man gets inside the nested treasure, he can no longer doubt the size of the firm whose most western gate was.
In August 1908, the German consortium of Anatoli-Baghdad Corporation opened the station.
Germany, which was involved in the empire's game late, intended to realize its ambition to control the Middle East by means of this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and further to the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions grew during the first world war.
Their colleagues were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from the surrounding areas, caused by frozen borders of cold war, is away
British and colonial units have come from Egypt and expelled Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And bad news came for Hydarpash's station too.
In 1917, the explosion of a military train destroyed its working roof.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
Since then, she's been being sexually abused and she's been treated in history.
Today, however, this gate to Anatolia continues to serve - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding views of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling party Justice and Development - AKP - created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from surrounding areas, created by frozen borders of cold war, is gone.
The new policy is now in place - Turkey is committed.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has a good relationship with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I landed on a night train in the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I had to meet with one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a car ride on the wheels that reminded the ancient world rhythms of the famous Night Post document, I arrived at the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for the secular state, which wants to turn back to its Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamic roots, represents a paradigm of Turkish consensus.
In the West, there was a suspicion, especially in Washington.
Taxi brought me to the main AKP state, ultra-modern stone and metal building, deliberately built on the developing suburb, surrounded by half-drunk commercial houses and power shops, where middle managers in commercial clothing - men and women - meet to make fast early trades.
Suat Kinikioglu could be a mid-term policy from almost every other European political party.
Sack, tie, I'm sure he had Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
The Cold War was anomaly," he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its border.
Today he has to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
He had to do both of them.
"But I'm sure the time will come," I asked, "when might Turkey have to decide?"
"Turecko," he said, "didn't want it to come to such a decision."
Then he stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost in memory: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea are just as well for the benefit of Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, follow these wheels east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpaš station, after the next majority of the night, I thought of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who were following how this building was built a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found out that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, essentially, in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting in the harbor for a ferry back through Bospor, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "a sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least at that time there was not much doubt that the continent should have a claim on this fascinating country.
Memorial lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical leader since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrolog, September 11th) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Congregation.
As part of the periodic music plan, he founded the year on the excellent Youth Proteus.
He was about 21 years old, but at the time that Proteus was singing last in 1979, some of us were almost 30 - we simply refused to give up.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape changer) represented the will and the ability of the congregation to play any music that was presented to him - whether made by Madrigali or by Messiaen, whether alone or with the whole orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young congregation was often amazing, always exciting, and all because of the inspiration of the one man and the enthusiasm for music that remained completely unchanged all the time.
How often did Todd just tell us to "let the music speak for ourselves"?
He said, "The treasurer knows what he wants.
It's all in that music.
So sing it!"
His tattoo technique was quite clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor prolific.
No matter where the music standard was, he always took it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a conductor was supposed to be fit for the knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades when he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years, I have reviewed over 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed - and I have been inspired many times.
Todd Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated the conductors who, according to his words, simply "drawed one or two faggots around the world."
There'll be a lot of us missing.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your nephew William Woodruff (September 25th) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Hoblon-Norman... and at the same time studied at BSc, MA and PhD".
This comes from Woodruff's notes by the author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not exactly.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he did a dissertation work on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a British rubber industry publication.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Hoblon-Norman and in 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff took this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resiny "Flemenco and Life", because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was entrusted with the simplicity and strength of the action of the spectators and the consideration and respect of the photographers.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino can catch magic moments."
The second Honda attacks with his bestseller
In November, Honda's second generation of Jazz models are being sold.
If the front of this single-space vehicle has already had significant space, it now offers even more spacious interior.
This is accompanied by improved engines that increase the comfort of driving and allow greater fuel savings.
Evolution is more than revolution.
That's the second generation of Hondy Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, many changes have occurred on this one-space vehicle.
You should mention, for example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Even before we examine the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz is coming on the market six years after the first generation was introduced.
So the first thing we can remember is the fact that Honda needed a shorter period than other producers to cool down this model.
Although Jazz is a less-known model in Europe, in other markets it became a phenomenon in sales.
This is the case in Japan, the country where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
In Japan, almost a million pieces have been sold since Hondy Jazz was placed on the market.
The second market became an old continent with about half a million pieces sold in six years.
Honda, however, sets out to increase the sale of the new Jazz in his category.
Thus, while in 2007, this Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 pieces of Hondy Jazz, in 2009 estimates are estimated to be 100,000 cars, which would increase by 17% on the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, since 2002, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 pieces of the Jazz model, which is 6.7% of the total sales of Hondy in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of Jazz, the Spanish leadership is expected to sell 2,000 pieces a year.
The exact arrival of the new Jazz will allow the Hondua to significantly mitigate the decrease in sales in Spain.
Car driving is expected to be de facto, with a total number of 22,000 pieces sold, which means 4 000 less than in 2007 and a decrease of 16 %.
Honda, despite this increase in sales, increased its share in the Spanish market to 1,8 %, compared with 1,6 % of last year.
In 2010, this Japanese company expected to reach 2%.
To achieve this part, Honda depends on the success of his next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-dimensional hybrid compact size of 4,37 meters long, from which the Japanese company promises worldwide sales of about 200,000 pieces a year.
In the case of markets, 50 % of the Japanese producer estimates are sold to Insight in the United States, while the remaining percentage will split the old continent and Japan.
The start of the sale of Hondy Insight is expected in the first months of next year as soon as the public is represented in Valencia in January.
On the contrary, the first generation of the new Jazz has increased all sizes.
Its length has increased to 3.9 metres (five cm more), a width of 1.69 metres (two cm more) and a recovery of 2.5 metres, meaning a length of five cm.
The height, on the other hand, hasn't changed and is still 1.52 meters.
Increased dimensions have also increased the inner space.
However, this advantage was achieved by using a new platform, but by putting the fuel tank in the middle of the vehicle that had already been used in the previous Hondy Jazz.
Also the volume of the pocket space - which has a double bottom system - increased by up to 399 litres, by 19 litres more than the volume of the pocket space in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur with engine 1.4, because the volume of the pocket space at Hondy Jazz 1.2 makes 379 litres.
Another improvement in addition to external elements - such as rear lights or the possibility of equipped with a polished panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seat.
The door leading to the second row of seats allows the angle of opening 80 degrees against 67 in the first Jazz model.
In the second generation of Hondy Jazz, there are new engines.
From the beginning, this small model will be offered with two petrol engines of 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and brings excellent improvements in the fuel system at the same time as a high-speed moment in full engine range.
The first engine with a volume of 1,2 litres has 90 horses with a maximum torque of 114 Nm with a maximum torque of 6 000 horses.
This motor - which had a previous generation of Jazz 78 horses - has a consumption of 5.3 litres and emissions 125 grams of CO2.
In contrast to the previous engine that reached 83 horses in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with power of 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and emissions 128 grams of CO2.
"Cars" prohibits collisions
In order to advance the development of anti-infectious technologies, Nissan was inspired this time in nature, specifically by the bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes as a model the fly of the rabbits, and thus prohibits collisions.
This is the bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which represents the first step in cutting prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Center for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. robot developed the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo in collaboration with the Centre for Progress in Scientific and Technological Research.
According to Kazuhira Doie, the Director General of Public Relations for Technology, Research and Brand Development, BR23C is presented as an extension of the four Nissan security shield zone.
The robot is intended to enhance the ability to prevent collisions on the vehicles of this brand.
During the summer, each pupil creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to the safety shield of Nissan.
However, the most important are compounded eyes that are able to see in all directions in an angle of more than 300 degrees, allowing in particular to fly in their personal space without stopping.
When creating this visual function, the engineers proposed what they called the Laser Range Finder.
It records the obstacles that are located up to two metres from the distance of 180 degrees before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the deck microprocessor, which will immediately pass it on to the collision warning.
"At a time when the obstacle is recorded, the robot is like the target of the motion and immediately changes the direction of the circle to the right or even larger angle to prevent the impact.
The greatest difference to any existing system is the fact that all geared maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and the main engineer of this project.
The robot cannot move upwards or downwards, its movement is limited only to two dimensions and to a direction that is enabled by the rotation of its wheel, but not in an infinite amount of directions and possibilities as in the neck.
Nissan therefore also used the rotation function in addition to speeding and slowing to prevent the impact of the robot.
"The device only needs to process information every few seconds and to be kept in accordance with these data.
It does not require the storage of information or logical intuitions from previous maneuvers, so it can work without interrupting with just two inches of memory.
It may surprise you, but we don't talk about giga or mega in memory."
This is the first step in the development of new technologies, the immediate prevention of bumps, the technology that Nissan predicts the use of serial cars in ten years.
Robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the creation of a unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the goal and avoid obstacles on the road.
Enjoy your fear before you take the mortgage
It should be acknowledged that the US Ministry of Finance, in addition to having sufficient capital for injecting, does not lack any ingenuity.
Faced with a crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages at a bank with questionable solvency, he created a popular-scientific game "Bad Credit Hotel" on the Internet.
It doesn't hurt "The Hotel of Bad Credits" or a crowded hotel.
The hotel and its receptions in particular seem intimidating so that one can think once, twice and three times about whether it's the right time to ask for credit.
And then above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is, the game contains useful information, even if you are not too detailed.
It's a site that's more suitable for young people than space for the whole public.
And what happens when the game ends?
There's a dream room inside the hotel.
At least because you don't want to talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital MUFG
The Banking House Morgan Stanley announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank that spends $9 billion to obtain 21% of its capital, had a significant decrease in its stock exchange.
The two banks explained that MUFG was planning to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a single cost of $25.25, representing the total amount of three billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the accounting value of the securities by 31 August.
The bank of MUFG invests another six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities, which will provide it with a 10% return and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley explained that the whole operation would be carried out on the basis of an average single price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28 % under its current price.
Morgan Stanley still lost 6.79% and got around $13.07 in greenwich time.
"This strategic link represents an important opportunity on the way to speed up the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of banking holding," explained John Mack, Director General of this American Group.
The new statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which is intended to enable him to break up his activities, but it also places him under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His association with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest essay from Wall Street to take a far more careful approach than before.
The conditions presented on Monday, inter alia, indicate that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday Morgan only announced that it sells up to 20 % of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"We thought just a week ago," explained Tokia Toshihide Misuno, executive director of MUFG, "that our participation will consist exclusively of ordinary actions.
However, given the current situation in the economy and the market, we wanted to reduce the risks to the minimum and also to hide."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay for Morgan Stanley's valuable papers by 7 % less than their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a reduction in the profit from the share of about 20 %.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in a year if the latter are last appointed to be changed at a price of 50 % higher than the exchange price, i.e. about $47.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital that will bring the MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his cash.
However, the speaking groups refused to provide explicit information on the strategic projects of both new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to cover around 15% of Tier One's payment capacity, which is one of the best in the sector.
Morgan made it clear that since the end of August, "citizenly" had reduced his balance sheet.
The last few weeks were demanding for the group because its stock exchange rate was half, while the insurance costs against the risk of non-payments linked to the long-term growth.
These costs were the opposite of developments on Monday, but remained high, about 12 %.
Last week Goldman Sachs announced, the only other "survivor" from the big Wall Street investment bank on the banks Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merril Lynch, that she chose $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Re-establishing the republic around socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuela Hugo Chavez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third speaker submitted a draft of the new Constitution to the vote, in the form of his opponents and friends.
And his mission was fulfilled, as 64 % of the voters, according to the official results of 80 % of the votes, voted in the "yes" referendum.
"No" according to these results was 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0,7% of the ballots were empty.
To accept the proposal of the Constitution, he had to get half the votes plus one.
Two polls carried out on the exit from the electoral premises and the budget of the non-governmental organisation predicted a clear victory Sunday, with a range of 63% to 70%.
The rest of the night of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa demanded the victory of his proposal of the Constitution.
"The Constitution won the whole race," assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians in the province of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers south-west of Quit.
They understand themselves that Rafael Correa was blessed by Chavez and Morales, but also by his Chilean opponent, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was held in peace by the United States of America's (OEA) observation mission, referred to the text on 444 points that would be the "new socialism" promoted by the President.
The proposal of the Constitution gives the State power over the economy by replacing it with the "development planning" of a country that lives primarily from the demand of oil to foreign companies and from the currency that its immigrants send.
The proposal by Correou, who was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of the State, which will be able to carry out two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the recording.
Correa has already announced that this power will be exercised and will be replaced by a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution, among other things, confirms the principle of free health and education, which the President has begun to introduce in the country with 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also includes banning the presence of foreign armies, which will conclude an agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of the Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
19 arms were released in Chad
The Egyptian team took the hostages of eleven tourists and their eight-fold escorts, which were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who had been detained in the desert for ten days, were transported alive and healthy on Monday to the Egyptian capital.
During the morning, an Egyptian command was released in Chad.
Handicrafts flew in about 15.30, apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft at the Al-Maza military base, closely adjacent to the international airport in Kahir.
They were immediately transferred without being able to express themselves in the press, on board a helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, the district resident of Kahiry, to be covered by medical examinations.
"They are completely healthy" and "no ransom has been paid to the unions," Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zohjer Garran said on the road route.
Since its capture on September 19 during the safari in a vehicle with all four rounds at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages have been drawn from one hiding place to another 35 unknown kidnappings.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptian leaders: two guides, four drivers, one foreign director of the agency of Egypttous, organizers of safari.
A leading representative of the Egyptian safety components indicated that 30 members of the special units, who approached the site on board the two helicopters, had gone to a stand during the night just before dawn.
"The shooter was born, half the kidnappings were killed and the others fled," said this source, who wanted to remain anonymous.
He pointed out that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the "bulk" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian teams.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini, from Belgrade where he is, mentioned the role played by secret agents and Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professional and efficient people of our secret services, the special forces," he said without further clarification.
He also denied that the ransom would be paid.
On the night before, the Sudanese army declared that it had kept a vehicle running all four rounds on board, including the Chadian commander and two prisoners.
The army claimed that they were linked to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Movement for the Liberation of Sudan - Unit (SLA-U), which immediately refused the said movement.
Letters - Most of the cultural resort
The debate on funding culture fills the pages with new thumb headlines and is the theme of the campaign currently under way.
That's better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will rise to predict the poor sums provided by small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national monuments that are starving?
What politics dares to remind the federal government that they remember their memories and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, like in Canada, we don't have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros on the restoration of a single Chinnon castle in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbours have written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture and that this heritage should be protected by all citizens, by all elected representatives and by all national organisations, and in society.
In Quebec, in the federation of companies for the history of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers are working to combine up to 211 companies for history, memory, archives and geology on the discovery of history, the preservation of a collection of private archives and the protection of archaeological remains for a few small ones.
Often these companies are watching the dogs of our memories, which are unhopefully protesting when promoters and leading agents release their bulldozers to old stones and forgotten graves.
When do we finally meet for history and memory courts?
The governments of Benelux, the rest of the bank of Fortis
The States of Benelux will assist the Belgian-Holland Bank of Fortis, which as the first in Europe, has been in difficulty as a result of the widening effect of the US mortgage market crisis, partial restructuring: the three countries will support the monetary and insurance institution, which also has a capital participation in Hungary, amounting to EUR 11.2 billion.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed to participate in the European Central Bank and European Commissioner for Economic Competition this weekend.
Fortis is the first in the euro area that has been in a large crisis in the international financial markets crisis that has spread in the waves for more than a year, and the decision taken in this matter could, from a certain point of view, be considered as a precedent.
In the sense of the decision that was made on Sunday night, all three countries will buy almost half (49 per cent) of the bank's property.
The bank, with absolute certainty, sells part of its equity, especially then - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
The bank shares fortis started to fall early last week, the second half of the week, the institution already showed serious signs of the crisis.
However, analysts agree that with their 85 thousand employees, the bank is too large to be harmed.
The company's securities fell only 12 per cent on Friday, at a minimum of 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current stock prices, the overall market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but it is not realistic, according to the company’s leading representatives.
The management of the company is also responsible for the fall in Fortis' shares in the maritime market related to the adoption of the US package plan of $700 billion.
On Monday, the shares got a little steeper.
On Friday, the new Director General Philip Dierckx was appointed to the head of the bank.
The monetary institution also sought out private buyers, but with a more serious offer, no one has submitted yet.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors must not be afraid, that their money will not come.
The bank's clients haven't panicked yet, and the sidewalks have not been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also collected several leasing companies.
Gum in the cornea
Life and health insurance in America, based on people's data on the purchase of medicines, often rejects the possibility of entering into an insurance contract with the buyer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme that weighs on the use of prescription data in each case for the authorisation of the person concerned.
This must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we believe the root of the fox," quoted Washington Post Richard Dick, author of the program for monitoring prescriptions.
Insurance undertakings shall make insurance and the amounts paid in the case of insurance events dependent on the health of the persons concerned and, where the risk is assessed as too large, insurance shall not close it.
They had previously sent the relevant medical examinations and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: on the basis of an identification number, the customer from the doctor will easily find out what medication he bought for the last year and half, from which the program itself runs out of which he suffers from the disease and what his condition is.
For example, if she regularly buys a large amount of cholesterol-lowering medicines, it indicates that she has practically uncontrollable high blood fat levels, which will immediately be classified as a higher risk category.
Several versions of the programme are currently under way, some of them also identify the risk factor, so there is almost no work left, although there are minor problems.
For example, some compounds can be used to treat migraine or fever, but they are also effective against depression.
They represent a significant risk-increasing factor from the commercial insurance perspective, which is not the first known difficulty.
In order to request and process data, special companies have been established which require a patient's authorisation prior to receiving the necessary information from the physician.
To this end, it is already forced by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their present insecurity.
Some companies have recently been working on the results of laboratory examinations, which are linked to the data on the medicinal products used, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the medical condition of patients.
The data has access to more and more companies, while monitoring their use will be more and more complicated.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to providers of health services and insurance.
The proposal for a law that gives the authorities the power to control and companies specialising in the provision of data is before the Congress.
Richard Dick admits that this is not enough: therefore, he developed his program in such a way that data transmission is linked to the explicit consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the permit in question can only be difficult to resist, otherwise insurance will not close the contract with him.
So the monkeys are just a little off on the leaf of good will.
Global Marseille Menu
The European Union and India double the turnover
Since the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, the theme is also guided by other, mainly global issues, including the number of summits held at the highest level.
Today will also be the French-India summit, which will focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is developing democratic power, which should be given a greater opportunity to speak on international issues, but Member States have not yet managed to find a common nominee in support of the continued membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question has not yet been resolved at the ninth summit held in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy as currently President of the Union, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who also agreed to double the turnover by five years, or increase by more than one hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, there is no excessive ambition.
In this respect, twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation were legally agreed, so green air transport was brought to a future and air transport.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that the negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Dilli is among the EU's partners to the ninth place.
The Summit also paid attention to the global issue.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, has been condemned by both parties in all its forms and called for an accelerated convening of the UN conference.
They also ordered the end of the Dauha trade round, although they both have a great share in his modern health.
The European Union has confirmed that it will continue on its energy and climate programme, because it would like to reduce the emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India also agreed, as well as that the climate conference for next year would need to conclude a global agreement and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 per cent by 2050.
Both parties would also like to prevent food price increases and support the convening of an international conference to address the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Prime Minister joins the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting, he is about to close the trade in the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris believes that the commitment to build Indian nuclear reactors worth EUR 20 billion is made by French companies.
The Agency reports that the agreement should be valid for 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Great participation of Italian publishers at the international library fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers are participating in the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from hundreds of different countries to take 171,790 metres of square fairs with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as an honest guest.
The Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the opening ceremony in the Italian pavilion: Italy is actually participating institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – on 264 metres of quarterly exhibition grounds.
It will follow the press meeting in Room Structure Buchmesse in pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books of foreign authors is still being reduced in relation to total Italian production, mainly in the light of literature for children and adults.
Found a plane of Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of the aircraft was found by Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared on 3 February 2007, while flying through the desert in Nevada.
The Troskys were discovered at one level above sea level three thousand metres, in the area of Mammoth Lakes in Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
But there were no human remains inside the aircraft.
Sheriff Madeira County, John Anderson, shared the doubts that remained: "The plane was found, we sent the team there, and now we are sure that this is exactly what Steve Fossett flew on the day he disappeared" said at a press conference.
The sheriff explained that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old is considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) announced that several hours after recognition of the concerns, an investigation team was sent that finally identified the aircraft: it was exactly Bellanca 8kcab, not reported since 3 February 2007, when Fossett flew from Yerington to Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border with Nevada, some of Fossett's personal objects were found near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both published by Illinois Federal Air Force, cash and one bundle.
The search for Fossetta was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
A billionaire has won a place in history thanks to a long collection of championships.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete his journey around the world in the air balloon: two weeks of the year alone.
Three years later, he flew the world on a plane and didn't land.
Among its many records are also the flight of 15,445 meters above Anda, even with the copilot.
Glk, a commercial you don't expect
One unusual suv with original design and precisely defined by determined lines, wide surfaces with exact corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk of the "compact" jeeps of the star house, by which Mercedes-Benz tried to introduce faith news into this sector.
Just thanks to its non-traditional processing, it will be unexpected and unconventional and communication that will accompany the launch of Suv Glk on the market and which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the next 17 October.
This way the advertising campaign, which follows the debut of the new vehicle, also launches an informal way of communication thanks to a futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which was first used in Italy for the car brand.
The Maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milan trade class, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication begins by introducing a car in stereoscopic vision and using special glasses, which will be distributed near Corsa Como, will be possible to see a new suv in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
In fact, if you look at the picture, you'll feel that the car's leaving the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its smalls, so that it can then be re-constituted in a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce this ad to something new in the stereotype area of car communication.
Will he be able to stimulate the interest of future customers in this way?
So we know who the Italian chulgans are.
From Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been watching Nazionale Azurra for years, and which, as it is true, has never done any overlooked problems.
She never even met an opponent's fans.
The group's orientation is right.
The founders come from Trivenet.
Veron, Padovy, Tersta and Udine.
In Sofia groups were added (in fact few groups) to Campania and Puglie.
They have three-coloured flags showing the cities of origin of the participants: on Saturday night they removed them so that they would not be recognized.
They're inspired by English fans.
They found real Nazi fans in Bulgaria, Levsky.
Figc gave the Italian fans 144 tickets to the match: all by name, so easy to control.
And Viminale really checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Daslem, no one who would be forbidden to visit the stadium.
Four blue fans who had earlier stadium offenses were denied entry and denied a fight.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the news that will come from the Bulgarian police, then take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo to at least five years of fans who were arrested or those who were identified during the emergency.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our chuligans, briefly, don't even jump to one stadium.
Good luck.
But now there is fear of emulation: this means that more than one hundred fifty are added to them.
"We must immediately cease this fire and not justify those who behave in this way," they confirm from Viminal.
So, "well-opened eyes, mainly due to a national strike in the middle of Leči."
In Puglia, there's a small core of supporters.
Tomorrow, Osservatorio, on Tuesday Casms, who can also count with one part of Aise, is a secret service that deals with the problems at the stadiums.
"Collect leader-in-chief and a panda on Mamelia's gymnasium?
This is the idea of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a very little happy way), which is a few weeks old director of the Viminal Observatory (getting a place that was formerly Francesca Tagliente and then Felice Ferrizi).
Mazzilli was formerly a Quaestor in Terst, where there is a core of Ultras Italia's supporters, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the leader, but of course the conduct of these 150-200 fans is a shame.
"I am not a sociologist - he delivers the Osservatorian unit - the crimes are committed to the country in which they became.
So far, this group has been on the line, now we're looking very closely at what happened and we're going to evaluate for the future.
But let us also speak of the resurrection of Mameli in humility: it is not even a crime, but if you allow it, it is ignorance....
