Rapid cumulative incidence of coronary disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/ European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary disease cases (COVID-19) shows similar trends in European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although it is at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and ICUs should prepare themselves more for an outflow of patients with COVID-19 who will need care and, above all, intensive treatment.
On 31 December 2019, a portion of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, in Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China informed the causeant agent as being a new coronavirus, now referred to as coronavirus 2 from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronary disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, i.e. an infection of respiratory tract with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease, requiring hospitalization, while 6% of remaining cases evolve into a critical disease, requiring intensive treatment.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we evaluated trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom and compared them with those in the Province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with that of Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, the COVID-19 spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following in that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as pandemic.
The Eurosurveillance 2020 edition of 5 March, Spiterie et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe, according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan in Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, the cases of COVID-19 had already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and between 31 December 2019 and the date mentioned above, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths only in Italy.
Collection of cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated every day at 8 a.m.
These data were used to assess the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare them with those of Italy.
As an approach to the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, taking into account, therefore, the natural evolution of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases notified by each country by 15 March 2020 at 8 a.m. and compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
Trends in the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed those in the Province of Hubei in China (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then significantly increased around 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed similar increases in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom as compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It points out that by 15 March at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This happens even though countries are at different stages, variations in the actions of national public health systems and possibly different definitions of cases in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients that should be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including testing for updating.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive treatment, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive treatment units in those regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization by COVID-19 in a hospital and/or ICU are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data with focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ICU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal for every 100,000 people.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of ICU and semi-intensive treatment for a population of 100,000 between 2010 and 2011).
Modelled scenarios related to the saturation of the health system, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and for the United Kingdom of the prevalence of cases of hospitalization by COVID-19 associated with a risk greater than 90% of the capacity for intensive care are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
In view of the fact that cases have so far been concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care units generally address a defined population of regional scope, information on cases and intensive care beds should be made available preferably in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's example and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The countries, hospitals and ICUs should therefore prepare themselves for a Community-supported transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who will need medical care, especially intensive treatment, as is the case in the affected regions of Italy.
In line with the ECDC's rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change in the containment approach for a mitigation approach, since the rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their actions appropriately, if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to intensify their control initiatives to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the health system.
If these initiatives fail, it is likely that the health systems of other EU/EEA countries will have an outbreak of patients who will need intensive treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The epidemic of coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 disease (SARS-CoV-2) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has already killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a population catastrophe.
Similar to its homologous virus, the SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, the SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the bites and caused similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissive, and affects older people than young people, and more men than women.
As a response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive evaluation of the research object, which is being developed quickly.
We will discuss the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this study will help to understand and eradicate this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 became a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to stay confined to the entire holiday and for several weeks thereafter due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was called SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease was called CoV-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country and around 50 other countries around the world.
By 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 recovered patients and more than 3,000 dead patients.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number one", and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles were published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the isolated virus of several patients.
This article aims to summarize the progress of research in this new fast development area.
Where relevant, we will compare COVID-19 with SARS and the other disease caused by CoV, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, an epidemic of 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as other urgent issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of the common colds.
However, in this century, we found twice human coVs highly pathogenic, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing an epidemic that originated in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which then spread to several other countries with morbidity and morbidity.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third coV epidemic in the documented history of the human being.
As demonstrated in Fig..1, a proportion of pneumonia cases with unknown origins was initially reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was published.
On 15 January 2020, Wuhan's first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to the cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On January 20, the health professionals' contagion was reported, suggesting that transmission among people was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was confined, with all its public transport interrupted.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of 41 patients with confirmed cases only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan sea fruit market, which was considered the starting point of the infection by an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
Until the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and around 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
Since the situation is rapidly worsening, the size and final severity of the epidemic should still be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a study of several centres with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed with COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic, as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, mainly in the age range of 30 to 65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected were over 50 years of age, some were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread in groups, mainly in Hubei and its environment.
COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the occurrence of symptoms.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean time of death based on the onset of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) days.
The basic reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, corresponding to the mass transport time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate in confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%) and the mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (greater than 60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and encapsulated viruses containing a single chain of RNA with a certain meaning.
They can be divided into four genres, namely: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which it is known that alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses infect human beings.
The glucoprotein spike (S) of the envelope joins its cellular receptors of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) and dipeptidedil peptidease 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively and subsequently the membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released in cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA followed by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins forms vesiculars containing viruses, which join the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on 10 January 2020.
It was discovered that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequential samples collected from the same place of exit, the Huaan Sea Fruit Market in Wuhan.
SARS-COV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-COV than MERS-COV.
Through the electronic transmission microscope, the SARS-CoV-2 particles were discovered in ultrafine sections of the epithelium of human airways.
It was discovered that human ECA2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, S-protein from SARS-CoV-2 joins the human protein ECA2 in a weaker way than the SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by orf3b and a secret protein coded by orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may perform a function on viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, the orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or reason.
On 18 February 2020 Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM structure of the ECA2 of total human length to the resolution of 2.9 Å in a complex with the carrier of amino acids B0AT1.
It was discovered that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped as a digit, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can combine two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection by CoV.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug selection to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediary
It is known that both SARS-COV and MERS-COV originated from the bites and were transmitted to human beings through civets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the bats were considered native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two CoVs of bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host who helped the virus cross the barriers of species and infect human beings remains unknown, and the route of transmission still needs to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that the snakes transport the virus from the bites to human beings, which involved a homologous recombination in the protein S.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins, long-term focinomas that feed on ants and are frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine are potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on genetic homologies of 99% between a coV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference in two genomes is a big difference; therefore, final results for concrete evidence are being expected (Fig.33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 °C with humidity of 40% to 50%.
SARS-COV-2 may have similar properties.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and to the heat of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, chlorine disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform and other organic solvents, but not chloroxidine, are effective in disabling the virus.
In general, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported in relation to the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only consult previous studies on other CoVs, mainly on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's immune system by means of patterns-recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectine receptors, type Toll receptor (TLR), type NOD receptor (NLR) and type RIG-I receptor (RLR).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of I-type interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV protein N can help the virus escape from immune responses.
In a short time, the immune response is adaptive to the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the defense.
T CD4+ cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and T CD8+ cells directly kill cells infected by the virus.
Co-operating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing the apoptosis of T cells.
Humor immunity, including supplements such as C3a and C5a antibodies, is also essential for combating viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated reaction of the immune system generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst cases, multiple failure of the organs, and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the occurrence of symptoms in a group of people, affects the elderly with comorbidities and pregnant women more.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a higher chance of being infected than other people.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days and, most of the time, from 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days, on average, and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demographic of 8.866 cases.
It is essential that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected people who do not have symptoms from transmitting the virus to other people.
As a current practice, individuals exposed to the virus or infected by it usually need to stay in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended for 24 days?
The fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which can come alone or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, lack of air, muscle pain, vertigo, headache, throat pain, corsis, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of symptoms of the disease.
In serious cases, patients rapidly evolved to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or acute respiratory and fever symptoms, even without abnormality in the lung image diagnosis, should go through screening for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for February, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnoea and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group with transmission of an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that patients in the MERS-CoV also presented fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients needed ventilator support, much more than the COVID-19 patients, which consisted of the greater mortality of COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, it was demonstrated that fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnoea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 25%) and throat pain (13% to 25%) were the main symptoms, and ventilation support was needed for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
By 14 February, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2%, when the cases confirmed in the world reached 66,576.
In comparison, the mortality of SARS by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study of June 2012, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the baseline number of SARS-CoV-2 reproduction was up to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (IC) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the SARS-CoV R0 ranged from 2 to 4 only.
A comparison of SARS-COV-2 with MERS-COV and SARS-COV in relation to its symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-COV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but is less lethal than those two last.
Therefore, it is a much greater challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemic.
The occurrence of symptoms in a group of people usually occurs in the same family or in the same agglomeration or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact individuals or patients infected in the two weeks before symptoms appear.
However, it has been reported that people can load the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms, and the cured patients who have received high from hospitals can counter the virus again, which creates an alarm so that the time of quarantine is extended.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells in the peripheral blood (mainly lymphocytes) at the initial stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cells count below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte count below 1 x 109/L, and high levels of aminotransferase aspartate and viraemia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of enzymes and myoglobins in the muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimero-D, a product of fibrin degradation in the blood, was high, and lymphocyte count was gradually reduced.
The chest radiographic abnormalities are present in most patients with COVID-19, and have irregular bilateral shadows or opacity in the lungs.
Patients generally developed atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gas exchange.
Dysfunction of Type I and Type II pneumonia decreases surfactant levels and increases surface tension, thereby reducing lung capacity increases, and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most serious results of chest radiography generally correspond to the most serious form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the decomposition of pneumonia, the formation of hyalin membrane, the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and sinic cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which is consistent with viral infection and SDRA, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through polymerase chain reaction – reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for the diagnosis (which did not become exclusively derived from RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and essential to achieve an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the SHERLOCK technique, based on CRISPR, to detect SARS-COV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of the SARS-COV-2 RNA in 20 x 10-18 mol/L to 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microlitre of input) using a measuring range in less than one hour, without the need for a complex instrumentation.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors can provide palliative treatment in the best of their ability for patients with COVID-19 while at the same time trying a variety of therapies that were used or previously proposed for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of cured patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of patients who recovered was suggested as treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are running against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser extent, other organs with expression of ECA2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygenation therapy, high flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary alternative technique used to treat heart failure or severe respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolytic balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of the functions of vital organs are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytokine cascade is known to result from an exacerbated reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine cascade is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNg, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce the cells of the immune system to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and the multiple failure of organs.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shells, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody anti-IL6, are being used to treat the cictocin cascade.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine cascade include modulation of the immune response to T cells; blocking IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab; suppressor of cytokines 4 signal; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe pulmonary injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They may cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, affecting dramatically the prognosis.
However, short periods of treatment with low to moderate corticosteroids were recommended for caution in patients with severe COVID-19.
When this article is written, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, it was found that intravenous administration with remedesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally intended for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remedesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other simple fita RNA viruses, including meRS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided the compound for China to perform some tests in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are being very expected.
In addition, baracitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin were suggested as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of treated patients and generation of antibodies
The blood collection of patients who have been treated with a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from contraction of the disease has a long history.
In fact, the treated patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies in the blood against the pathogen.
Antibodys are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralise them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who were treated with COVID-19, and was injected into 10 patients in a severe state.
His symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral load, and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the use of the large-scale method prior to the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some adverse reactions associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies may overstimulate the immune response and cause the cytokines release syndrome, which is potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma is large to treat patients in severe condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to combat an epidemic of global proportions.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate the B cells of treated patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or make a screening for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can quickly increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese Medicine, MTC, is used thousands of years ago to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend enormously on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on MTC theories.
Most effective components remain unknown, or are vague, since it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective treatments for COVID-19, MTC has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, or for patients recovering from severe stages of the disease.
For example, it was found that Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The best treatment rates for patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces in China that used MTC in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the Province of Hubei, which used CTC in only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, obtained the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many factors of impact, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a comparative study between the exclusive treatment with Western medicine and the combined treatment of Western medicine with MTC.
It was found that the time needed for the recovery of body temperature, for the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were significantly lower in the group treated by Western medicine and MTC than only in the group treated by Western medicine.
The worse rate of symptoms (from brand to serious) was significantly lower for the Western medicine group and MTC than for the Western medicine only group (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the Western medicine group and MTC than in the Western medicine only group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MTC still await more properly controlled tests on larger and more centres.
It would also be useful to characterize the mechanisms of action and to explain the effective components of MTC treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with COVID-19 or suspected of disease generally feel great fear of highly contagious disease and which can be fatal, and people in quarantine also feel inclined, lonely and irritated.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, may increase anxiety and psychological suffering.
In the initial phase of the SARS epidemic, several psychiatric morbidities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies, were reported.
The tracking of contacts and the compulsory quarantine, as part of the public health system's actions against the COVID-19 epidemic, can make people more anxious, and they can feel guilty about the effects of the infection, the quarantine, and the stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to persons suspected of disease and to persons who had contact with them, as well as to the general population, who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and precise updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal reservoirs and people infected with susceptible hosts, and are generally complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives were taken to develop protein-based vaccines S to generate powerful and durable neutralising antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and the models of lethal challenge and their protection against infection by zoonotic viruses still need to be determined before starting a clinical study.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and MES focus continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions, due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies were developed for MERS using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmoids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune individuals is an urgent and essential task for controlling the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the variations in the dynamics of the CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its full clinical evolution, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recovered gradually without sequelae.
However, in the same way as SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a forecast model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritise their services, especially in areas with scarce resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 affects mainly people between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive treatment were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not need intensive treatment (mean age 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a predictive factor for the health outcome of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who need intensive treatment are more likely to suffer acute cardiac injury or arrhythmia.
Cardiac episodes were the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also join positive ECA2 colangiocytes, which may lead to hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that the age and underlying diseases have strong correlation and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or injury in the tissue and was proposed as a potential prognosis factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation of the CRP level with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, elevated lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine quinase (CK) may also assist in predicting the result.
These enzymes are expressly present in several organs, mainly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: chest radiography and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other issues to predict the outcomes/complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are usually used as adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Given that a high dose of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent incapacity and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at a low dose and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: as described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from high stress, as they go through long periods of quarantine and uncertainty, and testify to the death of loved family members and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological advice and lasting support to help these patients recover from stress and restore normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have epidemiological characteristics different from those of SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be replicationd efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms at the initial stage of infection (or cause only mild symptoms), similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the initial phase or incubation period may produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, causing a great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients are severely ill, with most transmissions not occurring in the initial phase.
Therefore, the current epidemic of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the epidemic of SARS.
Major efforts are currently being made in China, including the continuance of Wuhan and neighboring cities, and the continuing quarantine of almost the entire population, in the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have dramatically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic ends by March, and the phase of deceleration lasts between 3 and 4 months.
However, other specialists are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which seems to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., set up a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the fractures of the throat and the middle cornet of patients who recovered and received high from the hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the new identified virus may become a cyclic episode similar to the influenza.
However, promising indications occurred in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that the current strategies could be working.
Originally, Ebola was expected to cause up to one million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with the quarantine and rigid isolation, the disease was kept under control, at last.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, in the same way as SARS-CoV, can become weaker with regard to its infectivity and at some point become a less pathogenic virus co-existing with human beings.
A comparison of the epidemic of COVID-19 with that of SARS and MERS is shown below (Fig. (Fig.55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly communicable by cough and spruce and possibly by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in faeces, which creates a new possibility: the oral-feetal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, greater caution should be taken to protect people, especially health professionals, social workers, family members, workmates and people with direct contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 breathing masks (series n° 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical facial masks prevent fluid droplets from being transported in the air from a potentially infected individual or adhere to the surface of the objects, where they can infect other people.
However, only the N95 masks (series n° 1860s) protect against the inhalation of viruses of 10 nm to 80 nm, with only 5% of the viruses being able to penetrate it completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, and both have approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five joint surgical masks, health professionals in direct contact with patients should use the N95 masks (series n° 1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals should use insulating clothing to further reduce contact with the virus.
The viruses also infect an individual through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected by SARS-CoV-2, although he was using a mask N95; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also use transparent facial protections or protective glasses when caring for patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash hands with disinfectant soap more frequently than normal, try to stay home in isolation and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A metro is considered an appropriate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection, as well as to prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new human virus, its high homologousness to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused a major warning to China, based on its recent history with the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, only on 19 January 2020 the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Centre calmed the citizens, saying that the new virus has a low rate of contagion and limited reproductiveity among human beings, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message left the most relaxed people, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for keeping the disease in Wuhan on a minimum scale was lost.
Disease control agencies in China can take advantage of this hard lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should: (1) be more careful when making public statements, since everything they say is absorbed by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from hospitals rather than waiting for formal communications from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic at their initial stage, rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) to issue more frequently targeted and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve the response system of society periodically.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread throughout China and around 50 other countries around the world at the time of writing this text.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the epidemic of COVID-19 generated a feeling of return from SARS.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the prevention of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than young people, and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate are also greater in older people than young people.
SARS has a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus when they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS generally transmit it when they are seriously ill, which makes it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains, in part, because SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-COV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, healed patients can receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of virus spread.
Given the rapid progress in the research on COVID-19, several crucial issues still need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a genetic counterpart of 96% has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs of pieces similar to SARS, we cannot yet conclude that SARS-CoV-2 has origin in the pieces.
What was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, from the morgue, say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions Nos 1 and 2, we will not be able to cut the transmission efficiently, and the epidemic may have a recurrence at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 connects to ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
The virus also binds to ECA2-expressed cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus developing genetically during transmission between human beings?
Will she become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or have seasonal recurrences, like flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to search for answers to the questions above and to so many others.
However, regardless of the effort required, we have no choice but not to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
The mutation and adaptation stimulated the co-volution of coronavirus (CoVs) and its hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human coVs (HCOVs) were known to cause a mild disease, such as a common cold.
The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) changed what was thought of the CoVs and revealed how much an HCOV infection can be fatal and devastating.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 highlighted the CoVS again and surprised all with its high transmission and reduced pathogenicity compared to your brother SARS-CoV.
The HPOV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of the HPVs is enormously useful.
Most of the HCoVs originated from the bites, in which they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reserve hosts of some HCVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in human beings.
The investigation of coV host interactions in animals can also provide important information on coV pathogens in human beings.
In this study, we present a general view of the existing information about the seven HCVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and transmission of interest.
An important analysis is that we compare and contrast different HCVs with a perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current disease epidemic by CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for effective transition between hosts and the implications of virus development in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoVs) belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of encapsulated viruses, positive polarity and simple fita RNA.
These viruses that present the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, between RNA viruses were called "CoVs" due to their crown morphology when observed in electronic microscope.
As for the structure, CoVs have un segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
About two thirds of the genome contains two open reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the polyproteins of replication pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins, designated nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific line accessory proteins are also encoded by different CoVs lines.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified in four genres (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV and deltaCoV), including the betaCoV gender containing most of the HCVs and is subdivided into four rows (A, B, C and D).
Philogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as a genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, the CoVs have constantly crossed the barriers to species, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
So far, seven human coVs (HCOVs) are known.
Among them, HCV-229E and HCV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, the acute acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 viruses usually cause mild symptoms such as common cold and/or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe respiratory tract infection in a relatively large number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCV-229E, B814, was isolated from the corsis of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies on HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, both causing autolimiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HPV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating of the present and infected more than 8,000 people, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the epidemic of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 HCV (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the agent responsible for the current epidemic of the 2019 coronary disease (COVID-19), which took more than 3.120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people by 3 March 2020.
The alarm is sounding, and the world needs to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is coming.
All seven HCOVs have zoonotic origin in the bites, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate with the evolutionary origin of all HCVs from the bites, where viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The epidemic of COVID-19 presents enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the rest of the world.
The tracking of the zoonotic origins of the HCoVs provides a structure to understand natural history, the incentive force and the restrictive factors of virus migration for other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the future prevention of viral migration between species.
In this article, we present a general view of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and HCOV pathogens.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that parental HPV viruses are generally non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but they become pathogenic after the transmission of interest to a new host.
We also review the evolution trend of HCV, in which the increase in transmissibility is generally accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the end of the 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of the HPV-229E strain B814 strain from the cortex of patients who contracted common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals, including Peru, camundong, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven HCVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of the HCV in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first HCV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted to growth in WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients infected with HCV-229E had common cold symptoms, including headache, spleen, nausea and throat, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of the cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCOV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in mice brains during lactation.
The clinical characteristics of HCV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCV-229E, which are symptomaticly indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory tract pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
The HCV-229E and the HCV-OC43 are distributed globally, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by the disease for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected by HCV-229E developed a common cold brand.
Only a few immunocompromised patients showed a serious infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCV in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCV.
The first case of SARS dates back to 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, spreading by several countries and continents.
With the exception of the "suppliers", it was estimated that each infected person may contaminate approximately two others, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the appearance of the peak of the viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and calaphry, followed by subsequent symptoms of dyspnoea, cough and respiratory discomfort.
Lymphopenia, hepatic dysfunction and elevated creatinine are the common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased number of macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
About 20% to 30% of patients need at some point intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory tract, several organs, including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, may also be affected in these severe cases, usually with the occurrence of a cytokine cascade, which may be fatal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy from a patient's zero patient traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCOV.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
It was initially discovered that the virus was prevalent in small children, elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The symptoms of corrosive, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is scattered throughout the world.
It was estimated that HCV-NL63 corresponds to approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
The HCV-NL63 is associated with obstructive larynx, also known as crustaceans.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolyte acquired in a Community manner, it was reported that HCV-HKU1 was associated with acute asthma exacerbation.
Just as HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All these four EC-acquired HPVs have adapted well to human beings and are generally less likely to undergo mutations and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HPV-NL63, which has recently been reported as a cause of severe respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these HCVs acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and to maintain themselves continuously in human beings, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While the majority of laboratory confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary distribution for close contacts were reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal impairment, which is therefore very peculiar to MERS, among the diseases caused by HCOV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 34.4 %, which made the MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses of human knowledge.
From half to the end of December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, which were known to be retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the continuous epidemic of infection of the lower respiratory tract caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international importance and also named the disease COVID-19.
By 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed in the world, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 3.4%.
It is noted that the fatality related to cases confirmed in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the fatality outside that city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, the same as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with the presence of fever, cough and dyspnoea.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to 82% high homology in the nucleotide sequence, they group in different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic, but is more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 were reported, and they can contribute to the rapid spread of the virus in the world.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCVs reveal similarities and differences of great relevance.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the evolution of the HCV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCVs.
Secondly, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four HCVs acquired in a Community manner (HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection presents characteristics that are more observed during infection with EC-acquired HCVs, including the presence of non-specific symptoms, brands or until symptoms are absent.
On the other hand, a small subset of serious cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns, both in the EC-COVs and in the SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmissionability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of the HCOVs acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing to human beings, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, in the same way as the other HCVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal samples.
It still needs to be clarified in future studies if the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 gold-fetal plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, in at least some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 can show seasonality, as in the cases of EC-acquired HCVs.
In any case, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after its transition to human beings, will influence the outcome of the current epidemic of COVID-19.
All HCVs acquired by the Community that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to human beings.
From another perspective, it can also be true that human beings have adapted well to these four HCOVs.
In other words, both could be the survivors of old HCoV pandemics.
The HPVs that cause serious diseases in human beings and people who develop serious HPV diseases were eliminated.
In order for this to happen, HCOVs need to replicate themselves in human beings to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralise the restriction factors.
In this sense, the greater the time of survival of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to human beings.
If adaptation is appropriate, its transmission to human beings would be difficult to control with the quarantine or other control measures of infection.
A number of years ago, the four CoVs acquired in a Community way flow into the human population, causing a common cold in individuals with immunosupply.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, highly pathogenic, did not adapt well to human beings, and their transmission between human beings cannot be sustained.
They need to keep and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and take advantage of the chance to migrate to human targetables, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-COV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-COV, MERS-COV and four EC-COVs.
It is highly transmissible, in the same way as the EC acquired HCOVs, at least until now.
However, it is more pathogenic than those acquired in a Community and less pathogenic way than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It still needs to be discovered if it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate among us without a reserve or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of the HCOVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of the HCOVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCOV if it covers an ancestral direct relationship, sharing high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is generally well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reserve host covers the HCOV in a continuous and durable manner.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the HCOV or their parental virus.
On the other hand, if the HCV is reintroduced to an intermediate host immediately before or near its introduction to human beings, it does not adapt adequately to the new host, and it is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of the human infection and perform the function of an amplifier host, allowing the virus to replicate in a transitory way and then transmit it to humans and increase the scale of the human infection.
A HCV may have the infection interrupted if it is unable to sustain its transmission to the intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reserve host.
Epidemiological data revealed that the SARS patient had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent studies of seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG antiSARS-CoV compared to that of the general population.
Masked palm shells (Paguma larvata) and a dog-guaxin in live animal markets were initially identified as virus carriers similar to SARS-CoV.
The identification was indirectly corroborated by the fact that no other SARS was notified after the killing of all civilians in the markets.
However, it was reported that wild or farmed palm shells without exposure to live animal markets were highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm shell shells could only be the amplifying intermediate host, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals on the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that several small mammals may serve as intermediate hosts amplifying SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All these animals seem to be SARS-CoV terminal hosts.
The subsequent search by the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a close-relationship coV, named CoV HKU3 of Morse Rhinolophus related to SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese ferret.
These bites are positive for antiSARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSR-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other CoVs of bites share 88% to 92% homology with SARS-CoV in the nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that the bites are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several CoVs similar to SARS (SL-CoVs) were also identified in pieces, but no CoV, with the exception of designated WIV1, can be isolated as live virus.
It is known that the human angiotensin 2 (ECA2) converting enzyme is the SARS-CoV receptor.
It was demonstrated that WIV1 derived from faecal samples of fragments uses ECA2 of fragments, civets and human beings as a receptor for entry into cells.
It is intriguing that the serum of convalescent patients in SARS was able to neutralize WIV1.
Up to now, WIV1 represents the ancestral with a closer relationship to SARS-CoV in bits, sharing 95% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV, and that the bites are not the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis group the MERS-CoV in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 of bits and the CoV-HKU5 of bits.
The CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidil-peptidase 4 (DPP4), for the virus entry.
The sequences of polymerase of RNA dependent RNA of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to beta-CoV homologues of pieces identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no MERS-CoV live was found in wild bites.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the CoV-HKU25 of the bites, share only 87% of homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, the mortars may not be the immediate reservoir host of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the seropositives are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralization antibodies, in the same way as Middle East camels in several African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in human beings, was isolated from nasal spruces of dreamers, increased the evidence that camels serve as the legitimate MERS-CoV reservoir host.
It is also worth noting that the symptoms usually mild, but with massive virus transmission, were observed in camels infected experimentally with MERS-CoV.
It is notable that infected camels transmit the viruses not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of transmission of viruses in bites.
However, there are still no answers, as many confirmed cases of the MES do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which may be attributed to the transmission between persons or transmission routes involving unidentified animal species covered by the MES-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide homologies with a CoV RatG13 of March, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis.
As in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the difference in the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is very large to attribute a parental relationship.
In other words, bites may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless CoVs almost identical to bites are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that the middle animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be set up among wild species sold and slaughtered in the Huaan Sea Fruit Market, to which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely event of animal transmission to human beings.
Several recent studies based on metagenomial sequencing suggested that a group of small endangered mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also cover betaCoVs ancestral related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new coV genes of pangolim share 85% to 92% homology in the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also, in the same way, directly related to the RATG13, with approximately 90% identity at the level of nucleotide sequence.
They are grouped into viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor-linking domain (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% identity in the amino acid sequence.
In a huge contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 DLRs and RATG13 are more diverse, although they present a high degree of sequential homology across the genome.
A recent study on patients with pangolins also reported the detection of viral sequences of lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of configuration and manual healing to generate a partial genetic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolim is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to confirm the direct origin of the pangoline SARS-CoV-2 due to the difference in the sequence between the SARS-CoV-2 and the betaCoVs related to the SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even lower than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs related to the SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolins.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in the bites, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be clarified.
While the highest sequential homology was found in the DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolim, betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest broad sequential genomic homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between betaCoVs' DLRs of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is reflected in the converging evolution mediated by selectivity.
A different argument is for the recombination between the betaCoV of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and the RATG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As a driving force in evolution, the recombination is quite present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCVs, the zoonotic origin of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 viruses has also been studied.
Philogenetic evidence indicated that both the HCV-NL63 and the HCV-229E could have originated from the coVs of bites, while the parental viruses of the HCV-OC43 and the HCV-HKU1 were discovered in rodents.
It was reported that a CoV of bits called ARCoV.2 (CoV of Appalachian Ridge) detected in the North American tricolor piece had a direct relationship with the HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, the HCOV-229E was genetically related to another CoV of Morsego, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and there is also a suspicion that camels are their intermediate hosts.
For greater clarity, the current knowledge about known animal origins of HCOVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of the HCoVs throughout history.
When the HCV-OC43 crossed the species and infected human beings from domestic animals around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The story of interspecies transmission of the HCV-229E is less clear.
AlphaCoVs of closely related to HCV-229E were discovered.
Among them is an alphaCoV of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroborate the direct transmission of the disease virus to human beings.
First, human beings, but not alpacas, can have contact with the bites in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, human beings have direct contact with the alpacas.
Second, the alphaCoVs of bites related to HCV-229E are different and non-pathogenic in bites, while the alphaCoV of alpacas caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alphaCoV of alpacas was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpacas may not be excluded from human alphaCoV related to HCV-229E.
In fact, mosquitoes are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for human beings, including the virus of anger, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus and the Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bites transmit HCV-229E directly to human beings.
As an alternative, while the alphaCoVs serve as a genetic pool of the HCoV-229E, alpacas and triaders can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the viruses to human beings, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-COV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission of the fragments to the dreamers and the dreamers to the human beings.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV from the pieces is known in its initial identification and was corroborated by subsequent results.
It is obvious that the bites provide a rich pool of viral species for the exchange of interspecies of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, high density colonies, close social interaction and high flight capacity are all favourable conditions for the bites to be the ideal "viral propeller".
On the other hand, the introduction of the MERS-CoV in the roadblocks dates back to the decades.
He is well adapted to these camels, and moved from an intermediate host to a natural and stable reserve host.
MERS-CoV is the cause of a very mild disease and sustains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to human beings is an accident, and human beings remain terminal hosts of the MERS-CoV, since its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of the MERS-CoV, the role of the pangolins, if there is any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, is different.
In particular, the betaCoVs of pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host for betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, similar to civets, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for the inter-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 animals for human beings need to be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, the bites could be the reservoir host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings could share the ecological niche with the bites through the abatement or coal mines.
Secondly, the pangolins could be one of the amplifier intermediate hosts, in which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 would have been reintroduced.
Human beings contract the virus through the slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A research on antibodies produced from domestic and wild animals is needed.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both the bites and the pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus are important in facilitating the CoVs cross the barriers of the species.
First, its relatively high rate of mutation in the replication of the RNA.
Compared to other simple fita RNA viruses, estimated CoVs mutation rates can be considered "moderate" to "highs" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year, on a local basis, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV to new hosts.
CoVs have exorribonuclease with a review mechanism, whose exclusion results in excessively high metabolism and attenuation, or even inviability.
It is interesting that nucleotide analogue remedesivir suppresses coV replication by inhibiting exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remedesivir is one of the most promising antiSARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, CoVs' mutation rates are almost a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is generally high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently low, which suggests its highest level of adaptation to human beings.
Apparently, he has already adapted to another host who keeps in touch with human beings.
In addition to SARS-COV-2, this also applies to MERS-COV, which is well adapted to the drummers.
In theory, a genetic change is unlikely to rapidly render the vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in CoVs exercises an extra plasticity in changing the genome for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the likelihood of inter-species evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of unique reading frames and encoded protein functions in relation to the last three inches of the end of the genome.
Thirdly, CoVs exchange models randomly and frequently during the replication of RNA by means of a single "copy selection" mechanism.
In a host serving as a mixing container, the exchange of tapes occurs frequently during the transcription of the CoV RNA.
Long RNAs highly homologous and subgenomic can be recombined to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43 as well as in animal coVs, such as the SL-CoV of the bites and batCoV-HKU9.
Host virus interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences the interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during inter-species transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between human and civet SARS-CoV isolates, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, mainly with changes in the DLR of the protein S.
In general, the DLR in the protein S of a CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is strongly selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, DLR is in the amino acids 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, which is linked to human ECA2 and its receptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV DLR is able to recognise the ECA2 receptors of several animals, including mosquitoes, civets, mice and guaxin dogs, allowing the inter-species transmission of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid wastes were different from human viral isolates and civets in the DLR, and four of them are located in the origin of the receptor for interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV of the civets has K479N and S487T mutations in their DLR, which could increase the affinity of protein interaction spike with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It should be noted that SARS-COV-2 shares the same cell receptor with SARS-COV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein unit implies that the binding affinity of its S protein with human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study with electronic cryomythroscopy indicates a affinity of 10 to 20 times that of this binding than between human ECA2 and the S-protein of SARS-CoV.
It will also be useful to determine whether any other receiver may be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is intriguing that HCV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different part of the protein S.
There are several other HCV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCV-229E and 9-O-acetylated silica for HCV-OC43.
They could also respond by effectively adapting these CoVs to human beings after transmission of interest to their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of the inter-species transmission of the HPVs is also governed by other control and dependency factors with the host.
The differentiation of these host proteins between the human beings and the natural reserve hosts of the HCOVs such as bats, drums and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
The HCOVs need to absorb the dependency factors with the host and to subvert the host's restriction factors for an effective inter-species transmission.
In this sense, the molecular determinants in this important area of host virus interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
A non-volatile selection with range of the host-dependent genome and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern technology of CRISPR can produce good results.
New HCoVs suction: back to zero stack
The diversity of the CoVs of bits provides broad possibilities for the emergence of new HPVs.
In this sense, the CoVs of bites serve as a genetic pool of the HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also stimulate the evolution of HCV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes has the potential to dramatically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV-accessory proteins, ORF8 is believed to be important in its adaptation to human beings, since the SARS-CoV-related mosquito viruses have been isolated, but it has been discovered that they encode different ORF8 proteins.
A characteristic of the exclusion of nucleotide 29 from SARS-CoVs was discovered in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
The exclusion divides ORF8a into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the alternance of hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombinant with alphaCoVs and gammaCoVs lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent polymerase.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
In the same way, it was demonstrated that the epidemiological MERS-CoV went through recombination events between different lines, which occurred in roadblocks in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recombination events were also observed in other HCVs, in which the HCVs are recombinated with other CoVs of animals in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, which are likely to result from the relief of the virus selection pressure, such as the host's immune system pressure.
An example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the HCV-229E prototype strain due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 may be observed in HPV-229E-related mosquito viruses, the alphaCoV of alpacas presents a simple insertion of nucleotides, resulting in a change in the tables.
Finally, but no less important, the evolution of new HCVs is also driven by the selection pressure in its reservoir hosts.
Absence of symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bites when infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bites.
It is likely that the bites are well adapted to the anatomical and physiological CoVs.
For example, defects in activation of the pro-inflammatory response in the joints effectively reduce the pathology triggered by the CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural extermination cells in the bites is eliminated due to the adaptation of the natural extermination inhibitor NKG2/CD94, and the low degree of expression of Class I molecules of the main histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (EROs) generated by the high metabolic activity of the bites can both suppress the replication of the CoV and affect the revision by exorribonuclease, thus providing selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics to adapt the host.
Therefore, it is not the case that three new HCOVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic, or cause, at most, mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bites and camels.
They reproduce immensely without causing a high immune response from the host.
This document contains explanations of the discovery of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of serious cases of human infection.
Serious symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and the cascade of cytokine, in which the greater the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decomposed from the replication of the CoV.
The same immune response activation strategy could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is specifically strong in bits.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon at the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human beings should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the inflammasom NLRP3 in the joints is weak.
Following this reasoning, the inhibition of the inflammatory NLRP3 with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-COV-2 follows the same principles by which SARS-COV and MERS-COV emerged.
As it was discovered that betaCoV of the bites shares 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a coV of bites that shares 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that civets and other animals in the markets are providing identical viruses to SARS-CoV, the intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 were not identified.
BetaCoVs of pangolins, with high homology with SARS-CoV-2, were discovered, indicating that pangolins can serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or betaCoVs of pangolins can contribute with genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by an accidental or intentional man.
The CoVs returned to world attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of the CoVs in bites and in other animals has dramatically changed our perception of the importance of the zoonotic and animal reserves of the HPVs in transmission among human beings.
Wide-spread evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in the morgue and are transmitted to people through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between human beings and civilians on the markets, the closure of humid markets and the abolition of civilians on those markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from the wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in view of the discovery of multiple betaCoVs of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it should still be clarified in future studies if SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to human beings through the pangolins and other mammals, and the mode of such transmission.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has existed in dreameries for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transport, and they are an essential source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as was done in the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recurrent epidemics of MES, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other control measures of infection.
Since we have not been able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may arise and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the CoVs of bites with zoonotic potential are very different.
There are several possibilities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and recombinate, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to human beings in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 crisis, a better response and preparation plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses exist on the planet a long time ago.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance of migration to another species.
Although the bites present many features that promote the spread of the virus, the chance that people are in contact with bites and other wild species can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to human beings and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep people away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several parts of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if the bites transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangolins, it is important to find out under what circumstances the bites and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to human beings, it should be determined how people come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal has the role of the true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including human beings, bites and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
If it is a bite, pangolim or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical are identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in human beings.
It is necessary to update the criteria for diagnosis of "suspected case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick guidance guide for the diagnosis and treatment of the infection of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide conveys our experience and is a good reference to combating this global pandemic.
However, the disease of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant findings of research and experiences in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guide and provide the most recent diagnostic criteria for "suspect case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Seventh version) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused a outbreak, which is now officially called the 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus is called Coronavirus 2 from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a fast guidance guide published online in Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
He has attracted excellent attention since the publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant findings of research and experiences in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also updated continuously.
For example, the diagnostic and treatment guides of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 have a total of seven editions with substantial changes in some contexts.
Our guide has now received a comment from Zhou et al., who presented a simple score proposal based on his clinical experience.
This work has added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this global pandemic.
We carry out his meaningful work and express our gratitude.
However, its work also needs to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides (Seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm the suspect case, it is necessary to combine one element of epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to perform a comprehensive analysis, or to perform three elements of clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in nearby or other communities where cases of COVID-19 were reported in the last 14 days before symptoms occurred; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nuclear acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and of nearby areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 were reported in the last 14 days before symptoms occurred; (4) a history of contact with a confirmed group of cases (more or equal to two cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small spaces, such as home, office, classroom, classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with diagnostic resources per image of the infection by COVID-19; (3) count of total white blood cells exhibiting normal, decreased or reduced count of lymphocytes in the initial stage of onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with any of the following serological or pathogenic items: (1) positive PCR examination for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full viral genome sequencing exhibiting high homogeneity in relation to the new known coronary viruses; (3) positive for IgM and IgG-specific antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 in serum examination; or any modification of the specific IgG-specific antibody for SARS-CoV-2 negative for positive or titration greater than or equal to four times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase.
We can note that the real-time PCR exam for nucleic acid in blood samples or respiratory tract was added to the second and third edition (from 18 and 22 January 2020, respectively).
The pathogenic blood sample detection was added to the fourth and fifth editions (27 January 2020 and 8 February 2020 respectively), and the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers in the search for an ideal nuclear acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis and samples of respiratory tract, including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and helped to bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is increasingly evidence that reminds us of paying attention to symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. fluxogram should be updated, since the person without clinical symptoms is classified as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be verified in more clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we expect the emergence of more direct evidence and we ask readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspected case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that they verify and follow the latest guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also timely update our guide to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, higher daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 per day.
That's the biggest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
On yesterday's date, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research in Bangladesh (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases remaining at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news release, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were more than 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old, and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said two of the victims were from Daca.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March.
One hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anticorruption Commission, which was treated at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video release, the Bengali Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said that public transport would be paralyzed for longer than originally planned until next Saturday.
This public transport paralysis began on 26 March and was planned to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products (medical, fuel and food) was still permitted.
The first COVID-19 infection incidents in Bangladesh were recorded on 8 March, in two people who returned from Italy and also in the wife of one of them.
On 19 March, the three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeds a million infections in the world
On Thursday, the total number of cases of infections by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus worldwide passed by a million, reported data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronary disease.
This framework came the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronary infections and Zambia had its first virus-related death.
North Korea stated that until Thursday it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronary infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,056,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases at 24 hours before 10 a.m. in Central Europe Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were reported, involving at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, quoting data from the University of Johns Hopkins, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States caused by coronary infections on Wednesday.
Worldwide, countries have announced more stringent measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's total blockade until 1 May.
On a national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to be paid without attending the work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency within 15 days, and the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended to the whole day the duration of the harvest in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina. Previously, this duration was only from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Thailand plans to implement harvest touch from 22h to 4h
Ohio governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay home by 1 May.
Stores in Australia reduce the limits of hygiene paper by transaction
On Saturday and Sunday nights, Australian stores Woolworths and Coles reduced the purchase restrictions of toilet paper, respectively, for two packages and a transaction package in all the stores in the country.
On Monday, ALDI also implemented a package limit.
These limitations were communicated by messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
For fear of COVID-19, buyers were allegedly stockpiling in case there was a need to isolate.
On Thursday, Woolworths also limited the purchases of toilet paper with delivery at home for a package on request.
These changes came after the previous restriction of four packages by transaction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press note of 8 March, reported that, even with the restriction of four packages, "many stores are still exhausting stocks in less than an hour after delivery" and called the demand for "without precedents", while ALDI called it "an unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
The sales had a "enhanced increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco's shop in Camberra also limited the quantity allowed for two packages last week.
To further alleviate the scarcity, Coles ordered larger packages of suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI made premature stock stocks of a planned promotion for Wednesday.
Russel Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Association of Varajists, said that varajists try to increase stocks, but that local board restrictions on the frequency of truck deliveries make it difficult.
It expects high production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and less promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the advance release of the stock, some stores will not be able to carry out the Wednesday promotion.
In a news report from News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a senior specialist at the University of Technology in Queensland, said that stores restock every night.
He highlighted that the hygiene role is a volumey item with low stock numbers in terms of quantity, and that, when exhausted, leaves many empty spaces in the toilets, increasing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the opinion [of] that if there was an abundant quantity in the toilets, if products such as hygienic and antiseptic roles could be [purchased] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce panic, Russel Zimmerman told ABC News.
The recycled health paper manufacturer Who Gives Crap said on the last Thursday that they would be without stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who produces Kleenex's hygiene role, and Solaris Paper, who produces Sorbent, stressed that they were working 24 hours a day 7 days a week to maintain supply, according to News.com.au report.
The real estate site domain.com reported that some real estate sellers were offering free hygienic role to the first auction bidders in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were being held with buyers entering the strike at the end of the extended week of Work Day.
The NT News Thursday edition, a daily Darwin print, included an eight-page insert to be cut and used as a hygiene paper.
Initially, stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also with high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, hand soaps and flour.
As in Australia, on Sunday night, the UK online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of the Andres hygiene paper for two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the coronvirus SARS-COV-2 — is a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemia" indicates only the extent of the spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to drive governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize the population for a response, Tedos Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO said.
We are very concerned about the alarming levels of dissemination and gravity and the alarming levels of lack of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is a pandemic "without precedents".
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that "out of influence, no other respiratory virus was monitored from the onset to the continuous global spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, saying that "we had never seen a pandemic initiated by a coronavirus".
And he went on "and we've never seen a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO's January decision to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said that the outcome, "in sum, will worsen."
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The pandemic of 2019–20 of the coronavirus is a continuous pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus of acute acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, an international public health emergency of international concern was declared on 30 January 2020 and recognised as pandemic on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while overall it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific antiviral vaccine or treatment known.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended prevention measures include washing hands, covering the mouth with toxins, keeping the people away and monitoring and isolation of people with suspected infection.
The authorities around the world responded with the implementation of travel restrictions, forty, pick-up points, risk controls at the workplace and closure of establishments.
The pandemic caused a severe global socio-economic interruption, delay or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread lack of supplies exacerbated by the purchases triggered by panic.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the student population in the world.
The disinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with east and southeastern Asian descent and other people in areas with significant virus cases.
Due to the reduction of travel and the closures of the heavy industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Wuhan's health authorities in China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia due to unknown reasons on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated at the beginning of January 2020.
In most cases, they were linked to the Huanan Sea fruit market, and therefore it is believed that the virus has zoonotic origin.
The outbreak-induced virus is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that has a close connection to the coronavirus of the morgue, pangolim and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms that you have known had a disease on December 1, 2019 and did not have visible connections with the subsequent group of the seafood market.
From the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two thirds had a link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggested that a case was pointed out by 17 November 2019, in an individual of 55 years from Hubei Province, who may have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases reported decreased in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases from China for the first time.
There may be a significant sub-notification of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
Until February 26, relatively few cases had been reported among young people aged 19 or less, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The main scientific consultant of the United Kingdom, Patrick Vallanance, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected until an effective collective immunity could be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of persons who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose tests have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
By 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and several countries adopted official policies not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected in China until 23 January and that these undocumented infections were the source of 79% of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover themselves.
For those who did not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, 14 days being the most common.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, by February 5, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official death count by the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to people who died and who had positive testing for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths by COVID-19 may be much higher, since it may not include people who died without having done the test, for example, who died at home, in homes of rest, etc.
Italy's partial data showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official count of deaths by COVID by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokesperson for the U.S. disease control and prevention centres (CDCs) acknowledged that "we know that [the number of official deaths] is underestimated", a statement corroborated by episodes of sub-notification in the U.S... This sub-estimation often occurs in pandemics such as the H1N1 swine flu epidemic in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths in all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since onset and characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The fatality coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed at a given interval.
Based on the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the overall fatality rate is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) until 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, the fatality rate estimates fell from 17.3% (in people with onset of symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the fatality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the fatality rate of infection (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not static over time and follow a specific population of infection through the resolution of the case.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Medical Center Based on Evidence from Oxford University estimates that the fatality rate of infection for pandemic is generally between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this interval is consistent with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum length of the exit are uncertain and can change according to the location.
Maciej Boni, of the State University of Pennsylvania, stated that, "without due control, infectious epidemics usually reach their height and then enter decline when there are no more hosts available for the disease.
But it is almost impossible to make any proper projection at the moment when this will happen."
The senior Chinese government medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, argued that "may end until June" if all countries mobilize to follow WHO's recommendations regarding measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, declared that SARS-CoV-2 "will probably continue in circulation for a year or two".
According to the study of Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (potentially in 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner, of Vanderbilt University, declared: "It is unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely, since it is highly transmissible" and "that it may become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The virulence of reappearance will depend on group immunity and the extent of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively inspecific and the infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secretion production (catarro), loss of olfactory sensation, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, calaphrys, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO says that about one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) List that emergency symptoms are the difficulty in breathing, pain or pressure in the persistent chest, sudden confusion, difficulty in walking and face or lips with blue coloring. It is advised to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. The evolution of the disease may cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, because, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without clinical symptoms, but with results from tests that confirm the infection, the researchers recommend that those who were in close contact with a person with confirmed infection be monitored and examined closely to discard the infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from some to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between the beginning of infection and the symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but usually is five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost the olfactory sensation was initially 30% and then fell to 15%.
Some details on how the disease spread are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is mainly spread by close contact and small gothics produced during the act of tossing, sneezing or talking, and the next contact is considered to be 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that brushing without covering the mouth can make the gothics reach 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by gothices that remain for longer periods in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Respiratory gothics can also be produced during expiry, including speaking, although the virus is not normally suspended.
Gastrointestinals can be put in the mouth and noses of people nearby or possibly inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause nebulization of respiratory secretions, resulting in air propagation.
The spread can also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches in his own eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there is concern that it can spread through the faeces, it is believed that the risk of this happening is low.
The government of China has denied the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 gold-fetal. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of the symptoms, although transmission may be possible before the symptoms occur and at subsequent stages of the disease.
There were positive tests for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that transmission is possible even before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission was identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that, although it is not entirely clear the ease with which the disease spreads, a person usually infected from two to three other people.
In particular, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, for one day in paper and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have already tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus to humans. However, the British authorities advise to wash their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Coronavirus 2 from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, isolated for the first time from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are similar to those of coronavirus related in its nature. Outside of the human body, the virus dies by home soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is intimately associated with the original SARS-COV.
It's believed to have zoonotic origin.
The genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, subgener Sarbecovirus (line B). Two strains of this same line are derived from bits.
It has 96% similarity across the genome to other samples of coronavirus coming from bites (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid of difference in certain parts of the gene sequences between the pangolins virus and that of humans.
The comparison of the entire genome so far has found at most 92% of the genetic material sharing between the pangolim coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
The virus infection may be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms. However, the definitive confirmation is due to the reverse transcription followed by a reaction in the polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or computerized tomography (TC).
A study conducted in Wuhan, comparing rRT-PCR to TC suggested that TC is significantly more sensitive, although less specific, with many of its image characteristics matching other pneumonias and pathological processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "the TC is not used for screening or as a front line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".
WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by reaction and polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test may be performed in respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually available for a few hours a day.
Usually, this test is carried out in a nasopharyngeal squeezing, although the throat squeezing is also used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, capable of detecting antibodies.
At the date of 6 April 2020, none of them had proved necessary enough to be approved for generalised use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States was approved to be used in emergency mode only by certified laboratories.
The particularities of the images of computerized radiographics and tomography (TC) of symptomatic individuals include asymmetric asymmetry and absence of pleural spills.
The Italian Radiological Society is collecting an online international database of image results in confirmed cases.
Due to the overposition with other infections such as adenovirus, images without PCR confirmation are limited in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT to PCR and demonstrated that, although the image is less specific to the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, which suggests its consideration as an investigation tool in epidemiological areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the characteristics of virus images with radiographics and with TC.
Strategies to avoid transmission of the disease include keeping a good personal hygiene in general, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands, tossing or blowing on a paper sheet and putting this sheet directly into a waste container.
It is advised who has already been infected to use a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to avoid transmission. Many governments have restricted or unadvised non-essential journeys going to or from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of Community proliferation in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some members of the community do not know where or how they were infected. It is recommended that health professionals take care of individuals who may be infected to use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent subsequent transmission.
The use by the localization data governments from cell phones for this purpose has raised issues of privacy, with Anistia International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement requesting limitations on this kind of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use. On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to register the proximity of a user to other mobile phones.
The users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for the COVID-19. Some wrong concepts about how to prevent infection have circulated, such as nailing the nose and gagging with collatures, which has already proved ineffective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19. However, several organizations are working for the development of one.
Washing hands is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when the hands are clearly dirty. You also have to wash your hands before and after brushing the nose, cough or breathe.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soap, which breaks its protective layer.
The CDC still recommends the use of alcohol-based hand hygiene with a minimum volume of 60% of alcohol, when there is no soap and water readily available.
WHO advises to avoid touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
The surfaces may be decontaminated with various solutions (up to a minute of exposure to the disinfectant to an stainless steel surface), including ethanol to 62-71%, isopropyl alcohol to 50-100%, sodium hypochlorite to 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide to 0.5% and iodopovidone to 0.2-7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and clorexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that in case of suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 at a site, such as an office or a creche, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, electronic equipment shared as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and electronic boxes used by patients should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with the folded elbow or with a paper sheet on tossing or sneezing, as well as immediately discarding any sheet.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as using a mask may limit the volume and distance of displacement of expiratory droplets when speaking, breathing or coughing.
WHO published instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "The use of masks can reduce the propensity of people to touch their faces, which is one of the greatest sources of infection without the proper hygiene of their hands." The use of masks by caregivers of people who may have the disease has also been recommended.
WHO recommended the use of masks for healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that using masks can help people not to touch their own face.
In several countries, the use of masks for the face of the public in general has begun to be encouraged.
In the US, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical mask for the face made of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of medical masks that can be disposed of by healthy people in general, especially when entering close contact with another person (being 1 meter or less away).
In Hong Kong, the use of surgical mask is recommended when using public transport or while staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make facial clothing masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is prohibited to go out in public without using a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to use a facial mask when going out in public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government demanded that everyone entering supermarkets should use a mask for the face.
In Israel, all residents were asked to use masks for the face in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, demanded that passengers on intermunicipal trains and buses use masks for the face as from 1 April.
In Panama, the use of mask for face when going out the street is mandatory. At the same time, the production of masks at home was recommended for those who could not buy.
Masks for the face have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) involves infection control actions aimed at accelerating the transmission of the disease, by reducing the close contact between individuals.
The methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shopping centers.
Social distance methods can be applied by everyone while staying at home, limiting their travels, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings and keeping away from others.
At the moment, many governments are forcing or recommending social distance in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by the U.S. government bodies and health organizations was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if no COVID-19 transmission knowledge is available in one region) to 50 people and then 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems face greater risk of serious diseases and complications, being advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas of the Community epidemic. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term "social distance" by "physical distance", to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social connections, whether virtual or distance.
The use of the term "social distance" led to the implications that social isolation was necessary entirely instead of encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities published sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with, that does not have virus or symptoms.
Self-insulation at home was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for adequate self-insulation. Many governments have demanded or recommended auto quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive self-quantence instructions were issued to those in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with a wide range of transmissions that take 14 days of self-quantenna since the last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling a leak are the retention or suppression and reduction.
Containment is carried out in the preliminary stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as to present other measures to control the infection and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When containing the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to reduce: the measures taken now serve to reduce the rate of spread and to reduce its adverse effects on the health system, as well as on the population.
Containment and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time, in combination.
The suppression requires more extreme measures in order to reverse the pandemic to a basic reproductive rate less than 1. The management of an outbreak of infectious disease, in part, has to do with trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic.
Thus, the risk of overload of health services is reduced, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Interventions that are not pharmaceutical and that may administer the outcome include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, the use of masks for face and self-quate; Community measures aimed at physical distance, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of events that lead to agglomerations; Community involvement, in order to stimulate acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures such as cleaning of contact surfaces.
Other countries have taken different measures to ensure that the spread of the virus is limited.
South Korea, for example, presented the mass screening and the quarantines located. In addition, the government issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, the infected received financial support when carrying out the autoquantine and, for those who did not do so, severe fines were imposed.
In Taiwan, there was an increase in the production of masks for the face and those who stored medical supplies were punished. Simulations carried out in the United Kingdom and in the United States show that the reduction (the reduction in the rate of contagion, without stopping the spread of the epidemic) and the suppression (i.e. the reversal of the growth of the epidemic) present major challenges.
Ideal reduction policies can reduce demand for health services by 2/3 and death by half. Still, this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, overloading health systems at the same time.
The suppression may be the best alternative, but it needs to be maintained as long as there is a virus circulation by the human population or even the availability of a vaccine, if that happens before. On the contrary, the transmission again occurs so soon the relaxation of the measures takes place.
A long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic brings with it social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral medicine that is specific to COVID-19. However, there are efforts to develop medicines, which include the existing drug test.
The use of medicines for refrigerating that do not require medical prescription, drink quite liquid and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, the use of oxygen therapy, intravenous insertion of liquids or respiratory aid may be necessary.
The use of steroids may worsen the condition.
Various compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has also stated that some "home and traditional" medicines can alleviate the symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus.
WHO describes the increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs brought by COVID-19 as fundamental measures to combat the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the WHO office in Europe have issued guidelines for primary health care hospitals and services to move their resources at various levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for the testing of COVID-19, the cancellation of non-compulsory procedures and the separation and isolation of patients with positive testing for COVID-19, as well as the increased capacity of intensive care through personnel training and the increase in the number of beds and fans available.
There are different theories about the occurrence of the first case (the so-called zero patient).
The first case known as the new crownvirus date 1 December 2019, in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in the region increased gradually.
These cases were largely linked to the Huaan Sea fruit market. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus was from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a group of patients was observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei's Provincial Hospital. On the following day, the doctor informed Wuhan Jianghan's Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan's Central Hospital alerted their colleagues about a SARS-type coronavirus.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were convicted by the police for spreading false news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was accused by his superiors for having given the alarm.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made a communication to the population and informed WHO.
Cases of unknown source pneumonia had already been reported to the health authorities of Wuhan to generate an investigation at the beginning of January. During the first stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days, approximately.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread across other provinces of China, facilitated by the migration of the new Chinese year and by Wuhan's being a transport centre, as well as a major railway connection point.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Further official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy, with the largest number of cases confirmed in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have already had at least one case.
On the basis of the pandemic in Europe, many countries that are part of the Schengen Treaty have restricted free movement and established border controls.
The country's reactions included detention measures, such as quarantine (also known as home restraint orders, home detention orders, or lockdown) and pickups. On 2 April, about 300 million people (almost 90% of the population) are somehow confined in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined to the Philippines, around 59 million people are confined to South Africa and 1.3 billion people are confined to India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were already in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Wuhan on 1 December 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests an earlier case of 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown causes on December 26th. His hospital informed Wuhan Jianghan's Centre for Disease Prevention and Control on December 27th.
Initial genetic tests, on 27 December 2019, in samples withdrawn from patients indicated the presence of a coronavirus type SARS.
A communication to the population was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
When these notifications occurred, Wuhan's doctors were warned by the police to "blow rumors" about the outcome.
The National Health Commission of China, initially, claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of transmission between human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "war of the people", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the largest quarantine of mankind's history", a sanitary cord was announced on January 23 to interrupt trips from or back to Wuhan, which was extended by 15 cities in Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The commemorations of the new Chinese year, on 25 January, were cancelled in various locations.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was later built to care for more patients.
Along with the newly built hospitals, China converted 14 other Wuhan facilities into temporary hospitals, such as convention and stadium centers. On 26 January, the government launched more measures to contain the outflow of COVID-19, including the issuance of health statements for travellers and the expansion of the spring festival holiday.
Universities and schools in the whole country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have taken various measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures were taken in many regions of the country.
Travel restrictions were made in Hubei and outside of it.
Public transport was modified, and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
The control of the movement of the public was applied in several cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) went through some kind of restriction of exits. After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to avoid the "importation" of viruses from other countries.
For example, Pequim imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers arriving in the city. On 23 March, mainland China had only one case of domestic transmission within five days, in that case, through a traveler who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, the Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestic transmission cases had been essentially blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. China's Minister of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that the entry of individuals with visa or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March, without specific details about when this policy will be closed.
Anyone wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on March 30, giving package of financial incentives to companies. The State Council declared a day of mourning, beginning with a three-minute silence throughout the country on April 4 at 10 a.m., meeting with the Qingming Festival. The central government, however, asked families to pay their pay online, observing the physical distance to avoid a new appearance of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The national health agency of the country reported a significant increase in cases confirmed on February 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus of Shincheonji.
It is suspected that Shincheonji's devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the exit.
On 22 February, among the 9,336 church followers, 1,261, or about 13% of them, reported having symptoms. South Korea declared maximum alert level on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, reaching 3.150 on 29 February.
All the military bases of South Korea were placed in quarantine after tests confirm that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The timetable of the air lines was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the largest and most well-organized program of the world in terms of population screening for the virus. The country also isolated infected people and traced and placed in quarantine those who came in contact with them.
The screening methods included the individual mandatory report of symptoms for those arriving from international travel through a mobile application, drive-thru virus test, with results available on the following day, as well as increased testing capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
South Korea's programme is considered a success in the control of the outbreak, although it has not placed entire cities in quarantine. South Korean society was initially divided into the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans signed petitions requesting Moon's impeachment under the allegations of bad government management of the outbreak, or raising its response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases lower in four weeks.
On 29 March it was announced that from 1 April all new arrivals coming from outside should enter quarantine for two weeks.
Through media reports on 1 April, South Korea received requests for help with virus testing from 121 different countries.
Iran confirmed its first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on 19 February in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sports events, and religious events on Fridays, the closing of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran had five trillion Rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that he had no plans for the quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be placed in quarantine.
Plans to limit travel between the cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic between the cities before the New Year was continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China during February.
In the form of allegations of the extension of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries traced their cases related to Iran on 28 February indicating that the extension of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government until that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members with a positive test for the virus on 3 March.
On 12 March, the Human Rights Watch strongly requested the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders arrested for peaceful dissidentism, and to temporarily release all prisoners eligible.
The body stated that there is a greater risk of virus spread in closed institutions as detention centres, which also suffer from the lack of medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths on a single day, the largest number since the outbreak in the country.
At least 12 active or retired politicians and government officials died as a result of the disease until 17 March.
By March 23, Iran had 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to Coronavirus.
According to a WHO representative, there should be five more cases in Iran than is being reported.
It is suggested that US sanctions imposed on Iran may be affecting the country's financial ability to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights has requested that economic sanctions be relieved to the nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The exit was confirmed as having spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to increase sharply, which led the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare state of emergency.
A group not associated with the cases of COVID-19 was subsequently detected, starting with 16 cases confirmed in Lombardia on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree to contain the issue, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the emerging areas, the entries and exits of people are prohibited.
The suspension of work activities and sports events had already been determined in these areas. "On 4 March, the Italian government applied for the total closure of all schools and universities throughout the country when Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sports events, including series A football matches, had to be held at doors closed by April, but on March 9, all sports events were suspended completely for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte applied for the closure of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations of medical ethics regarding the screening protocols that could be used.
On 19 March, Italy passed to China as the country with more deaths related to Coronavirus in the world after reporting 3,405 deaths related to pandemic.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia sent nine military aircraft with medical supplies to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with most of these cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all who had the virus until then may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first emerged as one of the most affected countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British government had imposed no social distance or quarantine measures in mass to its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticisms for the acknowledged lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement recommending the interruption of all non-essential and social travel, suggesting that people work at home as much as possible and avoid places like bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure facilities, such as pubs and academies, should be closed as quickly as possible, and committed to paying 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of 2,500 pounds per month to avoid unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more severe social distance measures, preventing agglomerations with more than two people and restricting travel and activities to the minimum necessary.
Different from the previous measures, these restrictions were reinforced by the police through the issue of fines and the dispersion of agglomerations.
Most of the business received orders to close, with exceptions for business considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, railway stores, gas stations and car office.

On 28 January 2020, the Center for Disease Control — the leading public health institute of the U.S. government — announced that they had developed their own testing kit.
Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start for the tests, which concealed the true extent of the outbreak at that time.
The test was marked by test kits with defects produced by the federal government in February, a lack of approval of the federal government for test kits that were not from the government (from academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people who would be tested until the beginning of March (a medical request was subsequently required).

A general approval of the crisis management by Trump was polarized along party lines.
Some U.S. officials and commentators criticised the United States' confidence in the import of essential materials, including essential medical supplies, from China.
An analysis of air travel patterns was used to map and predict spread patterns and was published in The Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
Based on 2018 information from the International Air Transport Association, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei, the largest volume of passengers leaving Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also reported as popular destinations for people who traveled from Wuhan.
Bali was reported as least able among the 20 most popular destinations in terms of preparation, while cities in Australia were considered the most capable. Australia authorized its Emergency Response Plan for the New Coronavirus (COVID-19) on 7 February.
She stated that she was still much to be discovered about COVID-19, and that Australia would emphasize border control and communication in its response to the pandemic.
On 21 March, an emergency of human biosecurity was declared in Australia.

On the other hand, China's aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
WHO observed the contrast between the outbreak of SARS 2002-2004, where the Chinese authorities were accused of neglecting data that made prevention and detention efforts difficult, and the current crisis, where the central government "provided regular updates to avoid the panic of the celebrations in the new month's year".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the main authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea observed that "that was certainly not a WHO recommendation" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated". On 30 January, after confirming the transmission between humans outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak as the International Health Emergency (PHEIC), the sixth PEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO's Director General, Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was invoked because of the "risk of global dissemination, especially in low- and medium-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that unduly interfered with international and trade travel" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and displacements."
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to finance strategic preparation in low- and middle-income countries, citing the urgency to assist these countries that "do not have systems in place to detect people who have contracted the virus, and even if it occurs".
Tedros made subsequent statements indicating that "we are as strong as our weakest link" and asked the international community to "invest now or they will have to pay later". On 11 February, WHO at a press conference established COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to provide the "power of the entire United Nations system as a response".
The United Nations Crisis Management Team was activated as a result, allowing the coordination of the entire response of the United Nations, which WHO declares will allow them to "focus on the health response while other agencies can enter their experience in the social, economic and development implications resulting from the outbreak".
On 14 February, a Joint WHO Mission Team with China was enabled to provide international and non-governmental experts in China with assistance in home management and to evaluate "the severity and transmission of the disease" through workshops and meetings with the main national institutions and to carry out field visits to evaluate "the impact of response activities at provincial and municipal levels, including urban and rural panoramas". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare itself for a possible pandemic of Coronavirus", stating that although it was too early to declare a pandemic, countries should also establish "a preparatory phase".
In response to a development outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the assessment of the global threat of Coronavirus would be high from "high" to "very high", is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergency program, warned in a statement that "This is a statement of reality for every government on the planet: Agree.
This virus can be on its way and you need to be ready," insisting that the correct response measures could help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan also stated that the current data did not allow public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a statement would mean that "we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, WHO declared Coronavirus a pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "deeply concerned about alarming levels of dissemination and gravity, and about alarming levels of inaction". WHO faced many criticisms as an inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The response included a request to the Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom, to submit his resignation, signed by 733 thousand people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, tens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone has the right to intervene to save life and that the government is responsible.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health plan should never serve as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
Experts pointed out that each individual has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, minorities, the elderly, people with mental problems, the unemployed, those living in extreme poverty, people trapped, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups who need government help.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on political responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to address the effects of bordering and restrictions on travel, the digital centre includes a Country Policy Tracer, which helps countries learn among themselves and facilitate a coordinated global response to the Coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, by the United Kingdom Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and by the son of the president of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro by the management of the pandemic, which started in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Administrators at the province level of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed due to their approach to the efforts related to the quarantine in China Central, a sign of discontent to the response of the political establishment to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from public wrath regarding the outbreak of Coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected an early recognition of the outbreak of Coronavirus that began in Wuhan, favoring theories of the conspiracy on the COVID-19 originating in the USA or Italy.
The administration of the United States of Donald Trump referred to the Coronavirus as the "Chinese Vírus" or "Wuhan Vírus" saying that China's censorship "supplied a virus that now became a global pandemic", which was condemned by some critics such as racism and "a way of diverting the maladministration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast has achieved a detailed communication strategy with apparent origins in the National Security Council, with a strategy being quoted as "That all has to do with China.
It was advised that we should try and get these messages in any way, including press conferences and television shows. "Canals such as Politician, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg indicated that China's efforts to send assistance to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda for a global influence.
The European Union's foreign policy leader, Josep Borrell, warned that there is "a geopolitical component including an influence struggle through a trendy and 'genuity policies' point of view.
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively spreading the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also requested the United States to suspend its sanctions to Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while allegedly sending assistance to those same countries.
Jack Ma's 100,000 mask donation to Cuba was blocked by United States sanctions on 3 April.
The United States authorities were also accused of diverting aid from other nations to their own country.
And hear disputes related to masks related to other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has confiscated hundreds of fans for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian government criticised the lack of solidarity between the European Union and those affected by the Coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, the ambassador of Italy to the European Union, said that "Only China replied bilaterally.
Surely this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military army to send military doctors, special disinfectants, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" that 80 percent of Russia's supplies were "useless or of little use for Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on an offensive "geopolitical and diplomatic".
The president of the Lombardia region, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Maio, delivered the media's reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that "to offer help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are at a good stage, they would also act reciprocally if necessary."
NATO military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be maintained on a reduced scale.
The Secretary-General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticised the 2020 defence exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this puts lives at risk not only of the US troops and the various European countries that are participating, but of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate."The Iranian government was strongly affected by the virus, with about a dozen members of the infected parliament, as well as fifteen political or ex-political figures.
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying that his country is having difficulty fighting the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak led the United States to adopt common social policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts predict that this may negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-electing as president in the 2020 elections. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticised the ambiguity and passive efforts of 40th of Japan, after Japan announces that any person coming from South Korea would be placed in a forty-two-week place designated by the government.
South Korean society was initially polarized on the response of President Moon Jae-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions asking for Moon's impeachment in relation to whom they called inadequate management of the event, or praising their response. The pandemic allowed countries to pass emergency laws as an answer.
Some commentators expressed concerns that this could allow governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those considered to have spread false news about the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
Coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several cases of shortage of supplies, due to the increased use of equipment in a global way to combat outbreaks, panic-induced purchases, and disruption of operations in factories and logistics.
Food and Administration of the United States has issued notices on the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and interruptions of the supplier.
Several locals also experienced the event of shopping motivated by panic, which led to empty dishes of essential products such as food, hygiene paper, bottled water, including a shortage of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has warned about delays in sending electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment increased 100 times.
This demand led to an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, with WHO's warning that this would put workers' health at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of formulas for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in the north of Italy and Wuhan region, and the resulting high demand for food, both areas were deprived of an acute lack of food.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been successful, avoiding the shortage of acute food that has been foreseen in Europe and North America.
The North of Italy with its significant agricultural production did not observe a large reduction, but prices may increase according to industry representatives.
Empty food dishes were found only temporarily, even in Wuhan city, and Chinese government officials released pig meat reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to keep reservations for such emergencies.
A damage to the global economy was felt in China: according to a report from the media on 16 March, the economy in China was very affected in the first two months of 2020 due to the government's measures to shorten the spread of the virus, and sales in the market dropped 20.5%.
As mainland China is a large economy and manufacturing centre, the viral outflow was seen as a major threat destabilizing the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the intelligence unit of The Economist predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer image emerges on possible results.
In January 2020, some analysts believed that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed the outbreak of the SARS 2002-2004.
An estimate of a specialist at the University of Washington in St. Louis indicated a $300 billion impact on the world supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) allegedly 'confused' after a decline accentuated in oil prices due to a low demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside Continental China.
On 27 February, due to the growing concerns about the occurrence of Coronavirus, several indices of the US stock exchange including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the average of the Dow Jones industry showed their more expressive fall since 2008, with the Dow drop in 1.191 points, the largest drop in one day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All the other three indexes ended the week with a lower than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH claimed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative perspective.
The actions again fell on the basis of the concerns with the coronavirus, the largest drop on 16 March.
Many consider a likely economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency measures in good time of the central states and banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the financial collapse of 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closing public places including tourist points, and the recommendation of governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Quantas, while the British regional Flybe airline crashed.
The impact in the cruise sector was of a level never seen.
Several train stations and balsa ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a large travel station associated with the New Year's Chinese holiday.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's annual festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many events of the New Year Lunar and tourist attractions were closed to avoid mass agglomerations, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple events.
In 24 of the 31 provinces of China, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday to 10 February, instructing most of the workplaces not to be reopened until this date.
These regions accounted for 80% of GDP in the country and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has increased its response to infectious disease to the highest level and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and canceling its New Year's celebrations. The retail sector has been affected globally, with reductions in store schedules or temporary closures.
Visits to resellers in Europe and Latin America fell 40%.
The North American and Middle East resellers observed a drop of 50-60%.
This also resulted in a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to malls in March compared to February.
Shopping Centers worldwide imposed additional measures, such as greater cleaning, the installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of buyers, and the cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would happen in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's 300 million migrant rural workers were abandoned at home in the provinces of the interior or in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and asked for government support.
The issue of Coronavirus could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The restriction in India left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid by daily pay) unemployed. An Angus Reid Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian families went through some kind of unemployment. Almost 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the country adopted the restriction in mid-March 2020.
During the second 50th of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment assistance and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit programme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany placed their workers under reduced-time work programmes supported by the government known as Kurzabeit.
The German reduced-time remuneration programme was adopted by France and Britain.
The peripheral art and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of the organizations, as well as the people - both employed and independent - worldwide.
The arts and culture sector organizations have tried to maintain their mission (many times publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, to maintain the safety of their employees and the public and to help artists as soon as possible.
In March 2020, around the world and at various levels, museums, libraries, performance sites, and other cultural institutions were permanently closed with their cancelled or delayed exhibitions, events and performances.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and high-accelerating impact of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sports events, and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion events.
The film sector also experienced a interruption. The Vatican announced that the rites of the Holy Week in Rome, which would take place during the last week of the Christian Quarresma period, had been canceled.
Many dioceses recommended that elderly Christians stay at home to participate in the Sunday Mass; some churches provided the services of the church via radio, streaming live online or through television while others offer drive-in style cults.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese closing its churches and chapels and the square of St. Peter empty without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled the services and limited public agglomerations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurus.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and sanctuaries were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims, as well as its residents in sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant interruption in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most of the main events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-2020, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The event interfered with the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "regenerated to a date after 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021". Casinos and other venues of games around the world were closed and presenceal poker tournaments were also delayed or cancelled.
This led many players to play online, with various online games sites reporting significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, with several music groups suspending or canceling their tournaments.
Many big theaters like Broadway's also canceled all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live presentations, such as live live broadcast shows or creating "festivals" online for artists to present, share and disseminate their work.
On-line, several memes on the internet on the coronavirus are spread, as many seek humor and entertainment in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the emergence of COVID-19, there has been an increase in preconception, xenophobia and racism aimed at people of Chinese or East Asian descent, and against people of the focus areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, distrust, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
February results (when most of the cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people to deserve the virus or to be receiving a just punishment for what they caused.
Some countries in Africa also identified an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many people in Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is addressed to those in areas affected by the virus.
After the rise in new focus countries, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outflow of COVID-19 could also be subject to distrust and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions pressuring the ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an attempt to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan went to the Trending Topics of Twitter.
The Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, reported increasing levels of racist insults as well as attacks.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, was the target of criticism because he referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term considered by the critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine demonstrators attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and aliens evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, bordering China, and students in large cities in India allegedly suffered persecution related to the emergence of coronavirus.
The president of the unit in the state of Bharatiya Janata Party in Western Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and "that is why God turned against them".
The comments were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, who called it "inequitable". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were inspired by the pandemic, with foreigners called "foreign trash" and targets of "disposal".
Many newspapers with payment access removed them from some or all of the coverage on the crownvirus.
Several scientific editors have made available scientific articles related to the exit with open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their conclusions as early as possible on preprint servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory analyses for the respiratory disease of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and only developed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (sorology) can be used for population diagnosis and monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were very mild to be reported or who were asymptomatic.
A precise rate of mortality of the disease and the level of immunity of the herd in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were considerable variations in the number of tests carried out in the countries.
This variability is likely to still substantially affect the mortality rates of the recorded cases, which can be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), the test may be performed in respiratory samples obtained by different methods, including nasopharyngitis or saliva sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours or in 2 days.
The RT-PCR test carried out with a pharynx fracture is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material may be removed from the bottom of the respiratory pathways by suction catheter or material exploding (secretion) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using the polymerase chain reaction with reverse real-time transcription (rRT-PCR), and serves as a base for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive the approval for the emergency use of the National Medical Products Administration of China for the SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its innovative panel diagnosis for the Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) of RT-PCR in real time for public health laboratories by the International Regent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of test kits generated inconclusive tests based on failure reagents, and an obstacle to testing in the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout the month of February 2020.
The tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only then were the local and state laboratories allowed to initiate the tests.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authorisation. Commercial laboratories started testing at the beginning of March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the test for COVID-19 based on RT-PCR.
This Diagnostics also made the tests for COVID-19 nationally available as from 9 March 2020.
No quantity restriction has been announced; the collection and processing of samples shall be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Centre in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Care Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic claimed to have developed a test to detect the infection by COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received an FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours on a wide scale, allowing a machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorisation (U.S.) for the Abbott laboratories for a test in Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorisation for Hologic, LabCorp, and the Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received an FDA US for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test using the isothermic nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of temperature-altered cycles, this method can generate positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the US and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses a monoclonal antibody and the binding in particular to the nucleocapside protein (protein N) of the new coronary virus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of delivering results in 15 to 20 minutes as a rapid flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "Torax radiographics have a lower diagnostic value in the initial stages, while TC findings, computerized tomography, may be present even before symptoms occur".
Typical TC features include multilobe multilobe opaques in dark glass with a posterior, peripheral and asymmetric distribution.
Subpleural domination, mosaic flooring and consolidation evolve according to advanced disease.
A study comparing PCR to TC in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that TC is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, with many of its aspects of image matching with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19". Since March 2020, the CDC recommends the PCR for an initial check.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals started 7 days ago or shortly after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and to monitor the population. The tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLTs) or through remote laboratory tests (PCTs).
The automated systems of high productivity in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the collection stage is not necessary before the test. On 26 March 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that notified the agency, as required, and from now on are able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA with an emergency authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies for the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is of several hundred samples in question of hours and therefore much faster than conventional PCR tests of viral RNA.
The antibodies are normally detected 14 days after the beginning of the infection. At the beginning of April, the United Kingdom considered that none of the test kits of acquired antibodies were adequate enough to be used.
Hong Kong has organized a system in which the suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient", they must expel the saliva into the tube, send it back and get a result soon afterwards. British NHS has announced that it is coordinating a system to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient to infect others if they go to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if any is used. In the drive-thru tests for COVID-19 in suspected cases, a health professional collects samples taking appropriate precautions.
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea carry out some of the fastest and most extensive tests in a country. In Germany, the National Association of Health Health Insurance Statutory Medicine stated on 2 March that it had capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient care, and 10 700 had been tested last week.
The costs are the responsibility of health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity for 160 thousand tests per week.
Since 19 March, drive-in tests have been offered in several large cities.
Since 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany remains unknown, since only positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that from the 12th week of 2020 a total of, at least, 483.295 samples were tested up to the 12th week of 2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, collecting the samples and performing additional tests only if the combined sample was considered positive. In Wuhan, an improvised laboratory of 2000 m2 for emergency detection called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: ↔, or "Fire Eye" in English) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction supervised by the founder of the BGI, Wang Jian, and taking 5 days, the modeling revealed that cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to deal with the quarantine would have doubled if this testing capacity had no online access.
Wuhan laboratory was quickly followed by Hua-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily income was 50 thousand tests per day. Multiple open-source models released by Origami Assays were launched as able to test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19, using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be run in small laboratories without the need of robotic manipulators for liquids.
In March, the lack or insufficient amount of reagent became a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to study the preparation protocols of samples involving the heating of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes for additional tests. On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates are now making more testing per capita to the Coronavirus population than other countries, and would be the way to increase the level of testing and reach most of the population.
This was due to a combination of the drive-thru capacity, and the acquisition of a mass-processing laboratory of the Group 42 and the BGI (inspired by their emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world of this scale to operate outside China.
Various test methods aimed at different components of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted Germany's method for the manufacture of low-income kits that do not have resources to develop their own.
The German method was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Centre was not available until 28 January, there was a delay in the tests available for the US and for China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of test kits well at the beginning of the outbreak, and in addition, these countries with Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and testing recommendations made by health professionals.
On the other hand, experts say that the wide availability of South Korea for testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The test capacity, largely in the private sector laboratories, has been consolidated over many years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization indicated the strengthening of the testing programmes as the best way to delay the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for tests due to the wide spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the supply of cotton and chemical reagents was affected.
In March 2020, China reported accurately problems in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC presented "failures"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the particular tests. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the results inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results could result from a failure to collect samples or from incorrect use of the kits.
Spain's Minister said he would cancel the wrong results kits and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China produced wrong results. Slovakia acquired 1.2 million Chinese test kits considered inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they would be discarded in the Danube. Attes Kara of the Ministry of Health of Turkey said that Turkey's test kits purchased from China had a "high error rate" and that they would not "use them". The United Kingdom acquired 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 announced that they were not useful.
The test, followed by the forty of those who tested positive and the monitoring of those with whom the positive people for SARS-CoV-2 had contact, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vó, the site of the first death by COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two testing stages of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with a range of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases discovered were placed in quarantine.
With the transfer to the restricted municipality, this completely eliminated new infections.
With aggressive contact monitoring, country travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, the Pandemy of Coronavirus in 2020 in Singapore has progressed much slower than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as mandatory closure of restaurants and sales facilities.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to seriously advise the inhabitants to stay home on 28 March, but the schools reopened within the planned holiday on 23 March.
Many other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study identified that the countries that conducted more tests in relation to the number of deaths had more lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect those with no or less symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 are in North America and 1 are in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positivity in % of tests" is influenced by country testing policy.
A country that tests only hospitalized people will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they present or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Hand washing (or hand cleaning), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
The washing of hands with soap constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by gold-feal route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap are important include: before and after the defect, after cleaning the baby's pump or changing flakes, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing the food or handling meat, cheese or raw fish.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be treated with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends the hygiene of hands:
Before, during and after preparing the food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing flakes or cleaning up a child who has used the bathroom.
After touching the nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, rations or animal waste.
The clinical hygiene of the hands refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or medical care may prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main goal of washing hands is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacterials, viruses, or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals that may cause damage or diseases.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many benefits for health, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronary disease and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reducing the rate of infant mortality in births at home.
A 2013 study revealed that better hand-washing practices can lead to small improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhoea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simple introduction of behavioural changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple attitude can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhoea episodes in about a third, which is comparable to providing clean water for missing areas.
48% of the decreases in diarrhoea episodes can be associated with the washing of hands with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and economic way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (IRAs), such as automatic behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the main IRA, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, taking the life of estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhoea and joint pneumonia are responsible for nearly 3.5 million deaths of children annually.
According to UNICEF, changing the washing of hands with soap before eating and after using the bathrobe in an inhaled habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing diarrhoea deaths by nearly half and acute respiratory infections in a room.
Hand washing is usually associated with other health interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programs (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against the impetuousness that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin lesions due to skin resuscitation.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause a condition of skin irritation and irritation known as hand eczema or dermatitis, which is particularly common among health system workers.
The frequent washing of hands is also perceived as one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five crucial moments during the day when washing your hands with soap is important to reduce the fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the bath (mitition, default), after cleaning the pump of a child (change flakes), before feeding a child, before and before/after preparing a meal or handling meat, fish or raw chicken.
Other situations when the right technique for hand washing should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of diseases include before and after treatment of a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or sneezing the nose; after touching animal waste or dealing with animals; and after touching trash.
In many countries, there is a reduced rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of families had the habit of washing their hands with soap. A 2014 study revealed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97%; the United States near the average of 77%; and China with the lowest rate of 23%. Several methods for changing behaviour are currently available to increase the acceptance of hand washing in critical periods. Collective hand washing for children in schools in certain periods of the day is an alternative in developing countries to incut hand washing in children's habits.
The "Basic Health Services Programme" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote children's health and education.
The disparity twice a year, complemented by the washing of hands daily with soap, brushing of teeth daily with flower, are at the centre of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of skin microorganisms is reinforced by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce barriers to the solution, and increase solubility.
The water alone is an inefficient cleaning agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, organic dirt components, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning is, however, facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
The bar soap, depending on its reusable nature, can retain the accumulated bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that analyzed the bacterial transmission of a contaminated bar soap concluded that transmission is unlikely since the bacteria are stuck with the foam.
The CDC repeats "liquid soapet with automatic dosing commands is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps were widely disseminated to the public in terms of health.
Up to now, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants may lead to the selection of organisms resistant to antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, even though antibiotics resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are released.
In addition to skin surfactants and skin protection agents, complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulator, antimicrobial benzoic acid and other skin hydrants (aloe vera, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the hands as antibacterial soaps turned to the final consumer containing triclosan.
Hot water that is comfortable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 oC).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap to remove natural oilyness that retains dirt and bacteria.
Unlike popular belief, however, scientific studies have revealed that using hot water is not effective in reducing the microbial load in the hands.
A hand hygiene or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene agent.
At the end of the 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic base hand hygiene agents (also known as hand-based hand hygiene product, antiseptic hand hygiene product, or hand-hand hygiene) began to gain popularity.
Most are made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), in gel, or an emulsifier, such as glycerin, in liquid, or in foam to facilitate the use and reduce the effect of alcohol recycling.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand hygieneists with a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol kill germs efficiently.
Alcohol-based hygiene agents kill bacteria, multiresistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hygieneists containing 70% of alcohol kill 99.97% (a reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to a reduction of 35 biles) of bacteria in their hands, 30 seconds after their application, and 99.99% to 99.999% (a reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in their hands 1 minute after their application. Hand hygieneists are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand hygieneists are almost completely ineffective against the norovirus type (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Antiseptics for hand or alcohol-based hygiene can be used to moisturize or cover well the two hands.
The back and palm of the hands, between the fingers and their limbs, are sprayed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The finger tips should also be well washed, being rubbed with the two palm trees. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with hand hygiene, especially when hands are visually dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid exterminating action against microorganisms; however, they should not replace the proper washing of their hands unless soap and water are available.
The frequent use of hand-to-hand hygiene by alcohol may cause skin resuscitation, unless embolism and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The alcohol resuscitation effect may be reduced or eliminated by the addition of glycerin and/or other emulsifiers to the formula.
In clinical trials, hand-held hygiene with emulsifiers caused significantly less irritation and resuscitation in the skin than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or the additives present in hand-based alcohol hygiene rarely occur.
The lower tendency to provoke irritative contact dermatitis has become an attractive compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous basic agents do not clean the hands of organic matter, they just disinfect them.
That is why hand hygieneists are not as effective as water and soap for preventing the spread of many pathogens, since pathogens are still in their hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand hygiene is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and historically has been very acute for alcohol and alcohol-based hygiene.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride revealed that they had continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, unlike alcohol, which revealed their reduced efficacy after repeated use, probably due to the increasing adverse reactions in the skin.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford a soapette and instead use ashes or land.
Grey or soil may be more effective than pure water, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, ashes is also a disinfectant agent, since in contact with water it forms an alkalin solution.
WHO recommends ashes and sand as an alternative to soapette when there is no soapette.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the U.S. Disease Control Centre to prevent the transmission of diseases includes the following steps:
Put your hands together with cold or hot running water.
It is recommended that current water as fixed toilets may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not appear to be relevant.
Spread your hands, frying them with a generous amount of sand, including the back of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap removes the germs from the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap instead of pure water.
Squeeze for at least 20 seconds.
The act of frying generates friction, which helps remove the germs of the skin, and frying for a longer time removes more germs.
Get a good grip on running water.
Washing on a foot can recontaminate your hands.
Dry with a dry towel or leave dry in the open air.
Wet or wet hands are more easily recontaminated. The most commonly forgotten areas are the thumb, pulse, areas between fingers and under nails.
Artificials and abandoned enamels can cover microorganisms.
It is often recommended to keep your hands hydrated; dry skin can cause skin lesions capable of increasing the risk of transmission of infection.
Several low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where there is no running water and/or soap, for example, watering a gallon or bath with suitable springs and/or using ashes if necessary in developing countries. In situations with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to store water, such as "improvised towers" and other low-cost options.
An improvised tournament is a simple technology that uses a chain-suspended jar, and a foot-turned lever to clear a small amount of water in your hands and a sand bar.
The effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a discussion about the most effective way for drying in public bathrooms.
A growing volume of research suggests that toilet paper is much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the Toalha paper industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the levels of hygiene presented by the Toalha paper, hand dryers with heated air and the most modern hand dryers with air jet.
After washing and drying hands with hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria was considered, on average, 194% higher in the palm area near the fingers and 254% higher in the rest of the palm.
Drying with air jet dryers caused an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, of 42% in the palm area near the fingers and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying hands with toilet paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, to 76% in the palm area near the fingers and to 77% in the rest of the palm. Researchers also conducted tests to determine whether there was potential for cross-contamination between other users and the bathroom as a result of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which projectes air out of the unit at specified speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to expel microorganisms from the hands and the unit by potentially contaminating other users of the bathroom and the environment up to 2 metres away.
The use of hot-air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Product and Umwelt, different methods for hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in the bacterial count after drying the hands were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and the hand dryers were compared to the drying with toilet paper.
Hand washing with hand-washing wetted washbasins is an alternative to the lack of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand hygieneists should contain at least 60% of alcohol.
Clinical hand washing became mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remember the hospital team to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that the rate of infection decreased with its use.
The clinical washing of the hands is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous quantities of soap and water or gel to savor and spray all parts of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed at the same time as the fingers intertwined.
If there are residues under the nails, a brush can be used to remove them.
Since germs can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to sew well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the towel paper should be used to close the towel (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents hand recontamination by these surfaces.
The aim of hand washing in the medical care environment is to remove pathogen microorganisms ("germes") and avoid transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses forgetting constantly washing their hands before touching the patients, transmitting microorganisms.
One study revealed that proper washing of hands and other simple procedures may decrease the rate of infections in the blood stream related to catheter by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a bulletin demonstrating the hand washing and friction pattern in the health system sectors.
The organization's hand hygiene guidance project can also be found on this site for comments.
An applicable review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may measure and validate the hygiene of their hands if the demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization defines "Five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to body fluids/sanguinos
before an ascetic task, and
The addition of antiseptic chemical substances to the soapnet (medical soapnets or antimicrobials) gives an exterminating action to a hand washing agent.
Such exterminating action may be desirable before surgery or in situations in which antibiotics-resistant organisms are predominant. To "clean" hands for a surgical operation it is necessary to have a tournament that can be open and closed without touching it with hands, some chloroxidine or iodine antiseptics, sterilised towels to dry hands after washing, and a sterilized brush for cleaning and other sterilized tools for cleaning under the ones.
All joys must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands and forearms up to the elbows, usually from 2 to 6 minutes.
A very long time of cleaning (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, the water in the forearms should not go to the hands.
After washing the hands are finished, the hands are played with a sterilized towel and the surgical bat is dressed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after caring for a sick person.
For the control of Staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of hand cleaning in the first 20% washing, and an additional little significant benefit was obtained when the cleaning frequency exceeded 35%.
Wash with common soap more than triples the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to washing with an antibacterial soap. Comparing the hygiene of hands with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds, each revealed that the hygiene of hands on an alcohol-based basis reduced bacterial contamination by 26% to more than an antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than hand hygiene on the basis of alcohol to reduce influenza A virus, H1N1, and Clostridium spores in the hands. Interventions to increase hand hygiene in hospital settings may involve the awareness of the team on hand washing, increase the availability of hand hygiene on the basis of alcohol and verbal and written warnings to the team.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are more effective in different health establishments.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an essential economically viable tool for having a good health and even better nutrition.
However, the absence of reliable water sources, soap or resources to wash hands in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge for the conquest of the universal practice of washing hands.
For example, in most rural Africa, the toilets for hand washing close to any public or private bathrooms are rare, although there are cheap options for the construction of hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may instead be the result of rooted habits rather than the absence of soap and water.
The incentive and protection of hand washing with soap can influence political decisions, lead to awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to a long-term change in behaviour of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing hand washing in low- and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less efficient. An example of promoting hand washing in schools is UNICEF's "three-star approach" that encourages schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to the top three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the promotional hand-washing campaigns aimed at reducing diseases and infant mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness campaign that tries to achieve a change in habits. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronary pandemic, UNICEF has announced the adoption of an emoji to wash hands.
Few studies considered the overall cost/benefit ratio of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the DALY classification.
However, an analysis suggests that promoting the washing of hands with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of washing hands for human health — especially for people in vulnerable circumstances like mothers who have just given birth to wounded soldiers in hospitals — was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two precursors of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, people still believed that the infections were caused by unpleasant smells called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food origin and infections associated with health care led the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively encourage hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "techniques for proper hand washing" were hung close to the floor for hand washing in public bathrooms and in office and airport bathrooms in Germany.
The expression "wash your hands" means to declare the repulsiveness of taking responsibility or being consistent with something.
It originated from the Bible passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but became a more general use phrase in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, representing her guilty conscience about the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It was also verified that people, after remembering or presenting anti-ethical acts, tend to wash their hands more frequently than others, and usually give more importance to hand washing equipment.
Moreover, those who can wash their hands after such a vision are less likely to perform other compensating acts of "cleanness", such as volunteering.
The religions prescribe the washing of hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, using water, but not soap, to wash hands is part of a ritual washing of the hands characteristic in many religions, including the Bahá'i faith, Hinduism, the tevilah and the netilate yadayim in Judaism, the washing of Christianity, and the abolition of Islam. The religions also indicate the hygiene of the hands, especially after some actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam permit the washing of hands after the use of the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islamism authorize the washing of hands before and after meals.
Hazard control at the workplace for COVID-19
Hazard control at work for COVID-19 is the application of health and safety methodologies at work for hazard control for the prevention of coronary disease from 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate hazard controls at the workplace depend on the place of work and work in it, based on the risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers, which may be vulnerable to the contraction of COVID-19.
According to the Department of Health and Safety of Labour (OSHA), the functions with a lower risk of exposure have a minimum occupational contact with the public and other work colleagues, for which basic measures to prevent infection are recommended, including washing hands, encouraging staff to stay at home if they are sick, maintaining a respiratory label and routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Function with average risk of exposure includes those requiring frequent or direct contact with persons who are not known whether they are contaminated or suspected of being contaminated by the COVID-19, but may be infected due to the current Community transmission or because they have travelled abroad.
This includes workers who keep in touch with the general public as in schools, working environments of high population density, and in the market of large volumes.
Risk controls for this group, as well as basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and the provision of individual protection equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that workers in the health and necroterium system who are exposed to people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers perform procedures in people with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected of generating aerosols and collect or handle specimens of these persons.
Appropriate hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protection equipment suitable for the work performed.
The COVID-19 epidemic may have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may leave work because they are sick, because they have to look after other people or because of a possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of which products are in demand and the means of purchasing these products (such as buying out the peak time or by delivery or drive-thru services.
Finally, sending items from areas seriously affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. An action plan and preparation for infectious disease can be used to guide protection actions.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with the various workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors emerging at home and in the community, and risk factors of individual workers such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls necessary to address these risks, and the contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Action and preparation plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of the action for an epidemic include the reduction of transmission among employees, the protection of people at greater risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community, where the company is located, affects the actions taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a structure widely used in health and safety of work to group the hazard controls by effectiveness.
When the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally by individual protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve the isolation of workers from work-related hazards without the worker's behaviour, and can be the most economical implementation solution.
Engineering checks are changes in the policy or working procedures that require the worker's or employer's action.
Individual protection equipment (EPI) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but may help prevent certain exposures.
All types of EPI shall be selected on the basis of the hazard to the worker, adjusted appropriately as necessary (respirators, for example), used appropriately and continuously, inspected regularly, preserved and replaced as necessary, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of properly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Safety of Labour (OSHA), low-risk work has a minimum occupational contact with the public and other work colleagues.
Basic measures to prevent infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and methiculosic washing of the hands, the incentive for workers to stay at home if they are sick and the use of the respiratory label, including the cover of the air and cough, the preparation of containers for lenses and for common garbage, the preparation for telework or for scaled shifts, if necessary, the disincentive of the use of tools and equipment of other workers, and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in the protection of workers, customers, visitors and other people at the workplace.
The U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centre (CDC) recommends that employees who have acute respiratory symptoms stay at home until they have no more fever, fever signs or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without medication to reduce the fever or relief of other symptoms, and also recommends that disease licensing policies be flexible, allow employees to stay at home to care for a patient in the family, and that they have knowledge of these policies.
According to OSHA, work with average exposure risk includes those requiring frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known whether they are confirmed or suspected with COVID-19, but may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to the current Community transmission at the site of the company, or because the individual has a recent history of travel abroad, in a country with high transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who have contact with the public in general such as in schools, working environments of high population density and some high volume retail stores. Engineering controls for this group and for higher risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the expansion of ventilation, the installation of physical barriers, such as the installation of a transparent plastic avant-garde and the installation of a driving-thru window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and higher risk groups include the incentives for workers to stay at home, the replacement of meetings in the presence of virtual communication, the establishment of scheduled tours, the cancellation of non-essential journeys to places with current epidemic of COVID-19, the development of communication plans for communication, including a forum to respond to the concerns of the workers, the institution of the institution and the institution of the institution of the institution, the institution of the institution of the institution, the

Workers in this risk group rarely need breathing.
If a person becomes ill on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the isolation of the patient from the other person for a distance of 6 feet, with the appointment of a crew member to serve the patient and offer her a facial mask, or ask the patient to cover the mouth and nose with tossing or sneezing.
The crew should use removable medical gloves when using a patient passenger or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and possibly additional individual protection equipment if the patient presents fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Luvas and other waste items must be disposed of in a biologically hazardous waste bag, and contaminated surfaces must then be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard controls include delayed travel by the patient, self-insulation and immediate communication to the medical centre on board if someone presents fever or other symptoms during the journey.
The ideal thing is that there is medical follow-up in the person's cabin. For schools and child care centres, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person was present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is a minimum and moderate Community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as the cancellation of travel in the field, assemblies, and other large groups such as physical or coral education classes, or meals in a lanchonet, increasing the space between tables, arrival times and the most rigorous departure, limiting non-essential visitors and using a separate health care place for children with flu symptoms.
When there is a significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, prolonged school leave can be considered. For law enforcement authorities carrying out daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers who contact individuals suspected of being COVID-19 or confirmed disease follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate individual protective equipment.
If direct contact occurs during the arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their belts and other accessories before using them again using a common household cleaning spray or cloth and follow the standard operating procedures for the maintenance and disposal of used EPI and for the maintenance and washing of clothes.
OSHA considers certain health and necroteria workers as being in high or very high risk categories of exposure.
High-risk exposure functions include the workers of delivery of medicines, medical care, medical laboratories and medical transportation, which are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
The risk of exposure is very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, or collect or handle specimens of these patients.
Procedures for the generation of aerosols include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive collection of specimens.
Work in high exposure necroteres include workers involved in the preparation of bodies of people with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected of disease at the time of their death; the risk of exposure becomes very high if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected of disease, including when aerosol generator procedures are performed.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some necroterium scenarios and in the health area.
Species should be handled with the caution of level 3 biosafety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering the hospital be separated in two different waiting areas, depending on whether they are a suspect case for COVID-19. In addition to other EPIs, OSHA recommends breathing for professionals working at a distance of 6 feet from patients with confirmation or suspicion of infection by SARS-CoV-2, and for professionals performing aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, the N95 particulate filter facial respirators approved by NIOSH or higher quality respirators should be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes tests for adjustment, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory agents can provide protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend the use of monkeys, since COPID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
WHO only recommends a surgical mask for screening staff at the point of entry.
For professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or transport patients with COVID-19 without aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, eye protection or facial protection, surgical avantal and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is carried out, the surgical mask is replaced by a breather N95 or FFP2.
Since the overall supply of EPIs is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need for EPIs through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care for patients to enter a comfort with a patient with COVID-19, using only the EPI required for the specific task, continuous use of the same breather without removing it while treating several patients with the same diagnosis, monitor and coordinate the supply chain of EPI and discourage the use of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

ASSOCIATION: [Cavid-19] Attenuation of problems and preparation for the future
EXPIRY DATE: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENÇA: CC0: No rights reserved
People are in unusual circumstances this month.
The epidemic of COVID-19 is something that makes our global human connection clear and the responsibilities we have in relation to the other.
Its challenges have no precedents, but we know that our best actions go together with global empathy, cooperation and the creation of communities, which are the foundations of this organization.
Companheirism and the concern we have seen among all our colleagues through e-mails, links and conversations is a remarkable validation of the incredible human beings with whom we have the privilege of working.
I am extremely grateful and proud to have all of you as workmates.
Last week, someone shared their recognition with me for our work.
This person made me remember how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and what a powerful symbol this essential resource continues online and available to all.
The work of you makes this possible, as you maintain the active workplaces, pay our colleagues and maintain the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a moment when not only what we do but how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its function, we will make important adjustments in the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedules for the next few days and months.
At this meeting, we consider what we think to be an appropriate action to which we are experiencing and the best way to maintain the sustainable organization in that period.
We want to end the stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to stay away for a while, you don't have a problem.
For all employees, service providers and employees by contract:
our daily work expectations will be 4 hours, or 20 hours a week, until otherwise agreed.
We are not declaring a holiday. If you get to work on normal schedule, it may be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, buy maintenance or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedules.
If you're sick, don't work.
This rule should not be expressed, but we have decided to declare it.
You do not need to be certified or paid. Just inform your manager to help your team review the schedule and schedules to ensure that the key areas of the work are served.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, inform the Bryan of the training and certification sector so that its sector can help you and ensure that your situation receives appropriate attention from management).
The staff working per hour will receive the full payment.
We have already said that before, and we are committed to honouring our commitment to our employers and employees working per hour.
They will all receive their wages based on their normal work file under normal circumstances.
Salaries depend on whether you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we give you total support.
Many people view work as a way to channel stress due to the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remembering that your well-being is more important.
We just ask you to communicate to your manager, so we know what to expect and we can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities that we must continue to perform.
Sites, HR, Reliability and Security and Funding Engineering teams (including) carry out essential activities that may require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and change our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is much to be done for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
Disabling now will not harm us in the future.
We do not intend to "work twice to recover lost time" after the pandemic has ended.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to meet terms that are now impracticable.
We accept that the circumstances have changed, and we will work to define new targets and deadlines, as appropriate.
What will happen to Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of hours worked per day, we intend to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide a greater time for the budget, and that employees prioritize essential work, personal care and care for loved ones, while we accommodate those who need or want to work on a reduced day in the coming weeks.
The extension of the chronogram greatly reduces the current planning work load and pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the director next week and update representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the Annual Planning Team for their leadership in this process.
Office status, exhibition and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in São Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, by caution, we have used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces in the office of San Francisco.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entry saw and all lifts that give access to our walk.
The building is using its own duty protocol using products that are safe for its participants.
We are relieved by the fact that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to return.
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork, which shared its protocol for the COVID-19 with us and with all Washington officials.
Last week, our office in Washington changed to a completely remote configuration, in line with the guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we are also discussing the location of an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue, but they can be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that it can be an adjustment, and would like to offer some advice:
They shall limit the duration of the meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If sessions of longer duration are necessary, they are considered to be divided into several days.
They define the meeting, have a programming and send material for reading in advance.
Use videos as default, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate real-time collaboration and connection.
They have a leader to facilitate meetings, someone who monitors the questions in the chat and the list of participants, and someone to help make annotations (or collaborative annotations).
Send an e-mail to the technical support if you need comfortable earphones.
Use your emergency aid to buy chains.
Participate in the #remotes channel to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR operations team is researching ergonomic guidelines in the context of the webinar to help increase remote work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community aid recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the edition marathons, until WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We warn you that we understand that our request for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to complete their agreed subsidy activities, and that no one would be penalized by extending or modifying their targets.
In the coming week, we will continue with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The general feeling in the world community seems to be of sadness with the paralysis, but also of relief with the clarity and ability to keep the focus on its own communities, on Wikimedia and other situations.
The communication resource team is working on creating a page in Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Keeping up-to-date on issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for the next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special meeting with the staff.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we're gonna help with what's needed.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find the information of this email and all other information related to COVID-19 in the company's wiki.
The communication resource team will update these pages and all information in a single location.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with officials who live in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main workflow, or the coverage challenge, or anything else you may need help with, do not stop notifying and working with the communication resource team.
We are here to help provide support and collaboration as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive subject, send an e-mail to Bryan Judan, Director of Global Operations of HR.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and obligations.
They are, however, a recognition that, at this point, our work and our obligations will probably need to be adapted in a way that we do not adapt in the past.
These are the steps that we believe are needed as support at this moment, so that we can continue working, providing our movement with the support they need and providing the world the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be our expectation when the time comes.
Meanwhile, it is time to support each other and create space for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably next months.
We need all of you to do this, so we need everyone to take care of yourself and your family to be in their best condition when necessary.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, communication resource team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin type 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) is an enzyme attached to the external surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ECA2 neutralises the activity of related angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7), becoming a promising medicine for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also acts as an entry point in the cells for some coronary viruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
Angiotensin type 2 converting enzyme is a metaloenzyme containing zinc located on the endothelial surface and other cells.
ECA2 protein contains a peptide M2 N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain transporter of amino acids and collectrin in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single passage type 1 membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed to the surface of the cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is tilted from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released in the blood stream and finally excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is attached to the cell membrane of the major type II alveolar alveolar cells, thin intestine enterocytes, arterial endothelial cells and venous and smooth arterial muscle cells in most organs.
The expression of the mRNA of ECA2 is also found in the brain cortex, stretched body, hypothalamus, and brain trunk.
The main function of ECA2 is to act as a counterweight for ECA.
ECA inhibits Type I angiotensin hormone in Type II angiotensin causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2 in turn inhibits the phenylalanine of carboxitermin amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Is-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-OH).
ECA2 also trembles several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]- bradicin, appelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and grelin.
ECA2 also regulates the transport by the membrane of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup’s disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 works as the primary point of entry into the cells for some coronary viruses, including HCV-NL63; SARS-COV (the virus causing SARS); and SARS-COV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 spike protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of ECA2 in the cell surface results in endocytosis and transfer of the virus and enzyme into endosoms located within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by the serum-protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to raise the hypothesis of reducing ECA2 levels in cells, perhaps helping fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulators recommended to continue with the CCA inhibitor pattern and ARB therapy.
A systematic and meta-analysis review published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ECA inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia in relation to controls".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ECA inhibitors who presented a high risk of contraction of pneumonia, especially those with AVC and heart failure.
The use of ECA inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia".
It is believed that human recombinant ECA2 (rhACE2) is a new therapy for acute pulmonary injury, and it seemed to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with an acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolisaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in human beings is approximately 10 hours, and the onset of action is 30 minutes after the time development of the effects (duration) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to the inhibitors of the classic renin-angiotensin system (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which angiotensin II is high in circulation. RhACE2 infused was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Applications for COVID-19 are mobile software applications to help monitor in response to the pandemic of coronavirus 2019-2020, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") that may have entered into contact with infected individuals.
Numerous applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several structures for creating contact monitoring applications have been developed.
Privacy issues were raised, especially on systems based on the geographical location of the users of the application.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other cells.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, implemented an application that allows citizens to verify whether they were in contact with a carrier of COVID-19.
It is in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by the local IT community, released as an open code and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched the "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the application has been waiting for approval by Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracking application was in an advanced stage of development and would be available for distribution in weeks.
Australia and New Zealand provide applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographical delimitation application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of safety engineering at Cambridge University, listed a series of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if the application acceptance is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple sets limits for the types of organizations that can add applications related to the coronavirus to its App Store, limiting them only to "official" or otherwise respected organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed their concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially if the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat has passed.
International Anistia and more than 100 other organizations have issued a communication requesting limits for this kind of surveillance.
The organisations declared eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of monitoring and surveillance should have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited for the purposes of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data should be protected and presented as protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid worsening discrimination and marginalisation;
any sharing of data with third parties should be provided for by law;
there should be safeguards against abuse and citizens' rights to respond to abuse;
the significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders" would be required, including that of public health specialists and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) from Germany and Reporters without Borders (Reporter without Borders) (RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to deal with the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism of its operating device systems when it is no longer necessary.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of applications, eliminating the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have considerable potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a series of systems that preserve privacy were created to use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system was used to conduct contact tracking.
Instead of using an exclusive application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including data from tracking mobile devices and data from card transactions, combining them to generate warnings via text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential interlocutors, the government has also made the location information publicly available, which is allowed due to the changes in the privacy laws of the information after the emergence of MES in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and sites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy and centralised system.
By 6 April 2020 details had not yet been disclosed.
The tracking of contacts preserving privacy is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific bibliography raising to, at least, 2013. Since 7 April 2020, more than a dozen specialist groups have worked on solutions that respect privacy, with the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register the proximity of one user to other mobile devices.
However, the PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that covers centralized and decentralised approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include the Decentralized Privacy-Proserving Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never comes out of the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy conservation techniques during collection and use of location data or cross-tracking to track the spread of the COVID-19.
It is based on research based on the technical publication "Applications play dirty: keeping personal privacy in an epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a speed that develops privacy technologies and originally founded in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and responsible ones, without compromising the privacy of these data.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was founded by groups that merged around which it was essentially the same approach and largely overhauled protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and allowing global interoperability of alert and tracking applications, a key aspect of the conquest of generalised adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the government's official application, became an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, in which they claimed to preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy preservation.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system provides for implementation in three stages:
development of tools to enable government to create official coronvirus tracking applications while preserving privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to face the persistent and assumed surveillance problems by first distributing the system for operating system updates, and later removing it the same way as the threat ends.
Drug replacement (also known as drug replacement, reperfilation, retribution or therapeutic substitution) is the recommendation of an approved drug for the treatment of a medical condition or disease other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the scientific research lines that are currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drugable proteins, each with multiple binding points.
Analysis of these binding points provides the reasonable design of effective antiviral drug development against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are protease similar to papaine, RNA polymerase dependent on RNA, helicase, protein S and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidate compounds that later improved and analyzed by structural similarities with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in its pre-clinical study to be recommended for a clinical study conception.
Chloroquine is a medicine against malaria that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine related would be among the four drugs studied as part of the clinical trial Solidarity.
New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced that tests with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine of the state of New York would start on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate by means of an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
Treatment was not approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised by the EU only as experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors said they're using the drug when "there's no other option".
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU's Langone Medical School is conducting a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of the disease in 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half was treated with favipiravir, and half received umifenevir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the population that the evidence available to base the medicine is limited and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy Japan's medicine to store it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for Trump administration on the purchase of the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in serious cases of the disease when the virus has already multiplied.
Your use may not be safe for pregnant women or pregnant women trying to get pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir antivirals and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit has been observed".
Drugs were developed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about directing resources for drug reproportion developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Science as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences discovered after remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against wire, pneumonia, paramix, and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance developed by mutations, which may cause more serious transmissions or diseases.
Some initial pre-test studies suggest that remedesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate disease and the other for those with more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials with intravenous vitamin C occurring for people hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19: two of them are controlled by placebo (in China and Canada), while the other one does not present control group (Italy).
The state of New York began conducting tests with azithromycin, an antibiotic, on 24 March 2020.
The National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan plans a clinical test of Alvesco (cyclesonide), Teijin, which is an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma. The goal is to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronary virus.
Phase II of a study with angiotensin 2 converting enzyme type is ongoing with 200 patients, to be recruited among serious cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria, to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
At the moment, researchers at the Heart Institute in Canada are investigating the function of colchicine in reducing pulmonary complications and inflammation in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over the age of 40, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, who did not need to be hospitalized.
Women who are breast-feeding or do not use effective contraception have not been included in the pregnant women's tests.
Various anticoagulants are tested in Italy.
Heparin, of low molecular weight, is being widely used in the treatment of patients, which led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on use.
A multicenter study, with 300 patients, is analyzing the use of enoxaparin sodium in prophylaxis and therapeutic doses. The study was announced on April 14 in Italy.
Due to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the attention of the scientific community has been considerable to give new purpose to approved antiviral drugs and developed for the treatment of previous outbreaks, such as those of MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenevir: umifenevir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics were identified as being able to receive a new purpose for the treatment of patients with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The vaccine for COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against the disease of coronavirus from 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with the clinical tests completed, there are several ongoing attempts to develop it.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said not to expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a virus causing the disease, available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in phase I of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
There was a great spread of the outbreak in 2020, leading to considerable research investments and activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using genomes published for the development of possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, CEPI, the initiative of the Innovation Coalition in Epidemic Preparation, declared that the requirements for the development of the vaccine are the speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported 10 different technology platforms being researched and developing during the beginning of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The objectives of the major platforms that have advanced for Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, type 5 adenovirus vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are at the initial stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute). Other 37 were announced, but with little information available to the public (considered in planning or being designed).
A Phase I-II test performs the preliminary safety and immunogenicity test. It is typically randomized, controlled by placebo and multicenter, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the effectiveness of the vaccine to avoid the disease, while monitoring adverse effects at the ideal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active vaccine (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 had not yet been evaluated in human beings (continued in pre-clinical research).
On 24 January 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular lump, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On 24 January 2020, in Canada, the Center for International Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan, I announced the beginning of work in a vaccine, with the aim of testing in human beings in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Center for Disease Prevention and Control of China on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, pharmaceutical companies Janssen, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced the start of their work for the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is developing an oral vaccine with his biotechnology partner in Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, the Emergency BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the development of a vaccine with a technology similar to that used for neoantigen vaccination therapy on 8 February 2020.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the vaccine synthesis and were starting the tests.
On 27 February 2020, a subsidiary company of Generex, NuGenerex Immmuno-Oncology, announced that they were launching a vaccine project to create a li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "in the next 90 days".
On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington, St. Louis, announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in the Western Maryland region, announced that they were working in a vaccine.
By 10 March 2020, Emergency Biosolutions announced that Novax Inc had joined.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for the pre-clinical test and Phase I of clinical studies in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working with 11 isolates and, even at an accelerated step, would take at least one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in the city of Quebec, reported the development of a particle similar to Coronavirus under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is researching in the laboratory, with the human tests planned for July or August 2020.
At the beginning of that week, The Guardian stated that the President of the United States, Donald Trump, offered CureVac "great sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" under protest by the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to develop together a vaccine based on mRNA.
BNT162, a candidate vaccine based on mRNA, currently in pre-clinical testing, with clinical tests expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced that it would have pre-clinical results in April 2020 and its final vaccine candidate could leave for human tests in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Innovation Coalition in Preparation for Epidemia (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Viena, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI in the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 to $29 million.
The other CEPI investment partners for the development of the vaccine for the COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford, and University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists started testing in animals of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at the Imperial College in London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing an autoamplizing RNA vaccine for the COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving Chinese sequencing.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$ 275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the initiatives of the University of Saskatchewan.
Nearly the same period, the Canadian government announced C$ 192 million specifically to develop the vaccine for COVID-19, with plans to establish a national "vaccination bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if other exits of the Coronavirus occurred.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported the PittCoVacc test, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in rats, stating that "MNA delivered vaccines of the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 that generated powerful responses of specific antibodies to antigens [in mice] that were evident that began 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacteria, DNA will be planned to replicate within a human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to the virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities joined resources to access IBM supercomputers, combined with Hewlett Packard Enterprise cloud computing, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologic effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can benefit beyond the disease it prevents.
A later randomized test in Australia is looking to register 4,170 health workers.
The developing vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine using specimens of specific animals for COVID-19, such as the ACE2-transgenic mouse, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicate a need for level 3 biosecurity containment measures to manipulate live viruses, and an international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have already been tested in specimens of non-human animals.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine protecting against SARS that has proved safe and effective in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became predominant, it was believed that the existing research of SARS could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatment against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was a disease against mers (based on DNA) that concluded phase I clinical studies in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are virus vectored vaccines, two with adenovirus vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one with MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind the COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents quoted by several social media publications indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of Coronavirus such as Coronavirus SARS.
Betacoronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of appetite and abdominal pain.
The time of exposure to the onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some evolve to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153 thousand deaths.
More than 568 thousand people have already been cured. The virus is spread among people mainly during direct contact, usually through gothices produced by cough, spruce or speech.
Although these gothics are produced when they expire, they usually fall to the ground or remain on surfaces rather than remain infectious in long distances.
People may also get infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first 3 days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may be possible before the symptoms occur and in subsequent stages of the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by reaction in the string of the reverse transcription polymerase in real-time (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal Swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of virus and for people responsible for their care.
Recommendations for the use of mask for the general population vary, where some authorities recommend non-use, some recommend use and others require use.
Currently, there is no specific antiviral vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.
The local transmission of the disease was recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Virus infected people may be asymptomatic or develop symptoms similar to flu, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty in keeping awake, face or blue lips.
Less common, symptoms of upper respiratory tract such as spleen, nose walking or throat pain can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only open to the chest and palpitations.
In some, the disease can evolve into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is the so-called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually six days, but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection.
The function of these asymptomatics in transmission is not yet fully known; however, a preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their stay in the hospital.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
The scarf and the saliva can carry large viral loads.
Speaking high frees more gothics than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that tossing without covering your mouth can make gothics reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually transported by air, the National Academy of Science suggested that bio-airsol transmission can be possible and air collectors positioned in corridors outside the rooms of people contain positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (RCP), can generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolized and therefore transmitted by air.
Although there is concern that it can be transmitted through the faeces, it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people are symptomatic. Although it is possible to have transmission before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that, although it is not completely clear the ease with which the disease is spread, a person usually infected one or two. The virus survives for hours or days on the surface.
In particular, it was found that the virus was detectable for a day in paper, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in copper 99%.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature.
Sand and detergent are also effective if they are used correctly. Products with sand degrade the protective lipid envelope of the virus, disabling it, as well as eliminating it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and clorexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample presented the highest viral load, while the sixth patient presented the highest viral load on the second day tested.
The acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who had a relationship with a group of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronary viruses.
Outside of the human body, the virus dies in contact with domestic soap, which breaks its protective layer. SARS-COV-2 is intimately linked to the original SARS-COV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the conversion enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2), which is more abundant in the alveolar type II cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spicula" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac injury was observed in 12% of the infected people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in serious illness.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease development, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in the cardiac function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to severe prognosis. Necropsias of people who died due to COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropics for epithelial cells of the respiratory tract that express ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was demonstrated that the pathogen T cells secreting GM-CSF are related to the recruitment of IL-6 secretive inflammatory monocytes and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lyphocytic infiltrates have also been reported in neuropsy.
WHO published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the reaction in the polymerase chain via reverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed in respiratory samples obtained by means of a nasopharyngeal Swab, however a nasal Swab or catarro sample may be used.
The results are usually available in a few hours up to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but for this it is necessary to collect two blood samples with two weeks of difference and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish their genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect virus infection.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if a person was infected in the past) were in development, but have not yet been widely used.
The experience of the Chinese with the test showed that their accuracy is from 60 to 70%.
The U.S. FDA approved the first remote laboratory test on 21 March 2020, for use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines released by the Wuhan University Hospital Zhongnan suggest methods to detect infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Facial, amethyst, and posterior distribution are common at the beginning of the infection.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic flooring (seven lobulars thickened with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
There are few available data on microscopic lesions and physiopathology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity may be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumonia hyperplasia, major atypical pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxia.
Pneumonia treated: organisation of exams in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: distributed intravascular coagulation (CID); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with hands without washing.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a tossing or sneezing brush, as well as close the mouth with the inner side of the elbow if the brush is not available.
The proper hygiene of the hand after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of clothing masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling large public meetings.
Distance guidelines also include that people stay at least 1.8 meters (6 feet) away from each other.
It is not known an effective medicine for the prevention of COVID-19. Since the vaccine should not be released before 2021, a key point for controlling COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, also known as the "acquisition of the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when the hands are clearly dirty, before eating and after touching the nose, coughing or breathing.
It also recommends using hand-based antiseptic alcohol with at least 60% of alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For places where commercial hand-hand antiseptics are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity is given by means of ethanol or isopropanol.
The hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "an active substance for hand asepsis".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizing agent.
People are treated with palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect that they are using the virus use a simple facial mask.
The oxygenation of the extracorporeal membrane (ECMO) was used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analysed.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms and early stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
U.S. Intensive and Pneumologists gathered recommendations for the treatment of several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
By April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Caution is needed to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in the health environment, when procedures are being carried out that can generate aerosols, such as intubation and manual ventilation.
For health professionals taking care of people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends putting the person in rooms with air-borne infections isolation (SIIA) besides taking the standard precautions, contact precautions and air precautions. The CDC summarizes the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (EPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: EPI blanket, breathing machine or facial mask, visual protection and medical gloves. When available, it is preferable to use breathing machines instead of facial masks.
Respirators N95 are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized the masks for use under Emergency Use Authorisation (U.S.).
They were designed to protect against air particles as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for undescribed uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial shields or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not serious enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with respiratory insufficiency related to COVID-19 is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal channel or positive pressure on airways at two levels.
If either of these two leads to the same benefits for people who are seriously ill, it is not known.
Some doctors prefer to stay with the invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high flow nasal channel. Serious cases are more common in elderly people (those over 60 years of age and, especially, over 80 years of age).
Many developing countries do not have per capita hospital beds in sufficient quantity, which limits the health system's ability to deal with sudden escalation in the number of cases of serious COVID-19 enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive therapy units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of the people in the COVID-19 hospital were eventually taken to ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) develops in the COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Fans with high pressure control and PEEP level are needed to increase oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of pulmonary lesions and in the pneumothorax associated with ventilation.
A high level of PEEP may not be available in older fans.
Research for potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical trials are being carried out with various antiviral medicines.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new medicines may take up to 2021 to be developed, several of the medicines tested have already been approved for other uses or are in an advanced phase of testing.
Antiviral therapy may be tested in people with various diseases.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in the effectiveness and safety tests of potential treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorisation for the use of plasma for convalescent people as treatment in cases where the person's life is serious and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies necessary to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the disease have not yet been conducted.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
It is requested that users report their name and ID number.
The application can detect the "neighbor contact" using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also verify the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends quarantine as well as alerts local health authorities. Big data analysis of mobile data, facial recognition technology, mobile telephony tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and the people with whom they were contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorised security agencies to track mobile phone data from people who are allegedly with coronviruses.
The measure was taken to strengthen the quarantine and protect people who can contact infected citizens.
Even in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated data of telephone location with the German federal government agency Robert Koch Institute to investigate and prevent transmission of the virus.
Russia implemented the facial recognition technology to detect who pays off the quarantine.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said he had been informed by cell operators that "40% of the people continue to circulate even so".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackaton at the end of the week with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of coronvirus.
Individuals may experience difficulties in the quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection in themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "The increase in social isolation, solidarity, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis are a perfect storm to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have a slight evolution, with few or no symptoms, seem to be other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as refrigerated.
Mild cases usually recovered within two weeks, while those with serious or critical disease may take from three to six weeks to recover.
Female pregnant women may have a higher risk of serious infection of COVID-19, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data from COVID-19 are missing. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorders and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Coagulation disorders, specifically the increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, while renal failure was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early study, the median onset of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total interval of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of samples after lung death show diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromyxides exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathetic alterations were observed in the pneumocytoids.
The lung image examination looked like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, damage was detected in the heart due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of the hospitalized had pre-existing comorbidities. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic factors in a region can also affect mortality.
The estimates of comorbidity mortality vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The sub-notification of mild cases may lead to overestimation of the mortality rate.
However, the fact that the deaths are the result of past cases may mean that the current rate of mortality is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or to die compared to non-smokers. Concerns were raised about long-term disease sequelae.
Hong Kong hospital authority verified a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung examinations indicated damage in the body.
This can also lead to intensive post-care syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections gave effective and lasting immunity to people recovering from the disease.
Immunity is considered probable, based on the behavior of other coronviruses, but cases have been reported where the recovery of COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronvirus on a later date.
These cases are believed to be the worst of a prolonged infection rather than a reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has animal origin, by means of transshipment infection.
The real origin is unknown, but since December 2019, the spread of infection has become almost entirely driven by human transmission.
A study with the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
WHO official publications reported the oldest date of onset of symptoms as of December 8, 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary in region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time taken from the initial onset and population characteristics such as age, sex and health in general.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency CID-10 emergency codes U07.1 for SARS-CoV-2 infected deaths confirmed in the laboratory and U07.2 for deaths confirmed by COVID-19 with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, without SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in the laboratory. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
Based on the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the overall fatality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2.240.191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies from region to region. Other measures include the rate of fatality per case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the rate of fatality per infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and not diagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and accompany a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information on how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of exit in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small population of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths by COVID-19 should have been formally registered as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as verified in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) had death confirmed by COVID-19.
The impact of pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is greater in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is in the 50-year-old range, with the difference between men and women approaching only 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for the difference between sexes are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences due to sex, lower prevalence of smoking women and the development of comorbidities by men as hypertension at a lower age than women may have contributed to the greater mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals were men, and 72% of the dead by COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government was not tracking data on sex-related COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
WHO's head, Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus, explained that "CO" is "cron", "VI", "virus", "D", disease and "19" is from when the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g.: China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus caused by COVID-19 was called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended "2019-nCov" and "acute respiratory disease by 2019-nCOV" as interim names for the virus and the disease, according to the 2015 guidance against the use of locals in names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasopharyngeal Zaragotes and breathing parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a breather valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver the necessary chronogram, a local startup made reverse engineering and printed the 100 necessary valves from one day to the other.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, theories of conspiracy, incorrect information and misinformation about the origin, size, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged, which quickly spread over the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicinal product or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is ongoing in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to assess the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with more likely efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers aim to develop a vaccine with the entire virus.
The use of this virus, whether it is inactive or dead, aims to cause a rapid immunological response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunitary vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the protein of the mirror that helps the virus enter the receptor of the enzyme ACE2.
A third strategy is that of nuclear acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should have the safety and efficacy tested. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. The antibody-dependent improvement was identified as a possible challenge for the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 clinical trials in progress since April 2020.
Seven tests evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The redirection of antiviral drugs consists of most of the Chinese studies, with nine clinical tests in phase III of the remedisive in several countries due to a report at the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of drug and vaccine candidates for COVID-19 was under way in April 2020. Various existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, including remedesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with beta interferon.
There is an attempt to prove the effectiveness of remedisive since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remedesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the USA, China and Italy. The chloroquine, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, Wuhan's Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that the dobile of this dose is highly dangerous and can be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA published an emergency authorisation for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to doctors treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenevir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended to be studied more in vivo after demonstrating low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the protein of the initial mirror in preparation for serum transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have significant limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies. oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The storm of cytokine may be a complication in the subsequent stages of serious COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine anti-tempestade properties. Tocilzumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after the completion of a small study.
A non-randomized test is under way at national level 2 in Italy, after having demonstrated positive results in people with serious disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected to neutralize these developments, which are considered due to the death of some affected people.
