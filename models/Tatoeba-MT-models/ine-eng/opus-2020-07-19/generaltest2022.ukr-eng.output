If there are no alternatives, I still agree.
Thank you very much.
The people in Herson went back to the meeting, the Russians didn't make it.
As participants told the agency, the Hersons were able to hold a meeting before the military rhp with the technique came to an end.
"We've made it to the meeting. Now the rf technique has arrived," said one of the participants in the event.
In the past, the citizens had traditionally gathered in protests on the area of Freedoms, near the ODA building and the suburbs.
Like the building, this area is controlled by armed Russian troops who use weapons against rallyers and steal people.
On April 3, Russian armed forces reportedly used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kahovka.
According to Ukrainfort, the population regularly protests against the Russian aggressor.
Russian troops use force and weapons against humans, are wounded and detained.
Also, Russian predators steal the inhabitants of the area.
President Volodymir Zelenski has enriched Herson with a special name called the City Hero.
On February 24, President Rf Road started a full-scale invasion in Ukraine.
Russian armies are shooting and destroying key infrastructures, mass shootings of Ukrainian cities and forces using artillery, fire-fighting reactors and ballistic missiles.

The Key to My Life
Sasha was not at school today, and I wrote to the teachers in the mail.
Hi, I'm sick, so it's better to take our meeting to the next weekend, I'm sorry.
I can cook, especially for a recipe, but I like to cook.
In Ukraine, there is a traditional beard, aprons, others.
I don't have any favorite foods, I like to taste different dishes from different countries.
What do you like about food?
I want to be busy.
The train is more precise, and there's no place.
I'm sorry, but we're a little late.
Lucía, can I have a kitchen assistant?
It is very good that Julia will be able to go to work.
I went to their apartment last night.
It's very well written and convenient.
On Tuesday, Pablo will tell me if he will work for Nazareth in the brewery and when he should come to make an appointment.
If Nazar works at 5:30, he can use any train:
Green: Mariúpolis - the heart of war, stop fighting - we will have weak positions
President Volodymir Zelenski believes that the battles to the east of Ukraine and, in particular, to Mariúpolis will determine the course of war -- and if the U.S.A. is defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and reoccupy the occupied territories.
The real thing is, "Mariopolis is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
It's fighting, we're fighting, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have weaker positions.
They (the city’s defenders) are people who have drawn on themselves a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupoli, the stronger our position will be on the east side of the state, in the (area) OAS, and if they are stronger, the negotiating table will be closer to us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation is weak in all these ways, we may not expect to meet.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to the return even to the cities that we have now dispossessed.
They can go for it.
Then our situation in the talks will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we do.
We believe in our outcome, in our victory..."
Details: Greenski also said to go to the negotiations after the Ukrainians have been harassed, but "we should not lose the ability to make a diplomatic decision if they're with us."
It's a straight word: "People will accept peace at any rate because people want this war to end.
Under our conditions, under the conditions of independence of Ukraine, but... every family has lost something, and I don't think they will be satisfied with any peace on any condition.
But if we don't talk emotionally, the war should end in peace, or it will end in millions of victims.
And even where millions of victims come to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight — but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing left, there's no people."
Good morning, do you still have free seats for the Czech course for adults from 7:00 a.m. on Tuesday?

In connection with the change in Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new quality.
The same analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, state study
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows us to look at the postmodern context as where the metaphor plays the role of axiological criterion

The chief intelligence department of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine published a list of Russian military officials who participated in military crimes in the Butch Kyiv region.
According to Ukrainform, this is reported by the U.S. Department of Defence Research in Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian must know their names!
GUR MO Ukraine has acquired a list of 64 individual motorbike crew members who are directly involved in military crimes against the people of Ukraine in Buča," the report goes.
The HOUR MOU notes that for crimes committed against the peaceful population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought before the court and will be brought to justice.
You can view the list by using a link.
According to Ukrainfort, Irpina, Bucha, Hostomel, and the entire Kyiv region were freed from Russian predators.
Free cities and villages have mass killings by Russian military civilians.
On April 1, Buchi City’s head, Anatolio Fedoruk, reported that 280 people had been buried in brotherly graves.
Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova stated that 410 bodies of killed civilians were exported on 3 April from the Russian outlaws in the Kyiv area.
On February 24, Russia’s president, Vladimir, announced the beginning of a full - scale invasion in Ukraine.
The armies of Russian predators are shooting and destroying key infrastructures, carrying out mass shootings of Ukrainian cities and forces using artillery, reactive fire systems, ballistic missiles, aviation.
Good morning, I'm sorry, but I can't work with you because I'm going to fly to Canada as soon as possible.

I don't want to bother you, rest.
I've been watching the weather forecast.

Just fine clothes at normal prices and sizes.
We were in the store at the railway station.
Professions that are offered, possible without language?
It's important, if there's such a tradition, I need to know that I'm preparing.
I thought about it a week, but we're gonna have a situation that's gonna get worse.
Tomorrow might be a bad connection on the road.
I am grateful to each person for his experience, even if he is painful.
I believe that it has been experienced in every situation for me not to repeat mistakes in the future.
The directives are in the form of numbered written supplements, which are part of this Regulation.
I'm sure that won't be a problem.
In Ukraine, many people are celebrating the same week.
This depends on faith.
Is there a Greek-Catholic or a Catholic?
At first, you can try it for free.
Maybe you'll write us a salary algorithm, we'll pay ourselves.
We have the paper that children receive at the end of the school year, and they receive testimony at birth and in marriage
Yeah, he's on it as an experienced driver, but I don't know if it's better.

We promised that when you go to school, we'll bring you a surprise.
It's been great, I've got the money for two months of rent, the area in Olomouca doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of animal abuse from civilian populations north of Kiev.
The photos of people being shot and shot have confused the entire civilized world.
Tens of people question each other, how could this happen in the 21st century?
I was not surprised at anything, but it was what I was waiting for and what was going on.
I took out children and elderly parents from Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls and colleagues with the children, and only then returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, he has been continuously helping the U.S.A., and I have no doubt that in the case of occupation, the priority of Kiev will not be to save my family.
Because I was also absolutely sure that the essence of the filthy Communist-KDBist regime remained unchanged since 1918.
Without a terror, he just can't exist, he's built on a terror.
In 1937 one of my ancestors was shot in the prison of Zitomir.
A few years ago, a copy of the Grilling Case was given to the GST: the whole case is over a hundred pages, and the sentence on the loss is much simpler and even more frightening.
The accused was unwritten, he denied the guilt.
The ethnic pole, the Catholic, had five children, was of the free people, a poor "one-room" path, never walked in the creeks.
The fact that they lived on a farm and had several cows was enough to appeal to the smoker and the year - old child to die.
The parents did not even know where to bury.
My grandmother said that she had taken about a hundred people out of the village and killed all but two people who agreed to give a false testimony.
In the criminal case, there is the name of the beating Sharius.
Our former speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and I'm not surprised if his family was the CDB's informant.
Apple from the apple is as far as you know, falling...
The brutal three who claimed to have lost the peasants were ethnic Russians.
By analyzing the case of prejudice, he was interested in various information resources.
There are wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia, such as the "Immortal Barack", which are a good reminder of the events of those years.
Thus, in modern times, the descendants of the NKHDs have found ways to punish and destroy almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found the mass graves of the victims of Stalinist repression and publicly wrote the names of the murderers were first discredited and then destroyed.
It's like the computer found files with child pornography, they put her in jail, and she died fast there.
The CDB is now killing those who are trying to learn the truth about the crimes of the past century.
Why, then, do you suddenly wonder at their actions now?
It focuses on the worst traits of human nature.
Over a thousand years of order tradition, slavery and imperialism were imposed in the 16th and 19th centuries.
And then, over what happened, they did an animal genetic experiment, cutting the intelligence over a few minutes of red terror.
Look at the 1992 semi-French movie "Czechist", that's all.
You saw my picture in the bathroom.
Can you ask your wife what I can buy from the cough?
I'm sorry because I don't have to ask anyone.
I still wanted to ask you maybe you know where the kids went, because Gala can't sign them.
Igor asked if you would like to go tomorrow? (It's an exit and can go because the car hasn't been seen at the station yet.)
We don't really care about you that much.
You are very helpful, thank you!
In the city of Bordojan, under Kiev, a body of 7 civilians was discovered in two multifloor - roof homes.
The defenders of Mariupola stated that the city of an unknown toxic substance from the Russian pilotless.
Three people were injured.
In Russian prisons, approximately 1,700 Ukrainian defenders and civilians are held.

□ Germany will allocate 1 million euros to support the International Criminal Court, which investigates the war crimes of the Russian army in Ukraine.
Canada has imposed sanctions on 33 companies in the Russian defence sector.

When girls return with what do they then do?
We came to a place where we were settled from the center in pardubice, conditions good.
But there's a big one, but there's men living here drinking alcohol and smoking in the premises, loud music is the least that "mutol" is, the smell of cigarettes drinking men, and we and the kids... are afraid to sleep if they're honest.
Please help with the house, for money please.
But that's where it's safe and not smoked.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is like this, unless it's right here they're smoking.
I'm asking you very much, one of them is almost standing on his feet, something is screaming, something he doesn't like.
I'm just asking if you can help.
The main thing is that we understood each other.
Very positive, such a wonderful garden, such happy educators.
You're doing so much for us, it's amazing, thank you very much.
Good evening, Stephanie, Agatha wants to take part in the game, she quit for the game.

How will I be at the main entrance, and you will open?
I wanted to go somewhere else to watch a cake for Karen.
I forgot to write to you, I'm sorry.
Everything went very well yesterday.
We talked about children with a special need for you and their education system in Ukraine.
When Mrs. Shaw presented me as an employee of the Fpoint, the first question was how they found the dog, how they found the mops.
All follow the Facebook page.
They asked you to say hello and that they're very interested in reading the news.
They've been talking about people of Roman nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.
And they agreed that if the child and the parents don't understand the Czech at all, then after work, I can help them by phone.
I need to change my desk, two sets.

So in Nestor until only a nightmare and in Galinka temperature 37.7 at night 38
General Chapek's going there very slowly.
There's a chance for everyone.
Above all, love is real and mutual.
I don't know how in Europe, but in our country, people get married for various reasons, mostly for useful, mercenary purposes.
And I have a problem with that if I don't love a man, he can't do anything.
Yeah, we took her home and took her by herself right away.
She was very grateful, and she was crying.
I told her about you and how you help the Ukrainians.
The tears were in her eyes.
I said if that could be some old blanket and pillow.
But it doesn't have to be, unless it is.
I was so sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.
I had many questions to ask God about why things were happening in my life, and I just had to be disappointed in everything.
I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go, and you made the congregations.
That's right, but we're not going around the area yet and we don't know where everything is. We've been looking for an hour and back the supermarket.
Even now, I thought about you, and you wrote to me.
Does your father only speak Russian or is he a family member?
It's possible for the kids to come to Wally and play in the lobby.
All right, then let's risk :)
I'm glad to meet you, too.
She was talking to Volodymir at the house, and I was wondering if they could find me or if they were looking for themselves, and they said to the ladies who live with us that we should go to the metro station there is a facility that helps find the house.
Because of the little one, I'm going to cross the barrier.
I didn't know the answers to some of their questions.
That would be good on Thursday, if possible.
I can't call a doctor because I haven't done a food license check yet.
But I can't call him because I'm done with the money.
I can't fill the phone because I don't understand it in Czech online banking, but from the Ukrainian bank card, it doesn't fill it.
In addition, I can't change the tariff so I have normal calls and the Internet can't fill the number.
I'm already out of my mind.
Where's the pass, and the face... the title doesn't sound right what you meant?
I’m ashamed to be out of work
She just wrote that in school.
I'm sorry I was worried, I was very worried.
But it's closer than they're leaving Ukraine to know exactly what they're going to come.
Because there's a question in life right now.
Yes, the size of 10-11 years, but our size doesn't match.
I'm looking for everything for the house and the children.
Thanks to the people I've been accepted I live in the chapel they're always asking if I need a shot and I'm ashamed to say I'm asking to find myself.
I've just come home, I'm having a breakfast:)
Don't explain anything, please do what I don't have.
cannot answer without a summary
Mom, I can't tell you this:)
And I don't really think that she couldn't keep herself from feeling before we left the apartment... like tonight....
Let the God of Yura sleep, maybe, and then I'll lie down, sleep a little bit.
I'll write to you anyway.
Hi. Susana, help me. I'm paid for in March. It's for two of us with July or just me, I can't figure out why that's so much.

We have one of the best flights in the area in the village
It's fun to talk to you, and I like it.
I went to karitas, and I was offered a temporary residence for a week -- two, but I need a permanent home where I could be with a child, and why does it stay less and less?
Flowers have been planted. It's okay. Everyone has rest and is very nice.
As "European Truth" reports, the World writes with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economics on Saturday.
The value of 100 guubs, including the educational set and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Also proposed are the hookers in the BTR Boxer version of 1.2 billion euros.
While fighting tanks have to pick up relatively close to the enemy’s target, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire more than 20 miles [30 km] away.
According to the Ukrainian government circle with reference to the KMW proposal, the provision of self - centered hoods will follow a circular scheme.
In the shortest term, the Bundeswer will give Kiev 100 of its shells, and the gaps that have been created will then be filled with industry at the second stage.
The first new hoods may be placed 30 months after the contract was signed, or the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed by 2027.
Is this the first half of the day, or the second half of the day together?
Thank you.
I'm going to work tomorrow without a commission, and then when my doctor heals I'm going to go to the commission I get it right?
How can I change my T-mobile tariff package for 4 gigabytes for 249 kroner now?
Hi, I'm sorry, do you want to know if you need a worker?
Maybe the floor of a wash or a dish.
I don't know the language from Ukraine, but I need work.
I'm young and active, I'm 21 years old.
I'll agree to any work.
I speak Czech at the basic level, but every day I'm studying, so I think I'm going to study everything that's needed to work without problems.
Something I told you today, I'm sure it's time for you to go to work tomorrow.
If I can, I'll take these pants for work.
You're smart and everything's going to be fine! Rest, get the strengths and the beauty of a strong sleep!

How Much This Specialty Has Learned
If it was warm, it would be very good.
I've made an online application, and I'm gonna try and get back to work today.
We're all good. We're dealing with a rainstorm, we've got experience in Ukraine with gas, but since it's very expensive, we've had a lot of wood.
Hello, Lena, please tell me where the office store is nearby.
Tomorrow we're going to Prague to watch the apartment.
It's the same thing.
I have to take Karinka with me.
I put in a towel, I came home, and I said that there's a writing on the table near the door of the sewer repair can, you can follow or you need to turn off the towel.
It says that my status will change for 24 hours, but why?
The former man can't calm down, he'll take me to the real drama.
How do I want anything that officially connects us to him as soon as possible?
Thank you for something we don't have here very well.
And we've even already got the product from the letters.
I'm sorry I messed up.
I didn't understand Czech so well then.
I must have thought of something.
True, they're going to school like that three because Gala and Svetlav are learning remotely to graduate from Ukrainian school and get a certificate of graduation already in the axles they need to go to the knots
Tell me how to get to the city center.
I'll share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is the secret of two people who do not discuss each other with their relatives or friends.
A man and a woman themselves decide the questions in their family, especially without the participation of their relatives.
Can we be together?
It'll take a while before we're around.
Why don't you try it that way?
I rented a car for 9 people, we'll come with Maryan and your family.
How much time do you have?
Yeah, I'm glad to hear jazz.
Thanks to this application, I've been talking about it in Czech on Wednesday.

Thank you for such a nice and happy day.
We liked it very much.
We feel like we are in our family.
The children spent the whole evening talking to Dad, to all grandmothers, and to their grandparents how well they were with you.
From the girls to the best wishes of us for the festival.
And now we've been looking.
I hope the son comes out alive from this mess.
Let's go today, something might be necessary.
How do you connect them to open the door?
Is there any improvement in the coronavir leaching?
Thank you very much for helping people.
We're in Slapa now, we've been harassed by friends for an hour.
My family is a man, a daughter, a son of 11.
The man had already found a job driver.
I'm a massager. I'm looking for a job.
In order for children to attend school and I could work, we need a home not far from civilization.

It's about 1.5 years in a ghost shower.

I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, honey, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I'm going to deal with it like we're together.
I'd say after the war there will be a lot of work.
So I'm not afraid I can't find her there.
I know a lot of things.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know what to do with the house.
I need to go through the food license exam.
Please tell them to cook the apartment tomorrow for 5 guests.
5th place I understand that way in the TV room?
To lay down and bury the couch?
Can we stop until Mrs. Margarita finds us a place to live?

Not the new one that's been used, but it's working but it's not necessary.
Write the address in Czech, let's look at the map where it's from us.
I don't know how much free space there is so I can't plan anything with furniture this week I want to finally look at that apartment and then figure out what furniture I need.
I'm sorry she answered so long, it was a working day, it's hard to adapt

Oleg is sick, it's cold and cough.
I'm just gonna be a little bit later, about 8:00, okay?
I don't want to argue with you.
Because I'm worried that it's all right!
Because with these excursions we didn't even talk about it!
I understand how important it is to you!
And I'm talking about myself (for me, it's just the top I can't reach!)
How do you feel today?
Hey, I'm sorry, I just woke up, I slept bad.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was disappointed that we and Colleague had begun to translate the test yesterday.
I will ask whether Gregory Denisenka or Yonascheka can) to help me with a little bit of math.
Maybe I can be useful to them, too?
If that's possible, I want to draw mathematical terms for the weekend.
Geometry is actually difficult, but we have to work with Colleague in a way that makes no mistakes.
Thank you for testing.
We're looking forward to that too.
And so she's very happy with any gift
I wanted to connect to my Czech number
Yesterday at the stop of 402 buses, I met Ukraine, Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she herself... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we agreed to be friends.
And last night I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person in Ukraine where my heart was touched.
Philia in Hall No29 is specially designed for supplying and processing applications for assistance
Turns out I ordered a backup card.
No, I'm just a man.
So she wouldn't be afraid of anyone coming.
I didn't go, so I did, and that's what I can do.
So you're leaving town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babin Yar Memorial Center in Kiev, we held 80 years of mass shooting by the Ukrainian Jewish soldiers in Babin Yar.
I had the honour to speak after three heads of state, including the president of Germany.
He spoke of "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their way and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We have to protect this base -- it's also part of our responsibility to our history."
If "evil demons of the past appear in new clothes today," he said, "for us Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The fight must go on."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of peacekeepers, starved its inhabitants and allowed them to die of disease.
Russian armies carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually recalling the shootings in Babi Yaru.
For more than a month, the Germans see it in real-time news.
Yes, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, and weapons that have not been so long before.
Germany withdraws the supply of heavy weapons necessary for Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to speak against the swastika.
This means combating all possible means of mass murder, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy way to conquer evil without risks and victims and stop the atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you at night
We agree, make a trip, and write down when we get together.
All the sick only Lydia not sick in them was the omicron of a new species of cow

Sergei Sidorenko: Our NATO membership ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were opposed to NATO entry and only 18% of the respondents said "for".
After the revolution of Hydenia, the escapes of Victor Yanukovic, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the Donbasi war, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, to grow.
After the beginning of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record of Ukraine's support for NATO's entry among Ukrainian citizens, more than 75%.
Despite the support of Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO is carrying out under the conditions of war, there are now many criticisms on the Alliance's and the member countries' account of the lack of time-consuming weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to "fight" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to decline its membership in the Alliance by the position of the RF if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including the military.
In the new episode of the "Secret Questions" campaign, along with the editor "European Truth", we talk about how Ukraine's Alliance has helped since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticised for, and why the Alliance is criticised for, why our prospect of NATO membership is as close as ever in history and why the security guarantees discussed in the talks with Russia can become another Budapest Memorandum.
How do you think it's here?
I have a partner who says that my application is under consideration.
I gave it to her because of this mobile plug-in.
There are no visas, we need to go to the convention center and learn how to do this because it was designed in Poland, there were no visas, and there were no passports.
We have to write to you!
Dennis went in a good mood today.
He agreed to meet a boy from Ukraine he met yesterday at school to show him everything.
So I hope he's all right.
Because then I don't like it, it's not long enough.
In Ukraine it is reported that the Czech Republic has sent a T-72 tank to Ukraine and a foot-and-mouth war machine.
I'm going to leave my children alone there for 3-4 years and I'm going home because I can't leave anymore.
And take it with you at 6-7 in the morning.
Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had a real feeling about this man, but he did not do so well, and I left him.
After a while, he came back and apologized to me.
I turned him down.
Then, after a while, he telephoned what had been done in his heart.
He asked me to talk to him, and I felt sorry for him.
I supported him in a psychological way for almost half a year.
During this time, we had a lot of conversations.
At that time, I had problems at work.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual help.
And I thought, maybe you really need to look at him differently.
And he offered to marry me, and two days later he died.
So God himself decided our fate.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
And he talks only in Czech.
I wanted to say that I was able to find a home, and I am very happy to have where I live right now and where I have to be with my baby.
Did I need to be mentioned earlier?
) Because I helped watch the children in the family.
Don't apologize, just write down what sentence you didn't understand.

You're making me feel better.
All right, give me something else, and I'm not sleeping, I'm still asleep, and I'm dreaming of a bomb...
God is never late, all his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me:)
I understand the price of unqualified work, and I understand that the kind of work I had at home in Kiev I can't have here and the money I made at home, I won't get here right now.
But I just sit down and don't do anything I can't do, because then all the bad thoughts in my head lie down, so you have to do something physical.
At the airport, documents are drawn from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and at another time you can just wait.
Volodymir came back at 4:00 a.m.
That's why we took them to us.
We slept with Vic in the kitchen, put them in the bedroom.
I'll finish my job and go to the airport with them.
When you have it, write it down and find out what's next...
And then I can't find a place anymore.
Sir, please, these are Ukrainian children's invitations to enter the gymnasium.
Yeah, but I'm doing it hard.
Okay, write me when it's convenient.

That's what we planned.
I'm sorry, I really don't have missed calls in the middle.
The proposed work, the cleaning of the bathroom and the toilet, the washing of 3 windows, the spraying of the dust.
It's about 3-4 hours, a sum of 800 grains once, from 19.04 on Tuesday, from 14.00.
I hope I'll just tell you what we're doing.
Can I call you?
Or can you write down your wife’s contact?
I started coughing, I want to ask what I can buy in the pharmacy.
I want to ask for advice.

We want to notify you of the change in the location and together provide documents for the continuation of the map
We're going to get all the hospitals in our country now.
And I forgot to tell you there's going to be a trial tomorrow.
One mother said it's hot for the kids with a hot kiss.
He's coming to you for guests.
Please tell me, and do you have an approximate schedule of cleaning the apartment for a month ahead, even if for the approximate understanding of what days?
I don't remember this schedule at all.
The Russian army threatens to strike rockets in Kiev: they say, "They didn't do that before."
The direct language of Konashenko is, "We see the attempts of diversions and the task of hitting Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the RF.
If such cases persist, the armed forces of the RF will strike the decision-making centres, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army had previously been held."
Russians have been hit by rockets on Kiev since the first days of a full-scale invasion of the RF occupying Forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles that destroyed the Ukrainian WHO system fell into a multi-quarter building on the city’s Poznak.
On February 26, the Russian missile was involved in a multifaceted flood at Valeria Lobanovski.
On March 1, the Russians launched a television program on the Roads near Babina Yaru, resulting in the deaths of five passersby.
On March 2, Ukraine's WHO systems crashed over the South Railway Station, Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defence.
March 14 crash of the crash rockets broke the house and trolleybus on the Kurenevac in Kiev
On March 18, the Russian missile hit the vineyard mass on Vinogradari, one of which died, another 19 people were injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russia’s war rockets destroyed the modern TRC Retroville in Vinogradari, resulting in at least 4 deaths.
The mayor of Kiev, Vitaly Klicko, told him on April 13, that the residents of the capital were evacuated from the city until they returned early.
The military explained to the local authorities that Russians can still strike rockets in Kiev, as well as in the area of the capital, many mines and unresolved ammunition.
The chief executive of the Ministry of Defence's investigation warned on 12 April that the Russians are planning the first series of attacks on the territory of the RF in order to accuse Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, Belgrade, Russia’s oil base exploded, as it were, as a result of an air raid by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, Belgrade's local authority claimed that the Ukrainian missile had fallen near the city.
The elite in Washington, D.C., and Berlin, apparently drop into a cold pit from the very thought that the Nazis would destroy Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But the Greens do not speak to them as much as to their voters and societies as they do in general.
By his talks in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the major cities of Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was not available to any of his predecessors.
Greenish does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces European nations that choose those politicians.
And these talks, this brilliant energy, emotion, and time of despair, gradually reach their goal.
While the same Byden categorically opposes the closure of the sky, 70% of its fellow members are already supporting this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is opposed to the speeding up of Ukraine’s entry, the process is already in progress.
I understand you, so you don't want us to be fooled.
The cost you will collect is better than giving to people who need more.
I can come to you and we'll decide where to go.
But the air is clear, that's plus.
There it says that I have a tariff on two without the Internet, I asked you to do the Internet instead.
I don't understand the tariff conditions.

Are you all right with the idea?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan purchases, vacations.

He's squeaking for the old reality.
You're calling at work to find out whether to go out to work today or not.
You decide to leave the child at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There's hope... it's not for long.
Now... there's something going to be.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go? I have no one and nowhere.
I've got 50 bucks in my purse, and we spent everything at home.
Many have been found by the leaders, who have not paid their wages for our work.
Where do I go? Who do I need? How do I get my kids? Where do I live?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't get anything out of the house... you're going 1,000 kilometers.
You don't know how to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you're pushing kids all over Prague.

2. Would you be interested in sharing with your Czech neighbors, your friends, your community?
If so, that's the same type, I guess.
Please send a page with a visa or a stamp (red with a date).
Without a visa for refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian aid.
Mrs. Libushe, did you pay for that?
Because I can't understand.
You are doing us so much good....
We owe you very much... thank you!
Yeah, I understand that's very good.

How Do You Feel From the First Week?
Carina brought us drugs last night, and we're drinking them.
I can work with sleeping sick and disabled children.
But I have to say that I speak only Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have one.

Today we have joy - our town of Bucha has been freed from the siege, our troops have stood.
There's a cleaning out of the enemy-- they're looking for Russians in the basements and in the apartments.
All the city has been replaced, the exchange work will begin.
And John would look, maybe something there needs to be repaired or something else done.
Diano, whatever you want, maybe he'll be ashamed, I don't know.
Our boss wants to stay home, says he's tired of us and wants to stay alone when we're going somewhere without him.
We're going to pick up the masculine and do the lessons.
These are small businesses that were in their homes and shops to preach to volunteer headquarters.
These are the tractors that actually go under the shots in the field, because the time to sow.
These are bus drivers who today agree to go in the vans in temporarily occupied territories to get help there and get people out of there.
These are heroic leaders who fearlessly drive in the war zone, calm down and help the fugitives in the wagons, and at peaceful stations help volunteers to load the ambulance.
These were the drivers who were standing on the Vitomir trail on the first day of the war and patiently served the frightened and nervous people.
These are power stations that export garbage, repair pipelines, and power lines to ensure that people are needed.
They are doctors and nurses who save people in 24 hours a day, not complaining about anything, but in a free moment still volunteering to collect the pharmacies on the front.
We're in Ukraine, we're out of sugar when the little ones are leaves.
Please tell me, little children, what age do you mean?
My daughter, 8 years old, is that a good age?
I'm looking for a room for my daughter and me for 3-4 days to come to the Czech Republic and pass passports to train in Canada.
In Warsaw, there's a lot of people in the business center and they don't work online.
I wanted to come one day, but this is far away, it takes a lot of time on the train, the child will be hard.
So I decided to search for a place in Prague or near it.
No, we're all set up.

Now I'm on the phone with all the people I know from Lviv, and a lot of people are dead.
The Czech Republic began to issue a visa after March 22, in my opinion.
Before that time -- put prints like this and then compared these prints to the visa.
The Ukrainian Foreign Electoral District (ZWO Ukraine) is a electoral district that brings together the electoral units located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of polling facilities in Ukraine's embassies and consulates and military bases abroad, where Ukrainian peacekeepers (Kosovo and DD Congo) are located.[1] The role of the District Electoral Commission for the Foreign Electoral District is carried out by the Central Electoral Commission.
In the Foreign Electoral District, only national voting takes place: the election of the President and of the people's MPs and the entire Ukrainian referendums.
Local elections are not conducted in the U.S.

So that would be good, but I know there was no free space, and in principle they now have all the lessons of schedule and they teach quite well.
Do you have a piece of meat to make a pie?
All right, let's go after the big day.
Did your mom tell you something hurt yesterday?
She can't tell them everything she wants, and she doesn't understand everything they're saying.
She went to school today too.
Today I saw Christine’s mother, but she didn’t even say hello.
What kind of apple is that?
The head of President Andrey Ermak's Office reported that Russia is starting a "feak operation" on the weapons that the allies are handing over to us.
Hermak's direct language: "They understand that they're losing the war, they see their distance, and they want to "kill" the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the last feikas is the brutal destruction of the Slovene of CRIC C-300.
This information has already been clarified by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
We know Russian scenarios, I'll call one of them.
They can launch the faikas that Ukrainian soldiers bout themselves with weapons from allies, and it goes to the Russian army mass.
I want to warn you right away.
Because the weapons in the hands of the U.S. soldiers are exclusively sending the enemy to the world.
I'm sorry, but I forgot to ask you how much bull to cost a garden a month, and is he going to work in the summer?
Each one is given by force.

Thank you for having responded and I want to find you a good assistant.
Your father may have told you that there are Jehovah’s Witnesses among us, but I don’t testify to any religion.

At the end of each description, you have contact with the owner.
You can use this online translator from Ukrainian to Ukrainian and vice versa.
I can't even walk in the room, thank you very much.
Well, did you click on those links that I sent you above?
On each of them you have a free offer of your home, a description, a contact with the owner and a photo.
I can't find a contact just an e-mail. Unfortunately, I don't have anything to do with what a place closer to Czech Krumlov has in our work in Czech Krumlov and now we're living in Prague.
Then I'm not going to help you.
Thank you for helping us find a home, but we need a bed and a sofa, you can tell us where we can buy a cheap budget because we have a weak budget, thank you very much.

The international co-operative continues to express shock and anger after evidence has been shown that the Russian forces have committed atrocities against the peaceful population in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these messages as a “provocation. ”
"Reports of the killed, raped and severely injured by the Russian troops of Ukrainian peacekeepers are worth condemnation," New Zealand Prime Minister Jasind Ardern told reporters in Wellington on 4 April.
"Russia should answer the world for what they have done," she added, pointing out that her government is discussing additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kissed called incidents "a violation of international law".
After reports of hundreds of peacekeepers were shot and thrown into brotherly graves or left on the streets of the suburb of Kiev, in Buchi by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
Photos of the bodies of civilians who have been killed with their hands were shocking to many and called for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in a radio interview on 4 April that there were signs that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Buchi.
"What happened in Buchi requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Makron said, adding that additional sanctions should be directed towards Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanches said Russian troops could go so far as to make the "genocide" in Buchi.
"We will do everything we can so that those who have committed these war crimes will not remain innocent," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on public television late April 3, Russia’s U.S.S. spokesman Maria Zacharov dismissed the charge as a “provocation. ”
She said, without evidence, that the United States and NATO "prohibited" the image to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minute after these materials appeared does not raise any doubt as to who has "procededed" this story," Zacharov said.
Formerly, Russia's Mino Defence also stated without evidence that Buchi's image is "one more order of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian armies left the city by March 30th.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on 4 April to discuss what it called "the provocation of Ukrainian radicals" in Buchi.
On 4 April, Russia's next committee issued a statement declaring "research" on the charge of Ukraine's spread of "indiscriminate information" on the actions of Russian troops in Buchi.
The president of Ukraine, Volodymir Zelenski, spoke on 3 April, accusing the Russian troops of committing genocide in the city, and told the Kremlin leaders that they had to come to Buchi to see what their troops had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out," said the Greens on video, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there's a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for the shooting in the morgue," he said.
He stated that Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and the Russian troops should bear responsibility for the actions of the armies in Ukraine.
"When we find people tied to their back hands and heads, I don't understand," he said about the scenes of the victims scattered on the streets of Buchi, about 35 kilometers north-west of Kiev.
On April 2, the correspondent of the Ukrainian Service Radio Freedom saw the streets of a small city of the body, like civilians.
Only in one place did the correspondent see up to 10 bodies on the street.
The AP journalists saw at least 21 people in different locations in Buchi.
The bodies of one group of nine people -- everyone in the civilian -- were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to locals, used Russian forces as a base.
It seems that the victims were killed from a distance.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities stated that at least 410 peacekeepers were found in the Kyiv area, which was controlled by the Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, everything is, we bought everything on the list.
"They told them that Kiev was gone." How the crews drove Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
Russian invasions in Ukraine are accompanied by horrendous acts of robbery, rape, murder, and torture.
There is another point in this list that is now much less information — the export of the local population to the territory of the enemy.
About mid-March, Russian crews "evacuate" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied occupied settlements in their territory and in the territory of Belarus, which the self-declared President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military police.
"Ukraine truth" has been searching for exported Ukrainians and their relatives to inquire about how the evacuation is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
This text has been applied to voluntary and forced evacuation outside of Ukraine under psychological pressure and incessantly.
Fortunately, they are alive and maintain a relationship with their family.
However, in view of the Ukrainian authorities ’ statement, many citizens were deported to Russia and Belarus under strict pressure.
So in Melitopolis, the Russians stole the staff from the second post office, drove the children out of there without their parents, including 12-year-old Miroslav, the daughter of the Ukrainian dead champion from the Josip Zachinski swimming.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter, Vali, moved to Hostmel in a few months before the war.
Alexander himself got a job at Antonov Airport, located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled in the territory of the military town, although it was civil.
As real plastics, Denis and Marina had previously collected alarm bags, but in the morning of February 24th, they couldn't escape.
They had no car, and the primitive buses had not taken anyone.
About 12 o'clock on February 24th, they saw the helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first planes.
One of them was involved in a neighboring house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three weeks until March 17th, until the Russian troops took them to Belarus.
About 40 people were buried in their basement.
Not all of them made up their minds.
"On the 6th of February, people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian came to the subway.
They say, "Who is there?" I say, "Come out."
They were looking for me, asking who was in the basement, whether there was a weapon.
All the men were asked if they were serving in the army.
They said to the women, "We have come to protect you by order of Ramzan Kadriv."
It was a Chechen OMON, not even an army, young boys of 25-35 years old.
They said, "There were Ukrainians helping us in the war, Sasko Billy (commanded by UNA-UNSO's Nationalist Movement Viking, who fought on the side of the Chechen in the first Russian-Chechen War, U.S.A.), now we're here to help you."
On the third day, they asked what was not enough for us.
We say that the water was a big problem with her.
They broke the store, took the goods out of there and brought us six bottles.
There's still an online video where kids thank Kadirov for his food.
So they brought in a cowboy after they stole the store and they said, "We understand it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Ahmatovic."
Nobody especially wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, "You have 7 days to give up our phones," they laughed.
Still, they kept separate from the Russians.
They said how good they came, because they didn't want the war, and the Ukrainians supported it, and they said, "Potiny is a bastard, so are the Kadirs, but we can't do anything, because there's our families."
And most of the time, they didn't fight, and they drove to grab stores, and they were in a state of shock.
The courier got lucky, tied to one leg of a Georgian strike, and to the other, his white jump, and called it "a cop."
They arrived in Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their investigation worked... when they were shot at Buchi, so that they didn't even take the killed, they asked us, "What do you have, artillery?"
Moreover, we had a contrived runoff — the scissors didn’t know each other, asked for passwords in the first days to find out who they were or what they were.
They were with us until March 13th, after which the Russian OMON arrived, and behind them was the ossuary desant.
They put 30-40 units of technology between the houses -- ours always fell into it with the "Biraktars."
But they came and told us that the U.S.U. is no longer there, but there are "Azov" and, according to them, "Azou" so thousands of 100 in Ukraine.
"Cyev's been surrendering" came from the beginning of March.
One day, a Russian official, or a dissident, or a FSB representative, came to us and said that there would be evacuation.
And we listened to the radio -- there was the noise, the Hostmel, we thought maybe we had a green corridor.
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But they say, "You're being exported to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We're saying we don't want to go there or there.
And they said, "That's a pity for your children's mentality!"
As it worked out, they threw us into the basement and started shooting us from under the house -- either the "Citys" or the mines.
And then it flew back... the neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our home had a direct impact on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us to Belarus only, promising to transfer to the Gentiles and to the Red Cross.
The part didn't go, saying it was for the traitors of the homeland, saying, "You're being shot there, the organs are being sold."
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road was hot, a broken technique, although the Belarusians told us that the Russians were driving them right away.
There's a lot of carpets, buried equipment, and soldiers.
At the Belarusian point of the "Comor" pass, we went through improvised control, and many people were completely undocumented because they burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given a cup of tea.
And this is where we hear the shooting, and it's a missile shot, and it's obvious that it was working on "Iscander" in Kiev.
Although those of the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, they fly, they fly, they turn on the border."
But we're from aviation, we have education, we understand that.
We were later taken to the bus and taken to the Chunky Sanatorium near Gomel.
His boss, Wenger Vasil Stepanovic, said, "Here I am, hiding, I'm from Montenegro.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko won't stop until they get these holes.
The poor people are suffering!
And we've got Lukashenko so good!
He will say, and so will he."
They offered to interview Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The sanatorium administration told us, "You're already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and UN representations (at least they were called) were spreading disinformation that men in Poland could not go.
Many believed in it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though there was a problem with the documents — the daughter had no foreign passport.
We had to get it on Monday, and the war started on Thursday.
There was nothing we could do at the Ukrainian consulate, and in Minsk, the train station said that no one would take the bus without the passports.
I'm going to say that we've had a lot of help from the Belarusian volunteers.
We were both settled in Minsk, and the escort was carried out.
There was no force in the sanatorium.
Our second group migration representative said that you can spend the maximum week-five here, because Belarus is not Europe, there is no payment here.
We found an internal carrier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
As we traveled by Mozira (about 50 km from the Ukrainian border — U.S.), we saw the launch of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the missile is first flying, beautiful shining, and then it is extinguished.
People sitting on a bus in Mozira told me that the Russians were constantly shooting from the polygons.
But I can say that the Belarusians don't want to fight at all.
The generals are released from the army.
One woman told us that she would break a son if they called him.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk does not believe at all.
They say, "You're lying, we're a peaceful people."
They don't understand that their cops are using them to shoot Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting for us to be taken to Estonia.
Now we're going through the registration, we're going to decide what we're going to do.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are now, of course, as much as Estonians."
Marina lived on the territory of a military town in Hostomelia with her brother’s family, his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years of age.
On February 24th, she called the tribes and asked them to collect the most necessary items and documents.
At night they went to the basement of a neighbor’s house.
Mariana herself could not return home, and she could not, in principle, be gone.
No one knew anything about evacuation.
And on Monday, you can't go somewhere in the center?
Thank you, we have everything. And we're always waiting for you in the guest room!

The Koran says: “Even a leaf from a tree is known to fall. ”
We have kids studying online, which is a salesman and cook, but I can work in the fields and the laundry, i.e., a Maryan specialist from the production of yours, she can work at home, and a Maryan friend has no specialty, i.e., a variety of things.
Can we decide how best to do that?
On April 1, Buchi City’s head, Anatolio Fedoruk, announced a joyful message — on March 31, Ukraine’s troops released the city from Russian invaders.
The following day, the bandits were expelled from all over Kiev.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians should have felt at this time was blinding the fear and hatred of the people, for at the same time it became known that only the Russians shot at at least 280 peacekeepers.
They were just killed on the street, some tied their hands and shot in the waist, some of the killed were minors.
Killed and followed by torture, the old village of Motijin Olgu Suhenko, her husband, Igoria, and Alexander’s son, was stolen on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the brotherly grave, Igoria, in the sewerage.
Both trails were discovered within 20 km of Kiev by a number of women dressed in blankets.
The Russians tried to burn them.

I've been talking to you very often, and I think you're hearing my thoughts.
President Volodymir Zelenski stated that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners were too late.
He said that in an interview with the Associated Press, published by the President's Office, he writes "European Truth."
"All the equipment, all they're sending, for some kind of equipment it's done late.
So, for example, when we talk about Mariúpolis, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, that's really right.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," said Green.
On the question of this, enough weapons were given to Ukraine to make a difference in the war, the president said, "No, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a NATO member, this war would not be, or it would have a different appearance.
"She would have opened up, we'd have close neighbors' arms, we could fight together.
But I'm sure the wars wouldn't have been," he added.
Remember, the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, including weapons and anti-fraud weapons.
I have a dream that the war is over and I come home.

He asked me to just talk to him and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man, and he thought I might be his toy and I might need his money.
And then he made me a proposal.
"I had a car in my yard, on a crocodile like that, and I was dropping my chests.
And they kept me in the house, then took me to the basement, and there were a lot of people, about 400 people, breathing was nothing.
What about the house you took the picture from?
I haven't really gotten there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already defended this fact.

I don't want anything.
I understand that I can't sit with you. I need to work.
Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 and we don't need any Ukrainian TV.
I see all the news on the Internet.
And 1+1 is a presidential, propaganda channel, it's not interesting to me at all.

"I tell her that the repair of the TV and the radio receiver has been pulled over by the import details, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to screw up when they're on the phone."
"We've been hiding for a whole month from a total war info.
As long as it works.
In Plamka, however, on the pus, and on the back of the blades, it was quickly swallowed — it could be from stress, changes in diet, and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been removed, and this is no reason for stress, unfortunately.

Because Olga has a bad hearing and spends most of her time in her room, her bride month lived in the apartment with her "incognito."
And on April 1, 93, Oxana Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
"33 days I lived with her in the apartment as a partisan.
The war was also hidden from her, and what I was about was as formal as always for a few hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her a reception – she listened for 4 hours, then she sang for 2 hours."
The radio receiver was always at bedside.
Most of the time, the wicker spends in her room.
He doesn't hear it, he let me be unobservable to her.
If I heard the sound of her walkers, I hid in my room.
First, she hid the receiver and the TV.
And then she called everyone who was talking to her, and that's 6-7 people.
She asked her to talk to her about anything but war.
I'll ask my friend, she was there from the beginning and to the end

A British man in the U.S.U. who defended Mariúpol says he's willing to surrender to the Russians
A British military officer from the U.S. Navy Brigade, who is involved in the defense of Mariúpol, told his friends and family that they were armed and would surrender to the Russian army.
Source: twitter-page Adyna Aislin, a British who served in the U.S.A.L. since 2018, the U.S.A. with reference to family members and friends Aislin, Atlas News with reference to the words of the friend Aislin who spoke to him
We received a message from him, saying, "It's been 48 days, we've tried everything we can to protect Mariúpolis, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian army.
We had no food and no ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will be over soon."
Details: Aislin served in the 36th individual U.S. Marine Corps Brigade, which is involved in Mariupoli's defence operation.
Journalists of the U.S.U. were in contact with the mother of military servant Ann Wood, and she confirmed that her son had reported on her phone that they were planning to surrender.
A friend of the military, Brian Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in the last telephone conversation, Eislin spoke about the plans of their capital division.
According to him, the brigades ended up fighting and food.
Journalists of Atlas News contacted his friend, who said Aislin's division was about to surrender to the Russian sub-sections so that they wouldn't get a gun and a bullet in the hands of the so-called "chadrons."
Also in the sorceress, the audio recording of a telephone conversation seemed to speak to a well - known American friend who is planning to go to Ukraine.
In a conversation with Aislin, they said that they were trying to get out of the city in civilian clothing, but they failed.
The British once told him that in Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Ashlin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to participate in a fight against terrorists called the Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018 he officially joined the U.S.A. and made a vow.
Aisla's friends and close friends were called Johnny, and he's more famous in the sorceress than Cossack Gundi.

When You Can Bring Things
You have a very interesting tradition, we're going to Christmas like this.
Last week, the Supreme Council approved Bill 7176, which has the title "The impact of monitoring potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economy".
It's amazing that in fact the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the field of economics was... the place where the members of the Supervisory Board are sitting.
Initiators of the bill believe that taking decisions by the supervisory board of the company in the condition of Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of Ukraine’s national security.
We are aware of the large number of new dangers to the maintenance company, but we do not know of any company that has a physical need to hold a supervisory board at the location.
The potential danger from such a law has been understood as a great basis for all acquisitions of hard-to-reform entrepreneurship after the Revolution of the Ages, including independent supervisory councils, and then for manual management.
That was before 2015.
Why and who should be involved?
What is more, if under the patriotic slogans one harmful bill goes, others can fly tomorrow, for example, the state procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NGO.
There's a lot we can write for the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and the 7176 bill.
So on February 22, this rule was added to the parallel table of Bill 5397.
In general, the desire to disfellowship the supervisory board in some way has been circulating among some peoples for a long time.
Instead of being critical, we will be able to understand the arguments that explain the need for its adoption.
And then we'll make our proposals on how to resolve the issue of management of post-war business.
The Prime Minister of Economic Affairs Denis Kudin explained the need for this innovation to risk losing the Internet and other means of communication that would prevent the remote work of supervisors.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board cannot make the necessary decisions, as far as the company's work is concerned.
Do we agree that such a risk exists, but can he prevent the movement of members of the supervisory board to Ukraine?
Let us imagine a situation in which independent members of the supervisory board (which make up the majority of the entire board) put their personal security above the company’s interests and refused to come to Ukraine.
In such a case, they may be released according to the bill.
And then, more quickly, it will lead to the loss of the quorum needed by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to appoint new independent members of the supervisory board quickly, since the law provides for the need for a competition that takes on an average of 3-4 months.
So the decision proposed by Bill 7176 could not, rather, prevent the loss of the supervisory board from making decisions!
National MP, author of Dmitro Nataluha's bill, gives other arguments to his support.
In particular, he notes: "Many companies, such as the OPC, now need relocations" and therefore, "it's hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vienna to Zoom."
For the first time, there are almost no OPCs in Ukraine, which have supervisory advice.
The supervisory board is a failure in the Ucro-Defense, which essentially manages almost all OPC maintenance operations.
But even in the "Ukraine Prom", according to legislation, the supervisory board has quite limited powers, and all of its members perform obligations not on a free basis.
The entire power of the Ucrooborome is a director-general, who will make decisions about the need for a relocation of an OPC undertaking that is part of the Concrete.
Moreover, such an argument does not stand in the way of criticism even because Bill 7176 does not at all make any changes to the legislation governing the activities of OPCW.
Mr. Dmitro, on his Facebook page, also cites the arguments that can be referred to the "emotional" category.
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of maintenance companies and banks, but let's try to figure out some of them: "relevant foreign experts leave Ukraine in the very first word "war" in 2021, but they remain members of the supervisory councils in Ukrainian state companies with a full salary of several hundred thousand victims, while Ukraine itself is actually suffering from war."
First of all, it's manipulation -- most of these supervisors never lived in Ukraine, and they came here on a regular basis.
So to say that they're leaving Ukraine, gently saying, unfairly.
Secondly, as a result of the pandemic of the Crown virus, both foreign and Ukrainian supervisory councils have long been able to practice online meetings.
This tool has long been widely used in the world’s practice, and in a wide range of fields: business, education, medicine, and so forth.
It should also not be forgotten that membership in the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
As a general rule, such people have other jobs, and that's exactly how electronic communications help them.
Third, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dmitro not make identical claims to members of the supervisory councils who are Ukrainians?
Because they do not have a place to find their own companies.
In short, this is not the first populist attempt of the MPs to remove foreigners from the supervisory board, and the war is just a new convenient opportunity.

The Kyiv area, which was released from the occupations, will be held in Bravoorsk, Wiesborg, and Buchansk, a two - hour commandant.

These cities and the forces of limitations will operate from 21:00 on 2 April to 06:00 on 5 April."
Details: According to the head of the bulwark, it is categorically prohibited to stay on the streets and in other public places, to move by transport and to walk.
Citizens can go out on the street only when they are alarmed to go into hiding.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression — to clean up and exchange territories.
Omeljanuk called on people who had left these areas to stay away from home.
In the rest of the Kyivčina territory, the day-to-day time will last from 21:00 to 6:00.

In the media, Belarus reported that on the night of March 30th, three Bobruisska residents were detained, one injured, with the support of SBR specialists.
According to the Springs, while men were being held in custody, they were actively resisting and trying to escape.
Security forces were using weapons.

US bans investment in RF and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, impose new sanctions on the daughters of President RF Putin, the largest banks of RF Alpha Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
The report on this is on the White House website.
Sberbank is Russia's largest financial institution, owned by the government, and Alpha-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any assets they have on the U.S. financial system, and will ban US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States has completely banned new investments in the RF.
To that end, President Joe Byden will sign a new order that includes a ban on new investment in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on an approved decision of more than 600 transnational companies to leave Russia.
The output of the private sector includes producers, energy companies, large-scale traders, financial institutions, and other providers of services, such as legal and consulting companies," the White House states.
The third step in the United States' new sanctions has been the restriction on large Russian state enterprises in the critical area.
This will prevent US citizens from operating with these organizations and freeze any assets they have in the jurisdiction of the States.
Minfin's detailed list will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin's children, wives and daughters of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including the President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedi and Prime Minister Michael Mistytin.
The sanctions are derogating from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

We don't have harmful habits.
We will be grateful for such help in such a difficult time.
After lunch, I had one lesson in English, and after that, I went to work in the children’s room.
I explained to Margarita how to fill out all the papers.
I hope she understands everything and works well.
I also met Mrs. Lena and talked to her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She made a announcement from the pool.
It's free swimming.
You can call school, Kira doesn't take the phone, doesn't answer, I don't know if she came to school.
They isolate the Russian office: they stop investment and stop supplying.
However, we did not understand.
There was no military in our home.
Our house is near the military and the oil base
He just helped me because I couldn't do it myself.
I prepare well, do not ask too much and give good advice
I'll take care of it.
It's kind of hard for me, but I understand I have to go through this stage.
We'll meet on Thursday, and I'll tell you everything.
It's all right in general.
I'm just kidding how often you clean up.
I clean every week.
I'm sorry, I don't have a program, but I'll try to figure it out.
I Wanted to Be a Teacher
My girls can't go anywhere right now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you that if you heard about the living information, I'd have to know.
I'd be happy to rent a house with a decent girl.
If you can know that, let me know.
On my side, I'm not going to give up.
Thank you very much.
I haven't written you another person in 54 years. Please write the exact address and the cost of courses.
I think you better make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I didn't change the name, it was one of my births:)
I'm sorry I didn't see you, I'll do it now and I'll send you back.
We're going to the medical commission right now.
I mean, it's time for Ani to work the next day.
Which day would you prefer to come earlier? (What day may be a little more work?)
I'm hearing tomorrow, the Internet works bad.
You're happy to do what you're gonna do.
Thank you... for finding something from things, but there was nothing from technology...
Both beginners, except abbots don't know anything
There's nothing going on.
May I have Monday, 25.04?
Children can be taken with them, the toy here is enough :)
Guessed about Dad.
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'm thinking of something with that money.
We'll do it sometime.
But as this will be paid, please, no credit.
Write me straight, and I'll help.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
You need to take the clothes they gave you?
It's not my day. It's broken in the living room. In the morning, it's the other night.
Something has come from you, I can't see what
I’m also very sad
I'll remind you of the invoice later.
Do you just have a father speaking and understanding Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to clean the house, and how many houses have windows?
I'm ashamed I'm distracting you from your business.
Good evening, I can't share with you.
I'm going to read Joe Dispens, he's doing scientific research on the impact of external factors and the formation of new neurons.
Natalia Nagorna, a TV journalist, published a 12 April video in the morning, which was handed over to the 36th Marine Corps in Mariopol.
In it the soldiers say that they have no weapons left to participate in battles, and the mountains of the wounded.
They said, "The bill goes for an hour."
Prior to that, on 11 April, the 36th special sea brigade that participates in the protection of Mariúpol published a Russian address to the Ukrainians.
The statement stated that April 11 could be the last fight for the defenders of Mariupoli, and the Ukrainian military command was not tied to the fighters for two weeks.
In so - called sorceress, it was said that the application was published in Russian.
The Chief Commander of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Valerie Załujny assured us that the command with the Defence Forces in Mariúpolis is a link, and the details of the defence operation should not be the subject of a public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters in the Azovstal plant in Mariopol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian crew dropped Mariúpol’s poisonous substance of unknown origin.
According to Asza leader Andrei Billecki, the RF army has used chemical weapons against the Azovstal plant, which maintains the battles of the Azov team.
Thank you, I'm going to settle down under you, that'd be very good.
The situation is the same as we're staying here.
( 2 hours driving )) walking, mom in the shops and back!)
It's not a big deal.
She forgot what she'd do here.
The Czech drone squadrons from today began flying over Ukraine.
Nearly 50 professional copyists will serve to detect, and especially to direct the destruction of an enemy predator.
Two Zakarpatian and two Czech “birds” were sent to Ukraine in the evening because of the MP of the Mutachev Mistriud Vladimir Labutenko.
Today, their intern friends at the head of the village council and the coordinator of https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/Vasily Štouram delivered the drones for destination: they were given special divisions of the Ukrainian army in various cities where fighting is currently taking place.
With the aim of maximizing the efficient and safe use of Copteres, their placements will be kept in the secret immediately.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop, say: In the near future, many more interesting “gifts” will be sent to Ukraine to serve the destruction of the Russian army and the preservation of the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I love sweet, but I can't do it without it.
I'm afraid we won't make it.
I'll be right back to Ukraine, keep working.
If it's okay, I'll agree.
I'll try myself, but if there's a problem, I'll write it to you if I can?
The Key to Understanding One Another
We were personally in the old lady in the village of Job, she saw me and that I was pregnant, but she said that there was no one.
Maybe she'll be happy and she'll get her mood up.
I was being repaired today.
And I think I'm still on the street today.
I've had medications and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm sorry too, but I'd rather meet you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, take off the music you like.
I'm curious about the musical abilities you have.
Mom and Dad Should Be Obedient
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's knee.
Today there was colder and rain, and tomorrow must be warm.
But there's no harm done to ruined homes, to the people who are being abused.
In Herson, the crews were recognized as the "Slava Ukraine" memorial in Herson on the street of Prescopsky.
Details: It is noted that the unknowns broke the flag of the European Union, burned the panels with photographs of the hundreds of skyscrapers and killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The bandits broke the portraits of the heroes of the Sky hundreds and the deceased participants of the Russian-Ukraine War.
We've got a flag.
Good morning, thank you to the kids for the dress, we don't have that custom, so we didn't know if the kids were just chocolate and cooking, maybe there was something else to give.
In Czech, there's someone to talk to, if that's all.
Because I live a guy in a gang where twelve people are going to be here, and then they're going to work.
Hello's a little better.
He's already been on his way.
Even today, he's been sleeping there.
That's why we're making great progress.
I'm gonna have to bring the mercenaries together!
I don't have the power to do them this morning.
Since I've been pushing away from the days and the time I've been working to clean up the apartment after the guests, I can say about April for a month because I already have an approximate schedule of cleaning the apartment.
By May -- I can say about the end of April or at the beginning of May.
She just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hi, I'm sorry I haven't been writing dinner in a while, and I'm a little sleepy.
If you don't mind, could I come today?)
or we'll meet you after your arrival)
He's modest, he's been learning a lot lately.
Hello, everything went very well.
I was a little shocked to work with people in such a high position.
Today, we have a small lesson with a lady who is the head of the Economics Department of the Country of Height.
She was very pleased with my work.
A sin in his bosom was good for him.
On Monday, I have to get confirmation of employment as well as a cash payment for cash.
I've been running since Friday.
I don't do anything but much to them and sleep (and drink a lot of water)
If I go to the doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you if I can.
I'm going to bring in another analysis.
You don't have to go again.
It's very bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's got to be done.
That's enough.
Can you send me the right e-mail address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language you've written to.
And are the children to be brought there?
And now for a minute you can go in there's one question.
If you still need help, write it down.
If I'm not wrong, you're celebrating the Passover today, right?
At first, we didn't really want you to make money, so people wouldn't think we were speculating on it!
But for online filling, I didn't have two points:
I'll be able to rest. Get some power and energy. Thank you for today's gift.
I'll see the video right now, that'll be good, because the whole family will draw.
The University of Karasin calls on employees and students to carefully verify any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messenger and social networks, audiences and gossip.
Focus only on official information.
That's how you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who lives in Ukraine, also helps the army
I picked up a few pieces of paper for the portfolio.
After the festival, the Internet is to be held.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How I'm being treated on the day I'm out of work is a pass.
Staff meeting: Russia prepares a provocation in the University to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army can succeed in provocations in Moldova's Prenistrov region to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against the neighbouring state."
In effect, "The military forces of the Russian Federation are not excluded from provocative actions in the territory of the Republic of Moldova, in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighboring state."
Details: The opponent continues to create the next group of armies for action on the Slobohan side.
In the near future, it is likely that the crew will try to reinvigorate the attack.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and deliver a special composition, weapons, and techniques to participate in the fighting in the territory of Ukraine.
The training of weapons and military technology is being carried out at the 60th permanent deployment of a single motorbike brigade (Monastericht) of the 5th General Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that the weapons mentioned will be transferred to a temporary occupied territory in the Danube region.
Also, to restore the loss of the special composition of the Battalion Tactical Group divisions of the 36th individual motorcycle brigade (Borze, Zabaikalski) of the 29 GDR Army of the Eastern Military District, a set of military personnel from the designated brigade is carried out.
The particular problem of the enemy is that the driver and the driver station are packed.
The event of the selected special set of permanent deployments is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
The opponent will probably continue to hit the transport infrastructure in Ukraine for the purpose of destroying or getting out of the way.
The designated divisions of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out the task of strengthening the protection of the Ukrainian-Bilorussian border in the Brest and Gomel areas.
In the Slovene direction, separate divisions of the 6th Allied Army and the coastal forces of the North Fleet continue to block the town of Harkow, and the artillery shooting of certain areas of the city takes place.
In the direction of Islam, an air search is carried out to detect the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
For that, the opponent uses the Orlan-10 BPLA.
With the strength of two battalion tactical groups of enemies, he tried to make a move towards the Dmitrovka and Dmitrovka settlement points, and he had no success and went to a previously occupied position.
On the Donetsk side, the opponent's main efforts continue to focus on taking control of the occupied areas of the Safe, ruby, Lower and Novobachmutuk, as well as establishing full control of the city of Mariúpol.
The enemy tried to make a storm of action in the area of the Golden Age, and he had no success.
In the city of Mariúpol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the crews continue to operate storms in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
By means of separate divisions of enemies, the artillery had shot the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of the High Council, Trudolovek and Marjansk.
In the areas of Donetsk and Lugansk, Ukraine's defenders of the past era have been attacked by four enemy attacks, five tanks have been destroyed, eight armed units, six vehicles and eight artillery systems.
Didn't you understand your thoughts?
Of course we're trying to make it, but I doubt it.
And how can you sleep and I'll delay you?
Are you sure you don't mind if I come?
Maybe you just don't want to see today, so tell me, I'll get it.
We didn't watch TV at home, so we don't have to set up 1 + 1 :)
I'm going to turn on the TV just to listen to the Czech language.
I have a monthly tariff package to finish today:)
Can we do this on the phone today?
Buy fabric for hanging, canvas, sewing thread
I understand, I can prepare material in this area.
I'm asking her, I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she's giving us a lot of pies.
We'll meet my father later, necessarily.
I read the release in the Facebook, so maybe Google wrote something like that, I think the phone number is enough.
Good day, we brought the things you brought, but there are things that little ones can bring you in 10 minutes?
I thought about the reason for the job.
If the Director is in charge, I can start working the next week because tomorrow morning before lunch I plan to go to the office to report the documents (if you get it, because very large lines) and on Saturday rain :)
I'm looking for a brigade at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I'm learning Czech to know perfectly, I'm dreaming to work on you.
Friends of old and not very, friends I don’t know personally, friends by spirit and mind.
Now, too, difficult times have come.
During the past month, I have been in touch with many of you.
Your life, which was never easy, turned from one foot to another, as was the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing from Russia.
And many of you have been admitted to feeling guilt and shame because of your country’s actions toward your neighbors.
Because they're giving Ukraine your name.
Some of you, activists, have long been at risk, and you are preparing for a decisive blow.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from the Memorial.
Let’s talk a little later — as usual, Sasha responded laconically.
Others — cultural actors, artists, critics, writers — are impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be open: except for the very few of you -- those who worked in the memorials, in the new newspaper, in the echo of Moscow, in the media, in the organization of Naval and in the other places -- did many of you do anything to oppose this regime?
Unless they're at the meetings when they're still there.
Also read the column of the Russian journalist "Silver to hide, keep quiet"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your lasting indifference to what is happening around you, by your appetite and by your passive participation, which are now likely to be a great burden to your soul and heart?
It wasn't always like that.
In 1990, there was a short period when you had to some extent freedom and democracy -- a disorderly even curved, but real.
But 1991 proved to be no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you are finally so terrified of being sad that you are looking for salvation behind the king's back, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
As many people as he doesn't kill, you still think he's safer.
In fact, mistakes were made.
Instead of grabbing and publishing the CDB archives, as the Germans from the stadium did, you took the soul to the Dzerjinski Memorial -- and allowed the CDB to lie down, upgrade, transform and seize power over the country.
When you were put in front of a choice between the country's robbery and the return of the communists, you failed to fight for the option of the third option — and you were humbly reconciled to the robbery.
In 1998, your economy fell, and that meant the end of mass meetings for great social justice or against war in Chechnya.
Life became a major concern.
And then Putin showed up, a young, entrepreneurial, aggressive, he promised to get rid of the terrorists and raise the economy.
Some of you have bought it, but you have voted for it, or you have preferred not to vote at all.
When he started comparing Chechnya to the earth again, most of you were blindfolded to it.
I remember those years well.
I was then working in Chechnya, helping those affected by the travel "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw with my eyes the ruins of the Great, Qatar-Yurti, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on the weekend I returned to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors that I witnessed: the tortures of the peacekeepers, the children who were killed, the soldiers who sold bodies to their families.
You said to me, "Brother, we've already got your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
The answer was, "Friends, it's not my Chechen, it's your Chechen.
It's your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It's your government that's bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."
But no, it was too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then there was an economic rise in the middle of zeros, which was promised by increasing oil prices and Putin’s willingness to look through his finger to the fact that part of the stolen money is left in the middle-class pockets.
Many of you have become well - made, some rich, and even the poorest of you have bought a new home and found a better job.
Prices have grown, but isn't that a disaster?
Moscow was shining out of its belly.
When several opposers were killed — Juria Schkochichina, Anna Politkovsky, Alexander Litvinenka, and others — many of you were shocked and threatened about what happened.
However, the matter did not continue.
When Putin transferred President Medvey's post after two terms, and he took the prime minister's place himself, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When after a few months of the Medwied Russia's government invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or kept quiet.
How many of you have I met in the years to come on the mountain slopes of Hudauri, in the mountains of Kazbegi or in the cafes and in the Turkish lasagna of Tbilisi while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I've got to admit that there's hardly much we've done in the West if we've done anything at all.
A bit of resentment, a little bit of sanctions; but what does it mean that Russia is increasingly violating international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and the internal market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, it was the most important thing.
But by the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin re-changed the seats with Medvey's and planted the president's chair, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went out on a massive protest.
The name of Naval became clear, you didn't leave the street for half a year, and the regime finally felt terrible that it was losing ground under its feet.
Then he hit the answer.
Alternatives were first organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some have been given huge terms.
"And what could we do?"
I've heard it so often, and I still hear it.
"The country is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look what they did two years ago.
Angry by the proselyte president, who fooled their European hopes, they once captured Mayan — and never left him.
They built a tent - dwelling town on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy him, they began to protect themselves by using Molota’s boots, armor, and cocktails.
The police finally opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protestors went into attack.
Many have died, but they have won.
The fugitive became Janukovic, and the Ukrainians returned to democracy, the right to choose leaders themselves and expel them if they did not do their job well.
Maiden did not like Putin very much.
This was a bad example.
So, using a general combination, he took Crimea.
Some of you were opposed, but there was little benefit.
How many of you have been caught!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
From where a new myth was born, many of you who despised Putin and his jokes suddenly returned to 180 degrees and began to worship him.
I find it hard to find a reason, since immediately thereafter we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained with my friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you've been hiding new in books, movies, IKEA catalogues and parks, just like the new ones after the restoration that started in Moscow in 2012, with their benbegams, the common wifi and the hipster coffee.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it's just getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
IDI or something there... even a Moscow editor who released my book on Syria then criticised it in an interview, because I didn't understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least, I drove there and saw myself on the streets of Homs state snipers shooting cold-blooded in my children's peers.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers, who started bombing thousands of peacekeepers in 2015, gained experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Nimeler:
"They first came for socialists, but I spoke, because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came after the trade union members, but I spoke because I was not a trade union member.
Then they came to the Jews, but I spoke, because I am not a Jew.
Then they came after me, but there was no one left who could say anything about my protection."
How many of you have been talking about Czechs, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did it.
But the vast majority spoke.
Some actually speak now — such as Dmitro Gluhovski, Mikhailo Shiskin, Mikhailo Zigar, Maxim Osipov, and others.
Most people allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Oujanykov, risking entering a new GULAG or setting up a Nawal company.
As for others, you know best where you live.
So, I'm sure you understand, when Putin gets married to the Ukrainians -- or if he doesn't have it, he'll marry you.
For all of you, my friends, for those who are courageous but mostly alone have gone out into protests and still have a minor term, but soon he will get more serious.
For a thousand of you who have signed the petition, who have expressed a disagreement in the sorceress (even a black square in Instagram) or have spoken in private talks with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or 25 years of free will were given just for the anecdotes were not so far past — and now they are very likely to be waiting for you in the future.
Who's going to speak for you, who's left?
The example of Ukrainians – even more than 2014 – fears the travel regime: they prove that they can fight it.
And that mind, motivation, and courage can stop him, no matter how overwhelming his advantage may be.
Considering all of this, few in Russia realizes it as well as what war is going on.
But you, my friends, know what's going on right now.
You're reading news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine that you're in touch with.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You know what it's all about.
A good life in exchange for your silence came to an end.
Your election is just a gohma, your laws, if you don't take account of the repressive ones, they don't value more than the paper they're written on, your last free media is gone, your economy is destroyed faster than I write, you don't have credit cards to buy tickets abroad, even if there's any travel left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will require your agreement, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try or go, or you'll get disappointed.
I doubt you'll see another version.
And yet another one remains.
What's the last thing that's going to break this regime.
And you may need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not come from you: because of the economic collapse in Russia, it is likely to burn in the province, in small cities.
When prices fly, and wages are not paid, the people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will go out the street.
Putin knows this and fears these people a lot more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if we go out to meet each city on our own, as it has already happened periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them individually.
Organization and coordination will be required. The crowd will need to be converted to a mass.
You have this great magic tool -- the Internet that can limit the mode, but that's still working and that can be adjusted in almost any circumstances.
The Revival organization has been fragmented, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized.
You're a lot, you're millions.
The Moscow police can deal with 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If there's more than 300 grand, it's going to be shocked.
We have to use the army, but will this army fight Putin when it comes to the case?
After all that he had forced them to do in Ukraine, all that he had caused them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will feel a sense of fear; those who have children will be afraid of them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid of you, too.
For example, in Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what is going on with those who tend to neglect their master, who want not only to demand freedom but really try to get it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will be lost in vain.
Your son's going to throw a joke in a computer game -- and he's going to be arrested; your daughter's going to be angry on the Internet -- and he's going to be arrested; your close friend's going to be mistaken -- and he's going to die in a Syrian camera under police deeps.
This is what has been happening for many years now, and it will only continue to increase by growing and expanding.
So you don't have a choice, if you don't do anything, you know how it ends.
Do cold blood, think strategically, and achieve that.
We were at work on Friday, and we were told that we could come Monday.
We'll be home in the evening
What You View Me as a Press Secretary
Old man, how often do you go to dinner at a expensive restaurant?
Once for a while, I'm going to dinner at a expensive restaurant.
I'll try to explain everything to her.
So we liked it very much, and we wanted something brighter, so this is a better option.
I was in a room where there were a lot of people.
I feel bad, cough, temperature, loss of voice, weakness and head turns
I have to go to that government of work.
We've already done this, but we've been told who registered in the April Stock Exchange only at the end of the month
We need a break on Thursday, we're going to the doctor with the kids.
But at night I wrote a lady who liked your work, and she would like something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for new news from her and I'm going to have to report it.
Working at the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, spending a lot of time and energy.
I had a difficult psychological, responsible, mental job that I was completely disappointed in.
It's a waste of time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am a communicator, but I am also concerned about marriage.
There was a man for whom I had to marry, but he died, a heart problem.
I believe that to create a family, people must love, respect, trust each other.
Right now, I haven't met.
Good morning. Where can you buy a shape in Je chapter to pick up a pasta (paper or silicone)?
All right, thanks for the advice, then I'll put a witness in the poll on Wall.
She's in a state of bed, she's in a little bit broken in a hip, a wheelchair in a position, she's all over the blender.
Mr. Reihard, I'm sorry to bother you at work.
But I have important questions for you.
I went to the playroom in Natalie today, to say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the baby because she said that she had come to look at things and to arrange them in that room with the clothes and Mr. Valerie opened our baby room up to 19:00 last night.
Could that really be the case?
It's working time for the room by 4:00.
And finally, it's our responsibility.
But I don't have a load, I don't have a very weak web page.
Good day, we've got it all right) The bike works, the invitations were filled yesterday, and I was with the seniors before the exam in the gym.
The most difficult time to understand the puzzles from geometry.
On Saturday, Volodymir helped us.
Vika is studying colleges and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
We Are Thankful for Our Home
Yeah, but I thought you weren't full.
We're trying to get as much as possible to the end of the week to figure out
The situation regarding the Russian invasion is a briefing by the head of the Office of President Alexia Arestovic (10.04.2022)
The director of the President's Office reported on the heroic action of the senior army officer in Mariupoli -- he was surrounded and wounded, so he broke himself off with a radio station so she wouldn't get the opponent.
I have a very important question to ask if they're going to help me put on my granddaughter's account for 5 years (bronchial asthma) now in her womb and flu...
