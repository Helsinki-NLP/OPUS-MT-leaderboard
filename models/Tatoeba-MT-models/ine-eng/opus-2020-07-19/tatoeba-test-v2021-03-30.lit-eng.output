The bird was looking for worms.
I'm proud of my son.
Mere got into the kitchen.
I don't have the slightest understanding.
Don't hurry up like that.
Why are you so angry?
There's a lot of words I don't understand.
Could I have a cup of tea?
I have to tell her the truth tomorrow.
My dream is to learn the Todor language in Kazanje.
You're a student.
I'd like to buy a map.
You're gonna have to drive.
Bring your brother with you.
Betty was always able to get what she wanted.
You didn't tell him?
Stay with me, ladies and gentlemen.
She knows exactly what she wants.
Hello.
Did Thomas forgive you for what you did last week?
Good morning, time to wake up.
The baby spent the whole night.
She didn't like life in town.
This size is too big for me.
It won't change anything.
Do what you want.
That man you saw yesterday is my uncle.
I don't like winter.
I gave Tom a chance.
We played the golf without the rain.
What kind of test is that?
He told me his life story.
I decided to be happy because it was good for my health.
I'll wait here until he gets back.
Teacher's teaching.
What do you see?
What do you see?
That's not what you think!
In that shop, you can buy a dog.
He likes sweet tea.
You have to do the same.
It's simple and intuitive.
How many hours a week do you work?
Yes, you do.
They're not helping.
Please contact me as soon as you get to Boston.
She asked me who came first.
Sooner or later, we'll all die.
How long will it take?
It's a shadow.
Where's the German Embassy?
Be friendly.
This rose is wonderful.
But he knew it couldn't continue.
Probably not.
I want it, too!
She sees nothing.
He can't eat anything sweet today.
She's eating.
I'd like to travel around the world.
Do you like Italian?
I've been in prison for five years.
I didn't.
Any universe that is simple enough to be understood is too simple to create a mind that could understand it.
We didn't have to hurry.
Excuse me?
It doesn't matter which team wins the game.
He's running.
This dress is too big for me.
Go and stand by your car.
Bring her some salad leaves.
We're in the war.
She didn't answer.
I've heard that Mary wants a divorce.
Is this an eagle or a doll?
My father's coming home tomorrow.
This mountain is covered with snow all year round.
Never lose hope.

When I was in high school, I was up at six in the morning.
You guys are the best shot.
How can you say something like that?
Be careful!
Obviously you've done this before.
Did you get a letter?
Two years ago, I couldn't play basketball at all.
What's the difference?
You're guilty.
She rejected my request.
What is your priority?
I like Korean food.
I was invited to lunch.
You're still green.
There's nothing here.
You never know what's going to happen in the future.
We're producing cotton-shaped dried.
Everyone likes flowers.
What did you do to deserve this?
Look at the example shown above.
Her car seemed very funny.
I wanted to be a philosopher.
You're not fast enough.
We left the door open.
Can the nine be here?
Why did you call?
They discussed the problem.
If I hadn't received his help, I'd be dead.
He was almost asleep.
I have one brother.
Where did you come from?
Do you like this color?
Isn't it weird that Tom's still not here?
Millions of people lost their lives during the war.
Compare your sentence with that on the board.
She agreed to him gladly.
They need our help.
Did you get Tom's message?
I don't like how he speaks.
I don't know what's going on with me anymore.
I've learned a lot from him.
He killed that guy.
Don't believe (don't wait) too much.
That red hat is old.
He plays golf every Sunday.
Be creative.
I couldn't understand what he said.
Close the door.
I'm always tired.
He's a weird guy.
Go back to your place.
Be friendly.
Isn't that a wonderful morning?
It's at least a story.
I have more and more gray hair.
He turned off the light.
I'm not sleeping.
The sky is blue.
The old woman fell down and could not rise.
They're asleep after the movie.
You can use my word.
I want to talk to your uncle.
You like Tom.
He rarely stays at home for a week.
When would you like to see him?
Thomas began calling for help.
His son's eight.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
Where the hell are you going?
He promised me he'd be more careful in the future.
When did you hear the bullet?
I forgot to buy one head.
I've heard a lot about you.
Don't worry about it now, we're ready to eat dinner.
Italy is a very nice country.
It's an old mess.
Eat the bread!
Although he lives in the United States, Thomas is not English - speaking.
The school is five kilometers from my house.
I gave up my weapons.
Who ate all our food?
I know her bread will be nice.
Please come.
Women change the world.
The pressure on the floor in Singapore is considered to be a crime.
I wanted Mary to love me instead of Tom.
You can sit on the chair.
We need more sugar.
The rose smell filled the room.
Bad luck sometimes.
Tom has already had three cups of coffee.
I don't understand German.
Yes, please.
I'll help you.
You're guilty.
Who are you looking for?
What does that mean?
The apples on the other side of the wall are the sweetest.
What's that?
I'm studying Japanese.
It's pointless.
She had a woman’s head, her body, her birds, and the snakes of the bird.
Tell me how you solved this problem.
Would you like to jump with me?
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't explain what happened there.
I was afraid of heights.
I don't know where to go.
If he doesn't, then let's go.
What's going on with me?
I agree.
Compare the facts.
I'm not hungry right now.
I'll go to France for a vacation.
You can sit anywhere you want.
You're an engineer.
The door opened slowly.
It's at least a story.
Are you involved in any sport?
It's time for you to start a new business.
Let's wait here.
That girl I told you about lives here.
Please just go.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and see the black cat.
His family traveled a lot.
Do you know him?
I don't know whether to turn left or right.
I'll clean the kitchen later.
He came from a small town in the mountains.
I was talking to my friends.
All your cats are gray.
I still remember the times when you and I used to make a living together.
When we go to sleep, we say "good night."
Scandal broke his career.
Cats are difficult for individuals.
He was so poor that he couldn't buy bread.
I suggest you ask Tom.
This bag is not small.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If you invite him, he'll probably come.
I know you know I know.
Go back home before six.
The bread is fresh.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don't want to be a bad guy anymore.
Are you a lawyer?
Where's your school?
The candle lit the room.
I'm sorry.
Take the paper in half.
What does he write in a letter?
The woman ate the meal.
I'm eating apple.
A single person receives pleasure by observing the compasses.
Who is that man sitting at the other end of the table?
Are you pregnant?
Now I'm really tired.
His steps were speeding up.
I'm always afraid of these endless spaces.
What do you need a new shot?
He put a straight line on the wall.
You need a car?
Take your hat off when you get in class.
They don't do anything more than complain.
She was in a hurry.
Please contact me as soon as you get to Boston.
Thomas got up at 7: 00 a.m.
This is us.
Listen to the radio.
The boy wants to know the truth.
Tom ate all the pizza one.
You have to take care of yourself.
You need patience, Tom.
How are you?
Your trip starts here.
Can you believe what he said?
Tom asked where you were.
I'd like to help, but I'm very busy.
Thomas could not stop thinking about Mary.
I think we should call Tom.
Don't be late for the bus.
All the apples are there.
You're gonna have to pay.
When should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
I'll take you to the new store.
Everyone knows her.
She's incredibly naive.
Where do you live in Turkey?
Tom's starting.
I can't.
Get out of class.
Three dogs sleeping on my mother's bed.
Thomas has already completed the work he needed to do.
If you can't have children, you could always get in.
That's what I thought.
Although she was running as fast as she could, she still couldn't make it to the bus.
They need friends.
Please, please.
Can You Convinced Like a Gift?
Do you like living like that?
It's hot today, isn't it?
Don't you really have a home?
Are you playing chess?
Her boyfriend is Turk.
Answer me.
My mother can't come.
There's a lot of idiots in Bavaria.
Do you know if he has a girlfriend?
I don't have a family.
Fathers believed too much of their son.
What would you like to order, sir?
He did it.
He went into my room without permission.
You can't just leave.
Come on, move it!
You can sit on the chair.
Where do you live if you don't have a home?
Our union can be perfect.
He told me I could use his car.
Almost all students like English.
That test was so hard that we didn't have enough time to finish it.
That's all.
You have to work fast.
If you believe that society has created nothing worthwhile, you can say that you believe in massive destruction.
The English language is spoken around the world.
All their efforts were meaningless.
Where are you looking?
This girl doesn't sound so bad.
Life is unfair.
Each person paid a thousand dollars.
Jill is the only girl in our club.
Students don't have to go to school today.
The sun went down over the sky.
His parents were pleased with his success.
Now it's our house.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get home.
He helped fix my watch.
No one's worth helping me with you.
John doesn't know what to do next.

I'd invite her to jump.
Have you done your homework yet?
John is a professor of French literature at Oxford University.
Do you understand what he said?
What color do they have?
The sooner I get back, the happier your father will be.
Are you ready to start your trip?
Your watch is ten minutes late.
They betrayed you.
I thought you said she was yours.
How much money do you have hidden after your bed?
We believe in God.
I'm an airman.
That's the man I've been waiting for.
He didn't pay the debt and started.
Mr. Brown speaks very well Japanese.
No, he's not my new boyfriend.
I like to watch baseball and football.
Everyone, except her, fell asleep.
The queen was standing next to the king.
This bridge was built two years ago.
She's my first love.
You have to keep your promise.
Today, Thomas seems different.
What is the rental price of the room?
We have to get out of here.
Thomas never wants to do that again.
I asked her to wait a minute.
How did you start to learn the languages of those who had the hope of living forever?
They don't pose a threat.
Her advice moved me to move abroad.
You're the only one who can help me.
What places does that tour visit?
That's why we played inside.
Your lift is completely white.
But I don't want to.
I'm sorry I can't meet you tonight.
Tom has a sister who's a lawyer.
I look like my mother.
You look just amazing tonight.
Doctor, can you hear me?
You understand, don't you?
I hope to see him on Monday.
Tom's ready.
Orcaite is hot, so be careful not to stumble.
Have You Found Your Emails?
For God's sake!
He doesn't remember whether that room was empty or not.
The shop sells expensive accessories to women.
I don't like to be wrong.
It's not them.
I don't know how to get up early.
Stay where you are.
The house is hers.
The doctor advised him to stop working so much.
Are you sure?
You've been busy.
I can't live like this anymore.
He'll do anything to make money.
I just want to talk.
What music does Tom like?
That tree grows at her house.
Don't talk at the reading room.
How are you doing, panel?
I've just turned it into a dollar.
I hate winter.
I think Tom's going to kill Mary.
There are only two correct answers.
If I were rich, I'd have given you some money.
When and where did you meet her?
Where the hell did you fuck them?
Tom didn't show up.
Don't be so serious, it's just a game.
He told a funny story.
I don't have time right now.
Tom is the captain of our team.
This slope is very long.
Listen to what the teacher says.
Why doesn't anyone eat my potatoes?
I asked Tom to play guitar.
What does that remind you of?
She translated that word.
What a wonderful night!
I can't find Tim.
She called him Charles.
I'm not sure whether it's a boy or a girl.
Life is beautiful.
She's taking them to school.
Tatoeba was temporarily unavailable.
Nobody believed what you said.
I didn't know what to say.
Do you think I should go alone?
Just answer the phone.
I never want to owe anyone.
Look at the train running through the bridge.
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I'm really tired now.
No, I don't think I'm guilty.
Where are we?
I've got forty-five.
Her car seemed ridiculous.
She's too young to understand.
I bought this suit just this time.
It's like that.
Be careful, okay?
It's the only explanation.
I can't believe I'm really here.
Don't you know the way?
I love it very much.
Tom will need help.
I printed a hundred pages.
I can see and hear.
Don't forget the ticket.
Raise your hand before answering.
Please change the flag.
Isn't it true you have a gun?
I slept in bed all day yesterday.
The war ended their investigation.
When the spring comes, the days become longer a day after a day.
I'm listening to the radio.
Sweet dreams!
Leave my car alone.
This is Tony's book.
I needed to come first.
Thomas only eats what he wants to eat.
Who stole this apple?
He threw his ticket into a movie.
What would you do if you were in his place?
I don't like summer.
Well, what's your address?
She was lying on the bed face down.
African drums are larger than Asian drums.
What I've always said.
He heard him screaming at midnight.
I'd like to get me a glass of water.
He grabbed her hand.
Eat the bread!
If God did not exist, we would have made him.
You should do it yourself this time.
My family was very kind to me.
You don't understand.
It has green eyes and bright red hair.
Does Tom have experience?
She left her seat on the train.
I'm a vegetarian.
You have to go there.
What's the reason?
I don't see anything from here.
Because I didn't have the answer, I wrote it again.
She's standing outside the wall.
Don't trust me too much.
They missed a great opportunity.
Fight for your right.
He's always talking to me when he meets me on the street.
Look at the book on the table.
I've had one beer and I've got a lot of alcohol.
Tom did not think he needed a personal guardian.
Someone opened the door.
Do you have any questions about this lesson?
We saw how she got into the park.
I don't think you're busy.
It didn't look like you wanted those books.
I have a red double.
He's low and heavy.
I want to go to Tokyo.
The trip was distressing.
He's a lot smarter than I am.
Tom still doesn't seem interested.
It's a stormy weather today.
I didn't want this to happen.
He's trying to get out of here.
Like I said, I won't do anything.
After that, there's a small red dog.
Stop them.
Anna likes chocolate very much.
I know Mike likes a bag.
I've got to try a whole bucket for the apple tree.
He died two years ago.
Take a seat in your room.
The cab suddenly turned left.
Yeah, I get it.
I'll be there in ten minutes.
He was guilty of murder.
If you don't go to school, you won't miss anything.
If anything happens, call me quickly.
Would you like to eat some hot potatoes?
Is there any danger?
You're dangerous to swim in this river.
My friends are great.
Gold won't buy everything.
We have enough water.
Who will inherit the throne?
She worked hard.
Don't be afraid of change.
Please open this box.
Is it healthy to eat fish?
My baby wants to talk.
I asked her what music she likes.
There are no mourners.
Was she satisfied?
But he knew he had no choice.
Do you remember this game?
She started without documents.
I'm here a lot.
She kept on speaking.
Mike's not good at playing baseball.
Coupons are often used when travelling in the woods.
Mary is a bookmaker.
Good weekend.
I saw his car through the window.
Are you ready?
I'm glad I'm not a woman.
Stop wasting your time and go back to work.
The more, the better.
Ten years is a long time.
Is that your car?
I can't believe you're still hungry.
To be happy is perfectly normal.
We have to move very carefully.
Did you get Tom's message?
Yesterday, my hand was hurt.
If I were rich, I'd give you some money.
I don't have a computer at home.
My father didn't eat much fruit.
Can you give me a discount?
She kissed me with tears and wanted to have a good night.
My friend's here.
Where do you live now?
The older you are, the harder it is to learn the language.
Thomas doesn't drink coffee, but he smokes cigarettes.
Not all people like dogs.
I'll stay here for a few days.
I feel bad.
Why did you say such a stupid thing?
You can't beat me.
I don't think I could do that.
Is that true?
She's crying.
We'll see the plague.
He's my father.
He doesn't want to wait for you.
He took the family to the zoo.
Tom refused to go to the hospital.
Half the nine.
This car was manufactured in Japan.
Is this your first time in Japan?
Tony was happy.
My father asked me to open the door.
Make him a photo robot!
Your brother wasn't in school today.
Thomas will never abandon you.
I was in Canada at the time.
I made this food myself.
Write a note.
Someone wrote their name on the wall.
Anyone who can turn in the wrong direction will turn in the same way.
They don't have sugar anymore.
I love your daughter.
Tom hopes he'll stay and not eat again tonight.
Someone opened the door.
I'm not your mom.
Why isn't Tom in the car?
My name is Ricardo.
When did you get a telegram?
You shouldn't be in that cabin.
When's the snow going out?
He thought I was so tired.
I think she's not eating anymore.
Either you're with us or against us.
Please help me!
Thomas knows he likes Mary.
I like this music.
She's kicking the dog.
He went to the store, but he stopped at her house.
The snow is moving fast.
We're in the south.
Of course I should read this book.
Tom's not in prison right now.
Tom and Mary went to the museum.
The ship's heading for the horizon.
Good morning, my dear dog.
God blesses those who repent.
I can't work when you're standing there.
Marilie had lung problems.
We were one big happy family.
What color car did she buy herself?
The kid spent the whole night.
Do you see me?
She testified against him.
My father's growing rice.
We speak Japanese.
The result was disappointing.
I got through the window.
Meat is not ready yet.
Give me a piece of bed.
She needs more sleep.
Did you hear anything?
Is she your mother?
Can you turn on the light?
He doesn't trust the doctor anymore.
It was the first time I visited the museum.
We're really wasting our time.
I think Tom wants to sit down.
What a beautiful family.
Are you still in Florida?
You didn't have to eat those green fish.
Get ready! Tomorrow's the last day.
We looked through the window, but we didn't see anything.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
The capital of Sweden is Stockholm.
They were talking about love.
Thomas never wants to do that again.
I don't understand.
One left, the child would feel very lonely.
I don't know anything here.
Our team lacks mobility.
Katie's been through the street.
There's a mirror.
Why don't you help the police?
I want to meet your father.
Please continue.
He was busy.
I'm a virgin.
I saw him.
I'm teaching Liebano.
"Good morning," said Tom smiling.
I'm hurting my hand.
He needs a cupboard.
You shouldn't go.
You shouldn't trust him.
There are seven days in one week.
You have to take your own way of life.
Without air and water, no one could live.
He fainted, and he didn't feel well.
They work eight hours a day.
I'm eating and drinking.
I do it every Sunday morning.
She quickly opened the letter.
Are you busy right now?
I'll take away everything I've said.
Where did you get all those keys?
I went inside through the window.
Get Tom to the hospital.
I have a white cat.
He quickly recorded our names.
Our son died in the war.
It is not satisfied with the result.
Of course you're wrong.
I can't tell you what's going to happen first.
I don't want to talk to you because you broke my heart.
Don't trust him.
We might as well go.
Who is that person sitting at the other end of the table?
This idea is very attractive.
They're going to buy it.
Everything is genius is simple.
Their students learn too much.
Thomas raised his hand.
Let's go get some soup.
Birds leave for the south.
This tea is very nice.
I don't agree with him.
It's my fault.
Not bad, but I'm a little tired.
That's a great idea.
He's very proud of his game.
It'll take us a while.
I wasn't.
A woman wants to know the truth.
Is this word often used?
Lithuania joins the European Union.
I want to be a speaker.
Where's the cat?
I'm sorry for what I did.
She became an ambassador.
I learned to ride a bike when I was six.
He took the piece off the bed.
Let me do it.
I like jazz.
I'm sure he's innocent.
Open the window and introduce the fresh air.
Have you ever given up a dog?
It's very nice.
Have you seen my mother?
I know his name.
Tom doesn't want to live like that.
Do you agree with what she's doing?
He came here before the final lesson.
You know their address?
What the hell are you doing?
He looked down at his purple shoes.
Her cat was lying on my head, and she didn't want to slip.
There are some good hotels in the city.
What's this letter from?
He doesn't want to study today.
We're all different.
You don't know how much I love you.
I wrote her a long letter.
He couldn't do what he wanted.
I feel a little weak today.
Life is interesting.
She's here?
I don't like to be wrong.
Be careful, okay?
I bought a camera for $30.
That's great.
It's no method, it's a provocation.
Answer in English.
He wants to see us again.
The water here is very sequential.
Where do you live?
My friend doesn't use sugar.
I've fallen off the benches.
He learns to call on people.
Bob's been washing his guts at the time.
My brother is two years older than I am, but he's three centimeters lower than me.
I can only tell you what I know.
I'm thinking about you.
What's your home address?
Tomorrow he'll be free.
Have you not seen my wife?
Your daughter heard us talking.
Thomas will die soon.
I'm used to going to sleep late.
I've met him before.
Look at that house with a red roof.
My apartment's fourth floor.
She was pregnant already.
We're basketball players.
These clothes fit you.
Don't blame her.
Do you know you're stronger than you think?
I love her so much that I can't leave her.
Can you come with us?
I don't care.
Thomas could not find a reason why he had to return home early.
Raise your hand.
He didn't sell the house.
No one has ever seen God.
She saw something waiting for her at school.
I don't think you're busy.
Where's Maria?
The new contracts allow us to demand just what we want.
Tom's still a rabbit.
Go and open the door.
I said I'd talk to each other later.
God, help me!
She told him she was happy.
She needs it more than she needs it.
Happy departures!
Tommy, I'm back.
You wanted to see me?
It's not a mistake.
The airport is quite far from the city centre.
You can turn off the radio now.
You can turn off the radio now.
You're a very nice man.
Ankara is in Turkey.
You're a very nice man.
I've been in Boston a few times.
You're a very nice man.
