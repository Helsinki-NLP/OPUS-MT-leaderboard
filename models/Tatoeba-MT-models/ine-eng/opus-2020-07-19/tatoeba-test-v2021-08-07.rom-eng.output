Why do you think Tom thought he'd do it?
Why is it that Tom's camel makes you sick?
Why does Tomés love this animal?
Why does Tom faint to see me?
Why are they a coward to me?
Why about Tom on the couch?
Why did Tom give you a book?
Why do you think Tom's wearing mansions?
Why?
Oh, my God!
But without a word, the veil is torn in two.
Ramosar!
Come on.
Come on!
There's nothing Tomes can do for you.
This is what you tell Tom to do.
And thou shalt say, I have no man upon earth, I have no need of thee.
If you fuck low.
I dare speak to them in private.
The troubus of this holy Toms shores.
You're talking to Thomas Shore.
You've always been there.
You are always ready.
I wish I had a mango.
You know, it's really cool when you see a movie.
