Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament has today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment of the section of the Penal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the removal of the minister's expression, but the parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalty for economic offences at second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison by the alleged signing of an agreement with Russia that was unfavourable for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet final, and the Court of Appeal has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West there were doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Penal Code with which the former Prime Minister was convicted was supported by 147 Members in the vote.
For its approval, 226 votes were required.
Libya's Victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
Remaining to determine who the winner is
As usual in the region, Islamists won the elections, but now it is a matter of diluciating whether it is moderate or radical
The Transitional National Council has brought into force the traditional law, the Shariah law, which we already know in a certain way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off by hand.
Women can already forget to emancipate and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, society, composed of war tribes, will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot even imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is not the only or objectively the best and probably did not agree with the Libyans already mentioned.
It is true that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters will accept the help of the unfaithful dogs gratefully.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, NATO's attacks did not lead them to a U.S. general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each successful intervention.
When winners are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting from which Islamists and our politicians serve to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militaryly.
In this case, locals do not have a problem expelling the "crossed"
But, without occupation, will the oilers get to do with the Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible that no, but it may be that the West can finally assume protection of human rights.
Whenever the Sharia followers don't cross us.
Start a new time of the crisis
France and the rest of Europe go to search for investors
A statistical torbellino has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy has been stagnant during the inter-quarter period, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
The investors are no longer only in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates on economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP increased by 0.5 per cent, France's growth by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries have made public the data of the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3 per cent instead of expected 0.1 per cent), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1 per cent (original data were talking about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year.
However, during the inter-quarter period, gross domestic product (GDP) has been stagnant and, according to the ČSU, the trend towards gradual deceleration in growth of economic development is being achieved.
The results are even worse than the predictions of analysts.
Main events:
Meanwhile, the Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year, but has four months.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and recalculated data, grew by 0.5 per cent.
The eurozone economy and also the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, rose by 0.2%, which is consistent with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2 per cent in the interim.
The interest of their ten-year bonds is 28.45 per cent.
The interest of Italian and Spanish bonds has increased to critical limits.
The problem also begins to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of Czech bonds to ten years are maintained in 4 per cent, although the situation in the area is worsening.
There are voices in Germany saying that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs are classified for the Eurocopa.
They won 1:0 and celebrated the ranking with a premium of 200 million.
The football team meets with the most difficult performance of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Czech and brilliant porter Petr Jiráček, victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck in the second time, was fantastically defending the attacks of the local team, so that it will not miss the European championship meeting.
IHNED.cz followed in detail the development of the party in a detailed report.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also the excellent game of Czech and heroic Jiráček, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated its passage to the European Championship.
Due to the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured of the party were Damjanovic and Vucičić, who had two great occasions passed.
Moreover, thanks to the genius Petr Čech, the eleven Czechs will not miss the European Cup date, so the national football clubs will get about 200 million crowns.
A good offensive game has been given since the first few minutes.
Both teams engaged only in keeping the lines and played nothing more around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, patadones to the other field in defense, exactly what the Czech defense was supposed to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
Their gesture is to express their support for their country's nuclear programme against a possible Israeli attack.
The students were asked to pray on Tuesday at noon before the facilities and then they brought death slogans to the U.S. and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields in Isfahan's Iranian city on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center in which uranium is worked.
They intend to demonstrate that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, according to all the indications, is fighting for nuclear weapons.
Israel is talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students prayed at noon in front of Isfahan's nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose objective would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme, it would be achieved, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isfahan centre, but also the Natanz facilities, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: don't cook and dinner
Over one third of children aged between 9 and 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9 per cent of the school population and obesity to 5 per cent.
Obesity children occur in most families with a life-style that is not healthy, according to current research.
Again, we demonstrate the importance of the environment where it grows for healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as reference.
On the table, obese children are fed, for example, of at least twice as often as children of families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had dinner fried potatoes the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obsity is not a coincidence".
In overweight children's families there is no custom to practice sports, which is applicable to most of the current families, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, have time for physical exercise.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last year's school year and participated in the same nearly 900 basic education children in all of the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the program "The obesity of is not a coincidence", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th course.
A good diet and sufficient exercise in the family are determinants, which significantly reduce the number of children with overweight and even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five daily meals according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, food, Wednesday and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," one of the survey results.
No breakfast but with humid for dinner
Experts warn that, in healthy development, details are also important, which also include, for example, having a fixed time for family breakfast.
In Chequia, however, only 23% of school-leaving families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each cook alone.
But the worst was to find out that in 10% of households nothing is cooked.
Breakfast, however, is the basis for a proper daily diet.
The study shows that insanous fried potatoes are consumed much more frequently in obese children's families.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink daily sweet refreshments (70%).
Generally, more than 40% of the children surveyed are sports, but among their parents, this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Make Your Diet
The next phase of the study enabled selected boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 colleges) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged between the ages of 12 and 15 from the point of view of a healthy diet are very far from ideal."
Among its favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"It is particularly alarming the popularity of sweet refreshments," the final report of the study warns.
As the main food, the palm is taken with the paste and followed closely by the bird's flesh.
In practice, children always reject legume and taste for fish and vegetables very low.
Change to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive fair information.
"In the control group of the participants in the study, who filled the questionnaire after the end of the prevention programme "Obsity is not a coincidence", an important change was made in many cases in favor of the principles of healthy food," the results of the study are indicated.
It calls attention, for example, to sweet refreshments, where many children would begin to prefer normal and running water.
Children would also choose more frequently in the questionnaire poultry meat and fish for main food and would restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals support
In the introductory article, As the stylists learn, I already complained a little about the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences of three field professionals, how to dress with troublesome characters and also a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final examinations, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer an affiliator.
We have studied with the director, Alena, (there is no man in the course) about how to dress a woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the great majority.
Someone is short, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone suffers overweight.
The stylist must know how to visually soften a wide shoulder, extend a neck, or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given certain tricks about how to highlight the body of women of Jennifer López, of huge breasts and chairs but tight waist and at the same time do not dress it in a way too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the belt and the chair is so much that the skirt or pants do not fit, it is worth cutting at least one extra piece of fabric to measure.
No doubt they will not regret it, because the clothes you feel are perfectly unappreciable.
With a measure drop you will feel much better than with one that doesn't stop moving, getting up, dancing in the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothing with folds, ornaments, embroidered or draped.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am happy that I have all week to put all this information in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid with the assigned task, I have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two famous ones, to whom two dresses must be designed: one for the day and the other for the night.
The current aspect, the style of fashion that suits the person in question, must be taken into account.
I've been to call Miranda Kerr, maybe you know the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I cry inside, it's much better for me that, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who will have recently made up a hundred pounds (please, take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gómez.
We have to cut them out of the magazines or search them online and print them, then produce them graphically.
The moodboard, which is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The stylist, therefore, saw not only physically, but also takes care, for example, of the product pages in the magazines (specific topics, such as trends, bags, blankets, etc.).
Of all this, the designer and designer Mario Kameník spoke to us.
But all of this is for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three invited specialists encouraged the Saturday conference with information about all types of bodies.
Honza Pokorny, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to get rid of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same dress in different ways.
The variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such gabardine (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in the classic with cows and shirts, but it also serves to dress the naked body with cotton shoes and photograph it as if it were really a dress.
Or it's enough to pull her up and up her neck to get a completely different image.
"Judge with it," he insisted.
What is more valuable is the following advice: "To start working, you need to know all the rules first."
"Then you can break them," said Jakub.
Finally, I find out why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
That's not about the shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know a stylist has to have more types of clothes on the reserve he wants to photograph.
So for a fashion story that has ten pages (so, ten outfits), you have to have ready, lists to use, at least fifteen.
And also that the photos work in combination with other clothes, all of them different from those used in reality.
All of this has to be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorny assured us that the image and style assume them alone, in many cases half the success.
Just look at Madonna, which is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the picture and the market have made her a world star.
In Czechia, for the time being, there is still no clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even the famous characters also find it useless (I have enough of my skills, my physical aspect doesn't matter so much).
And when someone asks us for our services, we have to take into account that it is very likely that they give us a very different size than their real (lesser).
Then it's just to Google and find out if the journals of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has embellished/delegated, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist not enough to be in fashion, but that he had to understand the outfit.
During his work, he must first communicate with the people he saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
You can value people, you don't need them, you defend their opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify his dress and complete it with beautiful clothes, you can't take everything you had and say, "hugh what horror"".
"Find at least a few things you can weigh and recommend so that someone can put them on," says Mario.
He also showed us that everything must end up in the so-called "placovka", i.e. the work bag.
This is set around the waist and there are all the necessary tools.
They are objects such as tiaras, chitapelusas, or impermissible. There is also a thread of nailon (which serves the stylist during the photo session of products such as pockets or caps), special pins of dressings in front, if this is larger (the pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a sewing game.
In order not to remain in the passive ear and put something into practice, we have learned to wear the sole of our shoes.
Even during the photo sessions in the study, on a flat surface, the ground could be damaged and much more the outside could be damaged.
And we did nothing but wear and wear.
We couldn't touch our shoes with the tires so we wouldn't hurt them by accident.
So he had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me the joy of praising my job without reservation.
The truth is, I don't get very good at these skills.
This is only a small part of all those we have heard during the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that dedicating myself to professional style is not a pink way, but it gives me exactly the same thing people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run competes all over America.
Review
A journey, in principle neglected, is complicated due to a series of improper departures from a routine journey during the morning shift.
To some extent, the expectations were met, but that did not serve anything if, in fact, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new delivery, to which the title is added The Run, raised high expectations even before its external.
I promised that I would give new air to the old race bag Need for Speed and, as a result of the show, it appears as a game that should not end up being a kind of action again without any more.
We are also curious to know how the scenes would be inserted, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As it usually happens in the NFS series, the results did not differ greatly from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in total, points are lost due to absurd errors, which have been appearing in the series for years.
In fact, mistakes can not be called, but they are rather the incomprehensible disparagement of programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has some personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal race throughout America.
You sit on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
From this it is learned that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, one does not even have the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasant to see, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous series deliveries.
So it's nothing from the rest of the world.
But walking through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snowcapped mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races vary from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you will find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
Instead, in the mountains you have to be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each race is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, try to advance to a number of required rivals (normal in a classic race), then try to earn time (classic timed duel) and then expect a duel against one opponent.
In the midst of all of this, the police sometimes appear, which doesn't but make things more difficult.
Newness is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are quite fewer landscapes in the game of what should be expected (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not get upset and, in the context mentioned above, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the tracks of the previous episodes.
That means that today is no longer a big thing, but you can't claim it to be bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can already search elsewhere.
But a race designed with a lot of action is quite suitable for this driving style, although we can find something better among the competition games.
So far, everything's fine.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same doesn't happen with collisions anymore.
Of games of this kind you can't expect to create complicated deformations and collisions, but actually before a blow against any object, you can't predict how your car will react, so not everything is in order.
It is typical that, when making a very adjusted advance or circulating the car with a normal traffic, there are only slight rocks, but in other situations almost identical, your car ends up making uncontrolled pirates.
The even ends completely destroyed.
Thanks to the resettling system, there are no big problems, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed in such a way that when you suffer an accident or get out of the track, the game restores you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each career only five resettes are available.
If I consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's only a help in case something's wrong, but it's not much to trust.
Sometimes, not even the resettling helps, only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Sometimes you will find "civil" vehicles on any site always with the same configuration, even though you are the first, fifths or you will arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes you angry, especially in situations, when you see two cars going to meet in opposite directions, your opponent progresses without problems, but when you arrive, you have to turn around or stop well.
It's the same when you get here, because it's programmed because the "surprise" will always happen in front of your noses.
The opponents also have another advantage.
During the game you will reach places where, without taking into account the moment, you will always get the same opponent on the same site.
This also happens at the end of the game, in a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When you go in front of you, it's hard to see the cars coming forward, so at first you can make the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but execution is so apparent that you will probably be disappointed immediately.
And it's a pity, because even though the travel model is simple, the game is fun and actionable, so it's often not possible to follow the detail of what happens or where.
And it really does the same, whether the merit is carried the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the classification in the race so that it doesn't waste the boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to change cars during the race.
You have to be careful about the gas outings next to the road, because right there you have to change your car, although in most cases you will have enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and exotic superports for a technical driving, for example, by mountain roads with curves.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a series of parallel challenges, i.e., there are races in specific places that you will know about history.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
On reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending up with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog function has been connected, comparing your results with those of other players and providing other community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is done.
With the car you reach the metro tunnel (passe), where you run to dark through the roads (passe).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (passes) and, suddenly, the train of the metro arrives behind you and takes you forward without further delay.
In the editorial we will certainly have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought even a little or if the real authors take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most of the pleasant cases, sometimes to the superimposed.
So how sad it is that, in the most tense moments, the image quality is reduced and sometimes in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when the quality of the image continues is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the sound band is a matter of taste.
In order to please the majority of the youth group, the sound band belongs to the category "every one of his father and his mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game only for his music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confused.
If the game were to avoid completely stupid errors, we would have trouble saying that The Run is the best NFS game in recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not over.
Fun is assured, but you are prepared because mistakes will strike you in the eyes with the strength of some airport reflectors.

The Ambassador to the EU, Vice-President:
The Czechs have a reputation for negative and Eurosceptic.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war without a quarter."
"It will take five, six years before the situation gets a little stable, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles," said the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová, convincedly started his conference at the Faculty of Law.
How can you not take your "clearly and openly on Europe", which you said in the first part of your conference, when you managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such clarity and clarity, because it would be the envy of many of the Conferences of the Faculty of Law of the U. Carolina.
Vice-President Herman van Rompuy also took note of the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council:
"First comes criticism, that if it's insulting, a grey official, able to take on any role, but I have to say that he left all the confused, because he takes his roles to perfection."
"It is a man who can listen to members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and who has a clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new post of representative of the foreign and security policy is explained by the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" This is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of the political union towards States such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban Olomouc's cheese.
Vice-President has also taken care of the agenda to follow, follow and follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech Presidency was a success two years ago.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Association.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Chequia.
Czech representation in the EU currently has many commitments.
In the Ambassador's words: "a good aborote", not only the Presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being dealt with.
On the other hand, the EU budget for seven years, caused by the current economic situation, must be approved much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, what sectors will have priority, what countries will receive greater support and what less? That is something that will be present on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled his main slogans, with which he came to Europe: "About Europe with clarity."
"The truth is I don't like the ugly abbreviations, the foreigners or the savages that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels pepins are not really invented the curved or round pepins, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to forbid us the cheese of Olomouc?"
It also intends to benefit more from the EU's environment and to bring more Czech citizens closer to European institutions.
Europe is waiting for us at speeds
According to the ambassador, the Czechs are famous for Eurosceptics and people are better aware of the negative aspects than the positive ones.
He also regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
Guilty is a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivation messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, it highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"I believe that when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and comes to me a Slovak, a French beside me says to me, 'What, have you left, those of the Visegrad Group?', and it is seen that it does no good to him.'
In the future, the EU, according to Vizenová, is awaiting new long-term budgetary policy rules for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe than the new "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"For the first time it was said that only those countries that wanted and did not, that remained outside, cooperate."
"These procedures will be increasingly and will strengthen Europe at both speeds," Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, he also stressed the role of Chequia and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the EU as a whole should be debated among the Member States, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Burn story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If anyone were looking for a term that would define IBM's strategy very precisely, the closest one would be "long-term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived to be current and yet has been over a hundred years since its foundation.
The foundation of this long-lasting character laid the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He has already heard the slogan that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his seal, around which the life of the giant future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the foundation of a carefully raised business culture.
"For us, IBM involves a long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained faithful to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around it.
This has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper even further in our second century," said during his anniversary, the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees as Bâta's employer in Chequia (IM's employees were from the first U.S. workers who enjoyed paid vacations, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated pay system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication keeps IBM in relation to the client.
Since the beginning, the company has been able to discover talents (if it was one of the first world companies to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
On the line of the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, whereby Palmisano will replace it with the coming year of a woman: Virginia Rometti.
She has been working for 30 years in IBM, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
During recent years IBM has participated in so-called virtual meetings, a rain of online ideas, which emerges infinity of future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that there are ideas, since almost half a million people work in the company.
An institution with good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with an internal and external image.
"Since the beginning, IBM has maintained a concept of an institution more than a technological company," says Harvard Business School economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users," says George Colony of Forrester Research consultant.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or the "Grand Verde" - as is known in the USA familiarly because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world in the last 100 years.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (which develops both equipment and software, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It shows the largest number of patents of all American technology companies and five of their employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among its inventions are automatic cash registers, payment cards, financial swaps, bar codes and floppy disks.
IBM will bill this year $220 billion. This year has become the second technology firm for market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the Future
Not all products and innovations just satisfy the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not put up with its own operating system, OS/2, online services Prodigy or PCjr computers).
"If your business is based on progress, it cannot be emotionally anchored in the past," acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problems building its bases on other platforms (and also, if it does not work, abandon them).
And that's the difference in competition, Microsoft, which basically maintains and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In the case of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which approximately one fifth are programmed and another fifth are equipment.
However, in 1990, the teams represented more than half of the supplier's quota.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-performance assets for a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in future technology purchases.
Investments have followed since 2008, when the world's current financial crisis first emerged.
IBM acts according to the assumptions of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment during the great economic crisis of 29.
It seems that until now IBM has been able to understand the crisis.
The value of IBM's shares since the beginning of 2008 has increased strategically to 120%, and the net profit of the company has not been increased.
The IBM currency is to change everything, except for its value.
So you can expect that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
History of IBM: from cheese cutter to space flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tableling Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted already in 1924 - it was originally a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The foundation that led to the birth of IBM arises from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He had inventions such as the famous "reloj of fixtures", which enables him to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also presided over his supervisory board until 1930.
Flint joined the head of a competition firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM ( Watson's ideas remain the firm basis on which corporate culture and identity are maintained).
Watson directed the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business equipment, from meat cutters and cheese to register boxes.
During the first four years that Watson directed the company, the billing doubled by $9 million and began the company's great expansion by the continent.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost 40 years later, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA to guide flight to space (in Mercurio, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fish", which established the computer standard of that time, came to the market with the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering a full, high-value advice and services.
The strategy IBM has paid these last three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, that is, "a smarter planet".
Its aim is to make a more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned or circumstances have improved, for example with regard to the transport and administration of cities.
For the trade sector, IBM presented not long ago the Smart Trade platform that allows retailers to manage the full business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch in Czechoslovakia from then, the first country he had in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic centre of externalization in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague. There is also a world-famous research team working with voice recognition.
Rector about your unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richtářová (53) said acabó!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina was still hoping that Joseph would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and have set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but not like my partner anymore," explained Rjtářová.
When Darina Rhyttářová accepted Bartošov in her home during the summer, she could not imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Ríčany and Pepe did not leave the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship and even fired him forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who's listening to his wife.
If one day Rightář broke up with Bartošová, his wife would not expect him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him out."
"But here I would live, not as my dear old drunk who was wrong, but as a man who joins me in certain ties," Rychtārová said and added that he had already disengaged from his husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Joseph does not care so far that a woman has closed her back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
"My wife established this as a marriage on the role and I respect it."
"The company is still in force, I make house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I make purchases."
"Darina and I talked to each other normally, the only thing is that we don't share a bed," said Richtrář.
If Rychtārová found a new love, he would not resist.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't care where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I'm in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," Joseph concludes.
The worst vices of women: Do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to quote some typical vices of women, they will usually be named without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize them in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that can cause men to bleed blood?
Go shopping
Do you blame your average orange that depends on the purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one trap per week?
Do you like to buy often in the underpants?
Then in your case it can be said that going shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should calm their passion for purchases, at least a little.
But what woman could resist the temptation to walk without more by the clothes shops, look for well-adjusted clothes and then try them all on the testator ( ideally in all different colors)?
Although most women go shopping is a passion, for men they can practically become a hell.
Just remember how many times you've told your partner that you better wait in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"Would you need to weigh at least five pounds - should you start to exercise?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't those phrases sound like it?
What do you mean?
Then she is one of those women obsessed with her appearance.
It is not that you should stop caring, but many men are allergic to listening to your mate complain all the time of your physical aspect.
Strong sex also agrees that the more frequent complaints are made, the more upset women become.
Order and cleaning first
It's like an infinite typhoon.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, rub the floor, remove the dust, rub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Does he blame his partner for treading the clean ground with a dirty foot, his children who have sucked a newly cleaned sink and a stand with glass doors that cost him so much to clean?
In case you suffer from this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should certainly not deal with being primary in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten their relationships and family well-being.
Make distasteful comments
"The pants used are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to get those shoes used tomorrow too."
"The wet trap is not left on the ground!"
If you make those comets to your partner more often a day, you know that this will get you out of your boxes.
Of course, you don't mean anything wrong, you just want to make it all right.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Calamities and chismes
Some women are also exposed to slander, jesting, but also to insults and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk about things like who, where, who, how, and why.
At best, every one of us sometimes escapes a small and harmless chism.
With the hand in the heart, this is the self of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are chismous women of those who are not controlled, those who love and do it often despise everyone and are dangerous to those who surround them, especially in a female labor team.
Jagr and Voráček helped with their assistance to overcome Philadelphia
The hockey leader Jaromir Jagr participated in the NHL meeting on Monday with two assistances that brought the victory over Philadelphia 5:3 in the Carolina box and put the Czech players back in the vanguard of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star and took another step and was declared the best player of the game.
Two assistances were awarded in the party and Jagr's partner, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jagr said in front of the ultramarine journalists that Giroux had preached a great night.
"Before the party, I'd told you I'd have tripled."
"He was present."
"Sometimes they seem ambushed," explained Jagr, after his performance gave him a goal to Giroux, as a result of the Flyers' first stroke.
A while later, the team's second intervention also had a Czech trail.
Voráček was made with the disc behind the Hurricane Portery and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second part the Flyers had already dominated.
Especially by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jagr he scored the third goal, after his shot was shot down by Wayne Simmonds's doorway.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean that he's the best player in the game, but he's definitely among the three best," Jagr thought to his center.
"I would never have happened that at the end of my career I was going to play with a sportsman like him."
"I'm very happy about that."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in the NHL, my companions played for me, and that now produces results," Jagr added.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with Tuom Routu's goal and then again from Dwyer, from penalti, to a distant goal.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they ended up out of number two against one.
"Pringer had a good performance in our field."
"I cleared the record, I took the speed and read went to the farest part."
"I tried to touch the disc and I'm glad I got it," Voráček described the party's last goal as he lived.
With its victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Šparek, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired for an injury on the upper part of the body.
The Canadians not only lost a player with a lot of defensive experience, but also for a difference of two goals, 2:3.
I didn't know how to take one of the shots.
More than the lost points to the local trainer lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and played the game only with five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game only with a veteran player, the rest were novels."
"At last, but it is that nothing can be done against it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"So much to turn the players back on us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the record out of our field."
"And that's how we're making fun of it," one of the defenses explained, P. K. Subban.
Porter Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
The Jets goals were marked by five players who put an end to a series of victories that had already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in most cases travels only to the socialist block, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went from vacation to the beaches of the RDA (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, then the Yugoslav regime turned to the west and the travels of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) would not be allowed to travel freely and individually by socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, the individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West at that time, but one should put on the tail with a sleeping bag and spend the night like this, or have "known goods" in the agency.
Still not everything was earned.
The so-called "change promise" that was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically untrustworthy people", which could not travel at all.
The Czech currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of change, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cabins and summer houses that the Czechs would acquire.
The way of travelling from the Czechs has suffered a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 it was no longer the holiday in the RDA or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, from which we are no longer aware today, that Croatia could not travel freely until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia since then.
In the early 1990s, visa exemption was imposed to travel to the neighbouring Western European States, resulting in a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not see the maps of the trips to the West, everyone wanted to see it for at least one moment.
For example, in Paris the Czech groups slept in the parks in campaign shops, as our income from that time did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was taking food (conservations, embittered, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy freely Western currency.
Our standard of living increased and with him also the average wages, which around 1997 led to an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increased demand for travel, the agencies began, from 1997 onwards, to prepare travel using charter flights, which led to an incredibly low prices for travel compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for passenger volumes.
By the end of the 90th century, the Czechs had already traveled without a visa to almost all developed countries, except the United States, which further simplified our journeys.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism occurred in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Chequia to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists have been making distant and warm countries. This winter will already fly directly from Chequia to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, arrived in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States eliminated visas for Czech tourists, with what our country became among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent more than 15,000 Czech crowns per head in foreign travel, including spending on the site of stay.
Called the General Assembly to elect the President, who could end up dead again.
For almost five months, Czech football has been without president and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hasek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburg.
In fact, there has not yet been an agreement on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, no vote can be taken even to elect between the three candidates.
The stakeholders and chairman of the Czech football are Jindřich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paklík.
Haszek resigned in June not without first calling his colleagues with the intention of finding a strong person who would assume that he would take care of football in the future.
However, after the end of the Haszek era, there was a dispute between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on 16 September when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dům), located in the Prague neighborhood of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only in terms of the method of election.
No consensus was reached, and no one in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or delegates with full authority.
From that point on, and because of this only point, a partial agreement was reached, supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer be shed on the Executive Committee, which, at its regular or extraordinary meetings, basically had not resolved anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the neurologic point remains the same.
The question is: How to proceed in the third round to avoid the dead point?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of FAČR's three vice-presidents, who, since the direction of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round, the candidate who has a higher percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his application will win.
The Moravia Region is ready to reach a commitment so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
However, the Bohemian part imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have at least two thirds.
"This would, however, remove the meaning of the two previous rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, according to which it would be best not to play the order and vote in accordance with the applicable statutes.
Tomas Paclík is also in agreement with this, although it is assumed that the electoral regulation established by the statute of all candidates is more appropriate to Pelta.
"I would like you to vote as much as possible in accordance with the statutes."
"In order not to invent any nonsense about representatives as in the last General Assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who for the first time applied as a candidate and who directed his comments mainly against Pelta.
Pelta's still optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will calm down with today's party of our national team at the European Championship.
"The football will again become a protagonist, and thus cooperate more closely," says the representative of Jablonice, who among the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professional and regional.
Rijkl is the most reticent.
"I hope there is an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
"This is not the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"In any case, I hope that the common sense will be imposed," said Rijkl.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the game starts if the football team is complete?
The special aircraft, on which they had to travel to Podgorica, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Reichl, did not leave this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to seek an alternative to transport the executive committee to the place where the classification party will take place.
Perhaps the decision-making meeting could finally be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which they say will be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would like to incorporate the parties divided into the country's most powerful sports organization to reach an agreement.
There is much at stake: the state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Federation of Sport (CHSTV) that will try to provide a new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paklík will fight to reach the presidency, because he does not find a suitable candidate.
If the leader of Pilsen's footballers, Tomas Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly, knew the name of an appropriate candidate to satisfy all his ideas about the new President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not be presented as a candidate to such a relevant position.
"If there was a suitable person, I would be fighting for her and not present myself as a candidate for the elections."
"But to this day, such a person has not been found," said Paclik to the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclik to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rijkl is precisely the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged election winner, who opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paklík also points out that, if he wins, he would remain in the office of president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that position, he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too involved with football events.
"I've already spoken to some people I might consider."
"For me it was crazy to hear some say that at this moment they don't even want to be identified with the Czech football."
"I'd like to change that vision," he adds.
What seems to be most disturbing to Paclik right now is Pelta's relationship with the president of Pilsen Roman Berbr's Regional Football Association, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"In case he wins, the current status would be maintained and nothing in football will change."
"With Berbra's support, a man of ambitious business, football will take even less advantage," Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a phone call during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta came out.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us," said Paclík, who also takes some caution in his earlier statement that "the Pilsen Club would sell if Pelta became president."
In case of winning the elections on Thursday, Paklík could focus on cooperation with Pelta in the future.
In the same opinion, the other candidate, Rijkl, has been supported by Paklík before the General Assembly in September, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine it, for example, as head of representation."
"but not as manager of an association."
"I also don't put the noses where I don't feel able," said Paclík, who in September raised a lot of attention to support the suspension of the Committee of Arbitrators chaired by Ludek Macel, then replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paklík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
It uses its management capabilities for private companies, as since last summer it is also the Director of Pilsen, who with his support celebrated the first division triumph in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and to contribute to their safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathies to the president of Sparta Daniel Kretínský.
One of the priorities would also be to strengthen the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it was exerting pressure on political leaders to make more money for the sport of lottery taxes.
"It's one of the key problems the new president should be devoted to."
"If they increase the gambling taxes, as the political parties announce, they would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where this money is going to stop," he says.
In addition, Paclík is not even aware of his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR should be "no party".
Pelta is also associated with Jablonec and Rijkl with Dukla de Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see the sense of giving my actions of Pilsen Club hypocritically to another person to come back there after a year and a half," said Paclik.
Pelta promised FAČR new statutes that would end the dead point of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that FAČR had a new statute that would definitely serve to resolve the disputes regarding the electoral rule in the future.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about this Thursday's meeting in Nymburg, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, in case it was elected, precisely on representation and on raising funds.
He decided to take part in the last minute at the last general assembly, so this two-month delay could be good for him to defend and present his ideas on football management in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been dealing with football for a long time and are looking forward to meeting the new President this Thursday."
"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association," thinks the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked on the Sparta and the executive committee of the Association.
For this reason, you think you have enough experience to manage Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Haszek.
"Unfortunately, in the General Assembly of June the statutes were adopted which were not as perfect as they all thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the re-adjustment of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a sign for the benefit of delegates.
"If they choose me as president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am willing to answer in case this fails."
"It's a matter of principles, without which we can't exist," says Pelta.
Moreover, in theory, try not to interfere with your opponents.
Already in the past I had warned that he was working with Henry Reichl, whom he respected for his training in Law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It's been a long time without attacking Thomas Paklík who, unlike Pelta, didn't give up titering with his head.
"It's been over a year in the football world, and it's already made some success."
"His attacks but they were embarrassing and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt his true character," said his opponent Pelta, who remained faithful to the statements announced already in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the top.
The latter should be free of the promotion of football.
"I would also try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal of last year."
"I would then be involved in the negotiations with the public and the private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He also promised that his appointment as president of football would not entail any personal modification of the template.
"It would have to know the duties of each employee first," he said, referring to Straovov where, after a long period of anarchy, an understanding nervousism would prevail.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are being Vaticand before the next general assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain to Nymburg this Thursday.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"The football needs credibility, which will only recover if you finally have a leader," two more days before the most decisive day in your career as a representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rachel promises, that under her leadership, FAČR would begin to work willingly.
If the current Vice-President Jindrich Reichl was elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association in the Fourth General Assembly, many people would surely be reluctant.
Rachel promises that, if she was elected, she would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and ensure that members of the executive committee are responsible for each football area individually.
It is also committed to resolving the case of the Bohemians, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, making more money for football and continuing the work initiated by former President Ivan Haszek.
"As president, I'd like to devote myself completely to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, passing through professional football or training of young high-performance footballers."
"With this I don't mean that I would do it all alone," said Rijkl in an interview for the ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee so that each member can be dedicated to a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with much impulse."
"Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not presenting itself again as a candidate.
"Everyone knows that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will prevent me and hinder me from every step," he explained the reasons for their indecision.
"Many people have told me that I should not give up on winning, because then the others would also win."
"It's about having faith not to give up like that, no more," he said.
It is said that it also motivates him to continue the work he has already begun with Haszek.
"For those two years, a large part of the work that I don't want to lose has ended."
"There are processes that have begun and that will have its effect within a couple of years and I would not like to have some parents," he announced concerned that, if they elected the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association might be as it was before the time of Haszek.
"I believe in the order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is unable to maintain.
"After him is above all those people who would take care of football so that it would be only a privilege for a few elected."
"I can blame a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in favour of someone."
"I'm trying to be a target."
"I want to make a football for everyone, because only that's how everyone will feel and not just the elected," said Rijkl.
It also rejects the idea that only the president would be Bohemian.
"Although some people are trying to say otherwise, I have in mind to do as much for Moravia as possible."
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech part and another dwelling, whose winners would go to the first division."
"There would not be the current situation in which we have only three Moravia teams, which represents a problem for young Moravia players," Rijkl said.
Although in the fight for presidential elections, Tomas Paclík, President of the Pilsner Club, did not stop believing in his chances of being elected.
"I still feel a strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice-president and who knows that behind me there are clear successes," said Rijkl, whose successes include saving tens of millions of corrupt contracts crowns, negotiations on television contracts and negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, he recognizes his share of guilt that the federation is not united.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is "degraded to regain confidence in Czech football", he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year."
"In case it is elected, it will probably follow what Ivan Haszek has already started and would not significantly change the staffing pattern in the committees."
"I don't want to use that in my favor," he evaluates his rivals Rachel.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Blue Jump
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible sightseeing, beautiful bathrooms in Budapest: Who to visit Europe can live its wonderful blue, and, after a visit to the city or walk, rest your tired feet in bubbling baths.
A book shows where you find the best well-being in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip during the past year and a half, there was something that could not be missed in his luggage, a bathrobe.
Backdrop on the water, he looked at the dome art on the top, swam to the marble angels, who were waiting for him on the edge of the pool and were amazed at the modernist covered pool, which was completely restored.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his book at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectonic historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools this way and presents them in his recent book "Badefreuden": the pools covered in Munich, the historic bathrooms in the Black Forest, the "hormigon constructions" in Taunus.
He accomplished his "travel through the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe" by 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places from Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
This 46-year-old German is a real enthusiast of the bathroom culture.
She doesn't want anything to do with sports, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers you that the lovers of the bathroom have to conform with blue blue and chlorine yeast, while the lovers of running can breathe the fascinating smell of bees forests or listen to the joyful trains of the birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why the pools must always be so ugly," says this resident of Vienna.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The capoteo in the pool and the ethereal oil of the sauna. The factor of well-being in the pools is so great because all the senses are taken care of, according to Meder.
And if the builder tries, the covered pools can be a real gift for the view: "In the bathrooms there is a water surface."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
It all doubles optically: high bends, color blues, trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides 190 pages of very interesting data on the architecture and history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but, above all, it makes a wish to jump to blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the outstanding copies of his research in Hungary.
Along with the magnificent medical baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, the water with nitrates is found in a unique karst cavities (baths in caves in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some spas, whose pools are of alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városios Termáfürdö in Jászberény).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city places eyes on the Zurich-dwelling swimming pool, you can look at Arlberb, snow-covered, from the outdoor swimming pool in St. Antón, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
The design, perhaps more extraordinary, is waiting for customers in Langenfeld: Ötztal Water Cathedral looks like an oven that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open sources rise steam in winter, while the Ötztal mountains rise deep in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell in sulphur, in the baths of Arpád in Békessaba, Hungary, the gasulose plague is so strong that people think they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and whose legume is glued to the skin when entering the pool, a pleasure of the well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in his search for nice places for the bathroom, when he wanted to visit discovered swimming pools and sun baths in the Czech bathroom of Luhatschowitz, he found himself with a blocked land.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the demolished windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the curse grow among the blues.
The decadence was counter-resisting in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three stages of construction behind them; not only neo-romantic elements of the times of their construction can be discovered in 1844, if not also an Arabic Alhambra-style hall, added in 1900.
Since its so-called modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural of the Black Forest.
"It's very good to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," says Meder.
In a palace like this, immersion in the thermal pool appears to be of little importance.
Agricultural speculative
Deutsche Bank analyzes the business of raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, it is clear, according to one study, that 84 percent of Germans do not seem acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifys the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a survey by the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity bags raises prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The consumer's campaign is directed specifically to Josef Ackermann, director of the Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, bets on raw materials were thought to protect traders from price oscillations.
The main experts agree that players have disconnected from offers and demands, and profit from the cost of the poorest.
Ackermann responded to criticisms differently from US competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business "should compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed at the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank directive, together with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the management of the bank will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment.
Ackermann is trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, the founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The betting on growing food prices shows particularly drastic how waste banks currently harm public welfare."
Ackermann is the largest bank chaplain, especially in obligations.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all of its portfolio investments in which the money is put at stake for food price bets," Bode said.
"Alright if Ackermann is dealing with people who go hungry or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors would change something different from what was not planned in the board of directors.
With the abandonment of the controversial agricultural speculation, you can perfect your image.
And he only needs to care for possible losses, so he will take care of his successor.
Two thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Force Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 per cent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were set.
Many bank customers have shown personal consequences by discovering that their bank was involved in such business: according to the survey, two thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes from agricultural speculation.
43 per cent would disincentive a bank so to their acquaintances, 49 per cent would, after reflecting, cancel their account and change to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The retraced flag
Por Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with high buildings and a happy ending, the pavilion of the Austrian universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 received awards, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and rested.
Now it's reopening as a exhibition house.
The architecture of modern postgerra passionatea, the clear forms, the crystal halls, the brave curves and the new construction materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, so that the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 is an appropriate and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then obtained the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating construction of steel and glass.
Construction is now considered a contemporary milestone in architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built Austria's pavilion at the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW, the adjacent building in Munich became internationally known.
His pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, arose after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to the southern Vienna station, was reformed in 1962 and a museum of the 20th century was opened inside, the "House 20" was called.
The building was suitable but lacked adequate space and technology for a museum; without any wall to hang art, no good environment.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and disappears more and more.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now called it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a contemporary art museum.
On Tuesday afternoon, the Belvedere museum was inaugurated, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, a blow of luck in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Belvedere gallery since 2007, achieved a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, artistic skater on ice in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and founder of the modern art museum in Salzburg, implemented reforms with the insistence of politicians and patrons of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are exposed, there should be a cafeteria and a library and also a office building.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to make.
Not only because he had significantly reformed Joseph Olbrichs' secession in Vienna, he was enlarged and awarded the contest, if not because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Vienna Technical University and the pavilion was for him an "important and huge place", in which he considered the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in exchange for use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are major problems, the building was "an energy eater," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the windows of the crystal facade was changed, an insulating crystal was installed reinforced with glass fibre and the crystal roof was replaced by a special safety crystal.
The thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and the asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel down between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still Schwanzer pavilion.
The original outer doors remain, the house is painted in old caoba shades and protected against oxidation.
And the movie room is exactly as it used to be.
And all of this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked the monumental protection office," Krischanitz says and warns of an aperture floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
That of the pavilion "that came from Brussels" has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that is why he wanted "to wake up the right consciousness".
In this case, house 21 is not in the wrong place, has been hit by urban fate. The completely new and planned "central station barrier", with homes and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And it may happen another blow of luck: House 21 could receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, since the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as you can hear, negotiate with the city about a nearby place in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a package of winter crisis that amounts to millions
The company has come up with a crisis plan, which would avoid the lack of trains in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
What costs millions.
In the fight against snowflakes and delays in trains caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The Bild newspaper, calling for an internal crisis plan for the group, reported on the investments planned until 2005 of a total of about EUR 300 million.
To achieve better availability of vehicles and even the rail network with extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from the roads and from the others.
The aim is to clean snow and ice fans for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train delays and delays during this winter also after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable difficulties in the transport of passengers, as, among other things, he lacked reservations against adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for an authorization from the Federal Railway Office for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently at the workshop, after a high-speed train would suffer the break of an axle at the central station of Cologne.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines in the US.
After the riot on President Josef Ackerman, a new US problem appears, Deutsche Bank has to pay a millionaire fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the US acquires the giant in the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million) in an agreement, to put an end to the contents due to the failure of five major credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage securities.
The NCUA financial market regulator advocates many large banks to induce credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized risks.
Such titles lost their value during the financial crisis and dragged banks to the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the subject without the parties having to approach the courts," said a spokesman for the Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not accept any fault with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which made a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of NCUA, celebrated the distinction between the two financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit cooperatives and provides support in case of failure to protect customer investments.
NCUA seeks to reintegrate the losses of millions of origin.
The agreements currently concluded are their first type.
The regulator had also asked for accounts from other large banks and in summer disputes against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of dubious mortgages, these are the so-called mortgage-backed values.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble erupted in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial entities.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results have taken place a few years ago, it is currently blowing up a complicated wind for US banks.
Investors and inspection have set up countless processes to receive compensation or punish defects.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of demands.
He blames the 18 major international banks that the two US mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has an FHFA claim, which is worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without naming an exact number.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that he wanted to defend himself.
Warren Buffet contributes 10 billion to IBM
The financial guru, Buffet, invests heavily in the IBM Information Technology Company.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or information technologies as long-term development forecasts of companies are negative.
But he has read the commercial report of IBM and changed his opinion on investing in the sector.
He had to understand much before IBM offered services and sought computer systems for the Information Technology Departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive information technology must be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now discovered in the CNBC economy issuer that has acquired IBM shares for a value of $10.7 billion since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investment has gone up to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about the commitment until now.
He commended the management of the regular benefits in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has for some time established profit information technology services such as the operation of computing centres.
The old computer pioneer of over 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for companies.
Buffet has avoided technology companies so far.
He said he was only investing in companies whose business he would understand.
On the contrary, Buffet took advantage of the occasion in a freight train, in a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway has approximately 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Municher Reb.
Buffet, 81 years old, was commissioned by the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 60s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his life - style is humble.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense of winning money has given him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM's stock in stock went up one percent.
"The Blue Giant", as IBM is known, has a stock exchange value of over $220 billion and is a figure, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, he said Buffet, he doesn't want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is a close friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of "the Zwickau cell", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "blood ideology" that is coming back to life.
The murders of eight small, tricky and Greek entrepreneurs between 2001 and 2006 have a cross-section of the extreme right.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin, there has been a fear and concern about this news.
For many Turkish-born Germans, a ghost believed to be dead a long time ago, since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there had been no more episodes of violence with extreme right against Turks.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The ultra-rightist network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, nor much less, predictable.
"Does blood ideology come back to life?", titled the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" points out the contrary that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informer of the Federal Office of Defence of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-drequisite.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a guard at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with the German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn act of the 50th anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with happy colors, such as a happy ending story.
The information came to some Turkish media as a buffoon: "The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German issue "Hürriyet" also does not insist on tracking this mental connection.
"Starts to smell bad," says Ahmet Külahci's column title.
He pointed out that the assassins were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In the online forums of Turkish-born Germans, the behaviour of the police and their subsequent success in the search are highly critical.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not sought out suspects before in the ultra-right circle.
Some appear to be less rhetorical about the drastic media: "From now on, immigrants are lost, only self-defence and arms are left."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The internal peace of Germany is strongly dependent on the quality of clarification and the adaptation of the sanctions to the entire network," writes "Selen."
This means that, if the domestic peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen will be clarified in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of Solingen fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memories.
No other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that distrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks exacerbate the Turkish side's group feeling.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish press, then, mainly the lack of German policy after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln's survivors.
After Solingen's firefighting, he sent a telegram of pity to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his Foreign Minister, replaced him at the Cologne funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Germans contribute to the taxes.
It is clear how the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media again shows how deep it is, since then, the disbelief of many Turkish-born Germans in the legality of this country.
In addition to the efforts of a broad explanation and a re-evaluation of extreme-right terrorism in Germany, this time there is a need for frank words.
The bank of the scandal of Lake Zurich
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
The UBS almost broke into bankruptcy in the financial crisis and since then it has been shifted from a crisis to the following.
Now I'm running a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit in July, it was known that in 2013 he would begin a new and almost equally spectacular work: President of the board of directors of the great Swiss UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoices, praises Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired solidity and lets us comment kindly on his future companions.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I am happy to work with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all bank security systems and betrayed EUR 1.7 billion.
Oswald Grübel, director general of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to go.
The president of the administrative board of the USB was considered equally touched since then, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber should advise the bank since February 2012.
And the Presidency of the administrative council will be chaired in May, not in early 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and counsellor and has had a period of certainly necessary adaptation.
The strike is responsible for a bank's strategy, which has just proven that it deserves the title "the largest bank of the scandal in Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years it has been a scandal for the next.
Nothing, it seems, saves the former such proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss property manager discreetly and solidly, but also faintly, was combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 billion, the USB manages more money than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That's impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and subsequent bank professor in Zurich for many years explains: "Before my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one is asked: How could I be mistaken?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it went out in the light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, Director General, who until then was considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund was in loss with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions of dollars.
To load with this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
To this he found inversors, of course, that some looked with contempt until recently: an Asian and opaque state fund of Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative council, in 2006 in Switzerland's second best paid administrative council, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its wrong investments, the UBS was in the financial crisis before the crash and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank purchased troublesome values for UBS for many billion, the Helvetica Confederation gave six billion francs for a compulsory convertible bond, which became the bank's co-ownership.
All Switzerland was affected, the dramatic claim was made that this was for a small country, if it accommodates such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times higher than the economic results of Switzerland (see chart).
"We can't rescue the UBS again," said Geiger, a bank expert.
At the first disaster, the second one was joined.
A few months later, UBS capitulated a fiscal conflict with America and was willing to deliver the data of the inundated customers, which they had possibly fraudulently taxed with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approved a figure of $780 billion, reimbursement of unjustifiable benefits from these transactions with a pay compensation.
As a result, UBS confessed more or less to having helped in fiscal fraud.
Simultaneously he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for rich customers: the aureola of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This followed the resignation of the President of the Board of Directors and of the President of the Administrative Council.
And the exodus of the customer's funds.
In this way, in a few months, the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment bank through false speculation and in the administration of property by aiding tax fraud.
And just when it was a little quieter again, just when it was thought that the UBS was getting it back, this unresolved operator's story happened, an individual operator robbed EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank realized that something was going wrong.
And, of course, this still does not work well with risk management in the investment bank.
"With the case of Adobe it is shown that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the University of Zurich's Banking Institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of UBS is that it does not control risk controls".
The idea of caution arose, with which the Swiss bankers had long been present, to be the guardians of the world's greatest goods: no too great risk, on the other hand, the security of the money wants to break down on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of the Swiss banks were the symbol of unbreakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of the authentic chocolate.
The central UBS in Zurich does not match the cliché of the Swiss private bank, it is only a little larger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on the Bahnhofstraße street of Zurich, which goes from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, marked by the snowcapped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are bright, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here are jewelry such as Tiffany`s among traditional Swiss business such as the Sprüngli depot.
The Swiss banks have been living here for years: from the national bank, passing through the palace of Credit Suisse, to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
It enters the reception room of the UBS through a heavy turning door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, front there are large leather chairs, next to the bank logo there is a large letter to indicate "security".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point have shifted the idea of the great Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank believes.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, at the end and in the end, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both large banks.
The UBS has become too large, it believes, mainly in the investment bank, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained land.
There the Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they've been used for a long time to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon Investment Bank, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"This Wednesday the small government coalition of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The UBS crash" in Spanish).
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the large bank of the bank.
How are they doing?
They talk to the Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
There is a bank that, due to the merger, was too big for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
It therefore served to complement the two different precursor banks of the UBS: a rich but sleepy bank with the centre of property administration in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, internationalised investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could round a large financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative board.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Opel were a perfect team," says the bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Opel, the intuition that has been able to open up from learning in the bank to the summit."
Finally, Opel became Wuffli.
And at the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: Destiny arrived before the case.
UBS employees clearly agree with the leadership meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Lower the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
The "League Tables" were headed by the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
A few steps went well for him.
In foreign exchange operations and in the negotiation of shares, it was the highest.
However, the advisors of companies in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the "fixed income" bank language, there is a huge compensation for the large banks.
UBS is empty in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Assuming growth, they invested the same bank as one of their high-risk funds created in American high-risk investments.
It was transformed into a powerful machine to hold American mortgages and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, as other banks have been looking down for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there," Geiger, a bank expert said.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order proved more complicated than they expected.
The posts in the UBS have become projectable seats and are uncertain to date.
Today, the one who runs a large bank has a job that is almost impossible.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, put an end to the investment bank, concentrate on the administration of goods, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to get that far (although).
But the investment bank must decrease a lot, it's clear at present.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, it was only thought of the 51-year-old Italian-Suizo as a transitional solution, since the bank was surprisingly separated from its Gribel predecessor.
However, he was charged: He must lead the UBS's business on a permanent basis, the Zurich bank reported on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the middle of the 1990s.
Removes 3,500 posts.
But that's not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money for?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask right now.
Until now he's just saying he's going to look for a home with his wife in Zurich first.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US bag
The imminent recession in Europe has frightened US investors in the beginning of the week.
The changes in government in Athens and Rome are still in force.
The slowed industrial production in the continent undermines the hope of stabilizing in its origin a debt-induced crisis.
General relief on government changes in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro fell in front of the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek vase has been seen half full, not half empty, but now the problems go back to a first plan, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, the financial assets are listed in the sales list.
The Dow Jones standard values index closed with a low of 0.6 percent to 12,078 points.
At the meeting, the market barometer ranges from 12.027 to 12.170 points.
The S&P 500 index closed with 1.251 points, one down per cent.
The Nasdaq index of the technology bag lost 0.8 percent and left the market with 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax index is fired with a decrease of 1.2 per cent to 5,985 points.
The industry of the 17 euro countries has clearly reduced its production and is at the end of its growth.
The companies produced two percent less than the previous month in September, as reported by Eurostat's statistical office.
What created skepticism among US investors: "We are not an island, if not dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be released so quickly from a recession, and there are also more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the legend of investments, just confirmed this caution, is not yet clear if Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview for the CNBC.
That is why it is too soon to invest in state loans or European banks from its point of view.
Instead, he throws around a decade of old principles and enters the US technology sector.
Its investment of more than $10 billion in IBM supports the assessment of the shares of the traditional consortium and makes it against the trend in the market in principle only a higher percentage.
The value closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
After some indications, Buffet paid $170 on average for each unit and maintained 5.5 per cent.
The rating of your investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 per cent.
The Bank of American participating titles were clearly strengthened by 2.6 percent rather than by the market.
The house sells almost all the rest of its shares to China Construction Bank and is therefore repaid $6.6 billion.
The Institute wants to strengthen its capital share primarily with the net profit of the business and thereby meet the regulatory requirements.
The Boeing aircraft builder increased its profits and thereby reduced the losses in Dow.
The action amounted to 1.5 per cent, after the consortium charged the largest charge of its history.
Airline Emirates commissioned 50 long-range aircraft of type 777 on Friday and the value of the request was estimated at $18 billion.
Including the options of 20 more machines, the volume amounts to $26 billion.
In the New York Stock Exchange, approximately 710 billion shares changed ownership.
719 values increased, 2281 decreased and 79 remained unchanged.
The Nasdaq is closed with sales volumes of 1.38 billion, 630 shares at the height, 1.913 at the bottom and 82 without changes.
Smart grasses extend in cities
In many places the grasses are considered "problem payers": they do not expel these intelligent animals from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like it, others want to get rid of it very quickly, the grasses have been a part of the city's image for years, but in many municipalities the neighbors' complaints for the profanity and noise of the animals are accumulated.
Although no means has appeared against the "problem payers" so far.
The grasses no longer leave the cities, the experts say in the first symposium on grasses in Leer, East Frisia.
There experts from all over the national territory discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to migration of certain protected grasses; chemical applications in agriculture clearly end up with traditional vital spaces.
The hunting, the growing building and the fall of trees that host them make the life of birds difficult.
Grains are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding couples in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, negative media owners skipped a controversial project to kill the district grass in mass.
Critics have qualified the hunting of animals by traps for birds and the murder of bats as particularly brutal.
"Explosing them and catching them in a normal way is not achieved," said Werner Klöver, urbanist and landscaper of Leer.
Shooting with water on the nests or dropping the trees is usually unwanted consequences, says also Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert Lahr, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals are separated, the large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
To catch them is imaginable as an exception in hospitals, old-age residences or colleges.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of Leer.
It is possible to combine the animals of sensitive residential areas and areas to re-occur in other places.
"Intellective panels instead of chain wires" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist makes advertising against the aim of dealing with animals in a completely different way: "The best thing is that we can stand a peak on the face with a bulb."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on Ascheberger’s grasses, where letters inform about the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticisms of bird noise: "All are forms of communication, they have much to say."
The intelligence and ability of these animals are legendary, the grasses not only take advantage of the resources to access skewed mouth, unless they make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at Cambridge University tested in four degrees until the intelligence of birds reached.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they should let a stone fall on a platform so as to reach a pollen larva.
Without much training, they firmly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the clever grasses had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers put a small cube with a pollen larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't reach their prey with the peak.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the tube puller.
Three of the four degrees got it in the first attempt.
Portugal in the Eurocopa 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and the Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favorites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in the Eurocopa 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed the latest Eurocopa 2012 tickets in Poland and Ukraine in the playoffs.
Guided by the triumphal hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8, 53.), Portugal swallowed Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after the 0-0 of the party, made the following five Eurocopa participations.
The Czechs got 1-0 (0-0) in the back of the play-offs game with the Montenegro outside, after they left things clear on the go (2-0).
Croatia did not allow it to be marked in 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland obtained a 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) marked the other goals of Portugal.
The former Bundesliga professional, Zvězdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) shorted distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic obtained a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 South Africa World Playoffs.
At the da Luz Stadium in Lisbon, Portugal began perfectly.
Ronaldo ran a direct book from more than 30 meters to head on the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his gifts to mark from a distance and got the 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not shine in the first half hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to the rider Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg team player, the English leader of Manchester City, sent a head to the ball, but the balloon did not cross the port line (33.).
Jiracek agreed for the Czech Republic
Next, collegiate Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was in the eyes of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the area of the Bosnian penti, he decided to show the Portuguese yellow card for being thrown to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark asked for a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the European Vice-Campion of 2004 clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended with the last doubt in the 81. minute with Petr Jiracek goal.
The 1976 European champion is ranked for the fifth consecutive time for the Eurocopa.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with the legionnaire of the Bundesliga Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) also had luck and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, the Petr Chech porter avoided with a reflection a possible goal at the door of Tomas Sivok (9).
Montenegro had more possibilities with both Steven Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic marked in the 40th minute of the frontal round, very just in the Chech gate.
After the break, the Czechs had to protect the spreader from the world famous porter, FC Seoul's front came back to escape (50.).
Finally, the goal before the final sentence was passed by the party.
Meanwhile, Turkey took advantage of Zagreb's wonderful football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink should leave his seat at the World Bank of 2002, the Croatians celebrated their fourth participation at the end of the Eurocopa.
Before 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost achieved a dream principle.
In the minute seven and with a long drop away, Selcuk Inan just got to play the post. Attacking Kazim Kazim also couldn't send the balloon inside the door.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly took control.
After the break, Croatia did not allow any goal to be scored.
Along with Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute took place in Ivan Perisic, Dortmund, Daniel Pranjic (Bayern de Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Entrracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundeslig in practice.
Trapattoni goes to Eurocopa
In Dublin, the Irish held the first Eurocopa participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who won with the 4-0 in the game ready for a preliminary decision, was put to the head in minutes 32.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) was involved with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the beginning, but it had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had his first great opportunity.
Since the first moment, the long defense has avoided possible goals of advantage.
But in the 32nd minute, he made it forward.
After a defense of the Porter Pavel London, Ward appeared and shot the balloon across the line, achieving 1-0.

"We'll get more research and development facilities and hire workers," said Bill McDermott, co-president, at a conference in Beijing.
Staff should grow from 2,500 workers currently to 4,500.

Massacre at personal level
The intense and generous new book of Peter Englund, The Beauty and the Pain of the Battle: An intimate story about the First World War, "begins with a long drama of the kind that can cause one to fall his soul to his feet.
Here are some action tips: Gently start this page and convert it to your brand pages.
It will come to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's news story, and this dramatic personate will work as his GPS, a light during those few moments in which, as one of his men and women, he is confused and desolate in the cloud of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which grants the Nobel Literacy Prize.
What you have written here is a little current book, which correctly describes as "an anti-history work."
It contains some notable names, important treaties or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, it explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about " feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"The beauty and the pain of the battle "combines the experiences in times of war of more than 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from colleges and botanicals to climbers, doctors, ambulance and administrative drivers.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, become mad, or die.
Their lives were here like vocal candles lit in a church; some new ones are added to the mixture while others are gone.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from the standard history books.
It is also correcting the notion that World War I was only the funty war of trenches in the western front.
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" is moving expertly through other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the east front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on the hills; one passes the Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intrusible problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a Hurricane Katrina that clings to cordita.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman who's at home with your children, are you staying or running?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
"Farence of facts," observed Mr. Englund, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmrough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high sea fleet.
His stories have been obtained in most of his memories, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about privacy and to fix it with what's in it.
About telling the story of a German college says, "Sustainees, everywhere we succeed."
"A coffee substitute, false aluminum, imitation rubber, paper sales, wooden buttons."
Keep talking about the next meal in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed in meat fat (and finished with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soils".
There, he notes, "837 meat substitutes allowed for the production of sausages, 511 coffee substitutes registered".
Some stories are about honor and value.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards the wild and demonstrates about war: "You feel that, after all, this is for what men are conceived and not for sitting in chairs with a cigarette and a whiskey, the newspaper of the afternoon or a best seller, and pretends that that this barbarism means civilization and that there is no bar behind that alimony and tachoonate lock."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die, and that no one will care or care about him.
"Once one gives up the thought of sacrificing, one would like to think that it might happen in front of the public," he writes.
On the other hand, it is horribly similar to "a convicted person being held in secret."
Other comments are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the livestock of the young century: The eloquent mass murderer and ideologically convinced with good packaging clothes that runs his carnage while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unpredictable ways; there is both innocuous and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund spoke of soldiers who actively tried to take a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to escape the service in front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the trade of gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and embalming their genitals with the hope of ending in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate are rubbing it over their eyes, which often leads to a blindness of life."
In this translation of the Swedish made by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war "dessert forces exceptionally uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as the Great War and Paul Fussell's modern memory, or novels like No novelty in front of Erich María Remarke, instead of integral stories.
Mr. Englund's volume joins a non-conventional pantheon.
Your book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a work of no fiction.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he had come from his book, pulled from between your fingers that page of drama characters, and burned it with a cerilla.
After a false step, a planned assault per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing anti-disruption helmets.
The night of Monday was chosen on Tuesday because Zucotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept in secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others who were joining an exercise.
The police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, and his presence emphasized how the operation was facing challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as the pimina spraying of spray on the demonstrators, breaking the department's rules and creating a public sympathy storm towards the "occupations".
And that's why the police operation to clear the Zuccotti Park of demonstrators was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The officers had been prepared to see how the occupations in other cities had been developed.
A major catastrophe simulation was taking place in Randalls Island, with an eye looking towards Zucotti.
The agents increased the so-called training of riots - counter-terrorism measures that involved quickly mobilizing a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on the night of Monday, on the east bank of Manhattan.
The orders to enter the park came in the "last minute", said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "a exercise".
"To the few policemen I know who were called for this, they didn't tell them that it was to enter Zucotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zucotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, some agents wanted to clear the park, but they quit when hundreds of demonstrators emerged early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved agents from various police units, including special forces from the entire municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who used to flood neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming from the park during the day, doing from 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do so when I was the least number of people in the park," he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with focussed voices gathered on the Pike Slip cross with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The light and pre-grabbed messages from the loudspeakers seemed to frighten many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their clear blue shorts, many demonstrators simply picked up their things and left.
No shop was touched until 1:45 a.m., the police said, giving the demonstrators time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen meeting in the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave it.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said that they were trying to prevent the police from taking action in the park, and that they had been treated abruptly by the agents.
Mr. Browne said that mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, could capture images.
As the police moved west through the dense maraine of the demonstrators' personal effects, including paper and plastic bags wrapped in clothes, cleaning department equipment followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly after.
A central group of demonstrators took positions near the kitchen area of the camp, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the camp's epicenter were moved by their arms.
And two people chained to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency service officers were called to cut the candads.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The discharge operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said that about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were due to "adjustment of public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The top-ranking officer in the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the senior uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department chief of detectives, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while he was present, "he wasn't leading the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, if they had to go in.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From these positions, he saw the police expanding the perimeter even beyond the Zucotti Park.
At a given time, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most noisy action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protestor jumped over the roof of a police car, and others were seen taking off the wheels of a police van.
At a given time, a piece of blanket flew out of the crowd.
Finally, an agent and a manifestor were hospitalized.
The support workers' union will demand the city for the discounts
The union that represents hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to demand the city on Wednesday, claiming that the dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that care for poor students.
The demand is possibly the last weapon at the disposal of the union, of the district 37, in its effort to withdraw the resignations.
Sixty-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost their jobs on 7 October, in a movement that trade union leaders have described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, the city's access to a health care fund for working groups to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied that charge.
In a hearing in the Town Hall last month, the Education Councillor, Dennis M. Walcott, said that the discharges were part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council hired him to say that nothing in the budget specified that the school support staff would be fired.
Officials of the municipal district 37 said they had filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be requested, and a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce the official submission of the request, at the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The claim will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the city as accused, and there are eight dismissed workers as claimants, all black or Latin women, as well as the majority of those who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the Legal Department of the city, said that the city had not seen the demand and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a questionnaire from The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of dismissals in poor schools in the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools have lost more assistants, as they have been chronically subsidized.
It is noted that although there were no fires in Staten Island and a few fires in schools in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in the 23th District in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired in the 8th and 9th Districts in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the 36th Public School in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of fostered parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit".
P.D. The 36th district budget was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way in which additional funding is calculated for each poor student registration in schools.
The trade union also states that senior school directors may have been deceived by language in a memorandum allowing parent coordinators to be fired.
The memorandum used the word "exceeding" to describe the action, although "exceeding" more often describes the act of transferring a teacher from a school to a work bag, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Six hundred and six parents' coordinators were dismissed," says the complainant, "and not only in excess."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are finally willing to agree on something related to the rise in Libya.
All that was needed was that the rebellion was successful, that the veteran dictator Muamar Gaddafi was captured and murdered, and that the United States' participation had come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution sponsored by President John Kerry (democratic by Massachusetts), together with Senators John McCain (republican by Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent by Connecticut), praising the Libyans for their successful rebellion and the US troops for their "valence".
"This resolution is to honor the braves of Libya, starting to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is a bipartisan statement of support for its democratic aspirations."
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, the legislators of both parties fought with each other and with the White House on the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of US military in NATO's mission to Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the Chamber by a wide bilateral margin, and it never came to vote in the Senate.
But the same day that the bill was rejected in the Chamber, the camera also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for US operations in Libya.
That left the US mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress as upset enough as to criticise Obama's management of the mission, but not as angry as to actually swallow the grass under his feet.
The indecision of the Congress was then overcome by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was murdered on 20 October.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs " congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and "glorify the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism".
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or will it divide the legislators as the June bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (India), the committee's chief Republican.
Lugar spokesperson said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other hand, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlate (Republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other subject that actually achieves a vote of the entire assembly in the House or Senate at this Congress.
Other legislators have so far failed to make their amendments to the assembly, but not because of lack of attempts.
Goodlate is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced at this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment only in the House, and another fist that "will control federal expenditure."
Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors - especially new Republicans who seek to refine their curriculums - the opportunity to juggle that they were the "authors" of this measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that Congress members can perform, while representatives of José E. Serrano (Democrat for New York), want to remove the two mandates limit for the presidents.
The representative of Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat by Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment prohibiting homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as a ban on the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that members have been in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 at 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn't have much more success then than they have now.
The last amendment added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by the Congress in 1789.
"Blowed but not defeated, " Giffords talks in his first interview on TV since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot firearm in an act constituting Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (democrat by Arizona) appeared on the national television on Monday night, sang accompanied by Broadway's melody "The Sun will rise tomorrow" and said he wanted to recover more than he wanted to go back to Congress.
In his appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented its difficult path back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and passed from front to back of his head.
Three months ago, he was surprised to return to the Chamber to issue his triumphant vote in the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the shooting in January, he killed six and laughed at 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, 41-year-old Giffords replied, "Very well."
The interview with Giffords and his husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special "20/20" program of an hour long, which was broadcast on the evening of the publication of the new book of the couple, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special programme analysed the recovery of Giffords since the shooting on January 8.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar through her front.
She can only keep one or two fingers up, while her husband encourages her.
Months later, he sees Giffords sitting in a wheelchair while the therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A lipstick.
And then his first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords spoke another word - "totest", a request for change in his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: It is seen to the congressman singing with therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cindy Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, two hours of therapy every day, he said he didn't remember the shooting day.
Her husband said that he was reading to Giffords an article in the newspaper on the murder of March 12 when she stopped to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspicious gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and is being cured by the force while awaiting trial.
"Many people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that in a moment of recovery of his wife, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,' said Kelly.
"You've just been hit.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever."
The troops make me feel more sorry than I do
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a dance about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, a number of hundreds of soldiers, sailors, aviators and children of the marine broke up in their positions around him.
The crowds of labels stood up and applauded.
"The men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the collection of spring funds.
A high-ranking military officer in the gala, also known as then President of the Joint Major State, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were shown as an orphan child," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The highly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has been enjoyed by the military and a United States public often far away, sometimes, as a worshiper.
It is given to troops with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, the members of the service say.
The public is increasingly acting as if those uniforms are being punished.
"We are not at all victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who ordered the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put us in the role of the desolate souls."
The topic is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
It is also noted that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of Vietnam's war was much worse.
As a result, most of the conversations on the scourge are conducted in silence and in private among war veterans.
After his two children returned to fight with the Navy Infantry, the retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be "an angry and violent vet under the surface," Cancian said, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had kindly asked him whether he would be able to endure under pressure from a demanding job in Washington immediately after his fight.
"When you talk about your service, you need to deal with the negative impressions," Songan reminded his children.
The military concerns arise, in part, from the American indifference towards war.
The achievements in the battlefield are rarely elected for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefits from the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism in ways that were most common in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who ordered US troops in Afghanistan.
On the other hand, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to end the rape
This week, a historical hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged liability to the rape.
If not, hundreds of applicants are being organized for the following.
The first soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 and 11 weeks pregnant the night she said she was raped by a companion.
It was October 2008, and it was sent back to its headquarters at Miramar Air Base, in the north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who had a 12-page beer package.
He asked her if she could join her in her room for a drink.
"It's an alarm signal," Lyman says.
However, the native of Texas left behind her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's Texas," he says.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached her behind, throwing her down and raping her, claiming.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of current and former military personnel look forward to a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the claim they have filed against the Secretary of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to trial.
The claim claims that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in reducing the widespread violation among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, D.C., the claim initially involved 17 applicants, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all affirming that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their companions, and that the army failed at the time of investigation, prosecution, or appropriate justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says he's going for the army's biggest plan, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure up below," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals?
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of which could be part of future demands.
Your strategy: Instead of accumulating all the applicants in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, it will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The Defence Team for the Department of Defence, headed by Federal Prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy - essentially, that soldiers cannot be prosecuted by current or former soldiers for injuries suffered by the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court judgment called Doctrine Feres, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by staff in active service.
"The alleged damage is part of the military service of the claimants," the documents say.
The Department of Defence refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, armed women's teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in areas of war.
The result: between those two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two thirds of them have been killed in combat situations.
It's time the army is modernized, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are under way, besides hers.
At Yale Law School, the Legal Services Clinic for Veterans is preparing a case against the four main military academies by allegedly promoting a misogynous environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is making a claim against the army that focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" assigned to victims of rape in order to give them the highest level of service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Network of Women's Action in Service, a group of human rights.
His group filed a complaint against the Veterans Administration in December, accusing it of discriminatory practices in how it manages claims of benefits for persons claiming to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been submitted to Congress by a two-party mixture of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Aggression and Response of the Department of Defence.
However, the aggressions are reportedly below, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, which is estimated to be about 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the trial rates: in 2010, about 20 per cent of the cases reported in the army were tried - half as in the civil justice system.
The applicants in Burke's case, describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he reported alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he said, he was asked to count the details of his rape 11 times different from a multitude of police, doctors, and commanders.
She was subjected to a rape kit, and the blood of her attacker--from a cut in her arm--was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked whether he would have had sexual relations with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons declared to be personal witnesses on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to work--I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember telling my commanding officer, "That wasn't your judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, he was granted the service under less-than-honorable terms, which prevents him from receiving any benefit.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his fellow applicants continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, professor of Law at the George Washington Faculty of Law.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What lies between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence that places responsibility.
And he adds, "Probability is strongly against them... but it's important for them to try it."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go on its way, Burke, lawyer of the applicants, he'll put his other hundreds of applicants on the queue for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform takes place," he says.
"Or until we wall up, what happens first.
The walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another type of anti-immigration approach.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having committed a murder in Norway in July, who left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: he had spent most of his time attacking his computer, talking to some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups in social networks.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - you only have to go into Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British study centre DEMOS.
The personal information ally of Facebook is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy - the way sellers have been using for years.
The Bartlett team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then directed ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future.
On arriving through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 extreme-right parties in 11 European countries - everything without leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way to do an investigation," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not quite surprising: Online party members of right-wing groups tend to be young, men and angry with immigration.
However, in a kind of tour, "those who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind the computer screen."
DEMOS work is just an example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in the "I like", messages on the walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook's "supernova data" is generating an increase in research, stimulating the number of academic works with the name of the site in the title up to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, Facebook's beauty is that it allows you to study people you couldn't approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you tried to interrogate people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to go through the party, and they would never allow you access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook removes all that - go to them directly."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his colleagues found that university students who talked about their drinking habits on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as residential consultants, could control the site and intervene to help a student who publishes too many state updates with his drunks.
"You can't deal with a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development of the Child at the Seattle Child Research Institute, Washington Post said.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk that would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "pinning" your own population to get data.
The Site Data Team has compiled statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the mid-2010 legislative period, and an index of National Happiness (mainly using the information that can be accessed - digital freedom defenders long ago who argue that the site should make available to others its large amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, they like it or not - the sacrifice for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to allow me your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know?
While researchers have well defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought that a researcher might be examining their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study that he conducted with students' public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then it's the question of methodology.
Even off-line, there is no guarantee that a topic of research is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of a user's profile information and messages on the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do out of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
That is why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paper and a handwriting are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute to enter the real world and talk to the real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of social still happens offline."
"Free and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in the court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a combatant of "resistance" during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Norwegian Temple Knights," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
"I oppose the court because it has received the mandate of organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I'm not guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "I didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform for expressing his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who delivered a written speech in advance, to address the families of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik under custody for 12 more weeks, banned access to the media for four weeks, and said the authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and family members of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came with the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that he was locked under a key.
All attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it was cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian NRK station.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark blue corbate suit, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a major "resistance" movement, the judge determined that it was not a mental illness, and said that there was no evidence that she acted with complicity.
Some may find it comforting that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist instead of a radical group.
But that does not automatically ease the pain and confusion that a whole nation still feels.
"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't look like it," said a victim's family.
"It would be much easier if it looked like it."
7 Lessons of Steve Jobs' Lost Interview, shown in a theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Inventor Modern.
But what Apple fans could find more revealing, in an interview with recently re-discovered Jobs, which has been demolished as the advance of a series of special projections in the major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the commercial processes and workflows of products.
It was no doubt a self-recognised designer, dreamer and hippie, but it was also a methiculous organizer and a yonki of flow diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffered "a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds (The Triumph of the Fools) on the trees of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time, it had been almost 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, awaiting popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of the Cringely interview was used in Nerds, he said the original interview disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Job's death that a complete copy of VHS was discovered in the director's garage.
This file material, slightly re-edited, is Steve Jobs' base: The lost 68-minute interview, which comes to the Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate the in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and commercial strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points along the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly suspending his thoughts, looking for accuracy.
There are also times when the perfectionism of Jobs comes up to the surface, where it seems impatient because of the questions of Crinely, pushing him to go faster to the topics or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the Pixar era, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and wrong, and offers their own vision of the future of computer science.
One thing is to read posthumous evaluations of Job's career, but there's something cruel and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, the dreamer anxious about the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how they can and must be things.
Not long after I told him everything in detail here, he was and did it.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how you learned to take a business:
"During the years in the business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers that give you invariably are, "Oh, that's just the way you do."
Nobody knows why he does what he does, in business nobody thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs brings in detail their efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Unconcerned by the way the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made to the eye of good cover, and then adjusted with a "variable" - developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine the commercial costs in detail.
On the Pope's joke:
Jobs tells the "Blue Box" that he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hack the phone company effectively and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been widely written about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here when describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
Describe how he and Wozniak tried the box using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were involving things around the world a half dozen times and yelling through the public phone and returning a minute later to the public phone at the side door," says Jobs with a laugh.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
The two of us, we didn't know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing--it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak to the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the U.S. diplomat, the two broke into barracks just before the pope too was awakened to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling it by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, he searched for spare parts to build a frequency counter, and he called Bill Hewlett on the phone.
Shortly after his 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job in Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had ever seen at that age and it formed my vision of what a company was and how well they dealt with their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer ever made".
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with him.
I'd get a trip to HP as a teenager and lose time with that machine and write programs for her.
About improvising innovation:
In several points of the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the march.
Soon in his career, as he dedicated himself to selling a handful of basic plates, a customer asked him if he could mount the entire equipment.
Working only 30 days of credit, I had to find out how to mount and deliver the finished devices.
Later, while in Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in the development of a computer mouse:
"I agreed to have dramatic arguments... I was shouted that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got bored and I went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and it was totally reliable.
About large companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple's rebirth, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble in his vision, and lose control of his market share.
"Say you're working on IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better photocopiers and printers, and what?"
You have the monopoly of the market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase their success, so these are the kind of people who end up leading companies and people in charge of products are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to this monopoly is driven by people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary office.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have been fed by the whole computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an artistic expression:
"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows."
Much is learned about the subtleties of the same.
There are sacrifices you have to make - some things you can't do to the electrons, the glass makes them, the robots make them, the factories make them.
You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
After all, everything is reduced to taste - it is down to trying to expose yourself to the best that a human team has done, and then try to adapt those things to what you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed of stealing big ideas.
What made Macintosh in part great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, it could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with rivals of the health care law while the court accepts the case
The day the Supreme Court met at a closed door to examine the politically controversial issue of whether they would accept the challenge of President Obama's health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were held at a dinner sponsored by the firm's firm that will present the case to the High Court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a request submitted by 26 states challenging the total reform of health assistance approved by the Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists throughout the country.
The magistrates agreed to accept the request and, in fact, a 5 and a half-hour historical claim is expected for March, and the result will probably further disturb the 2012 presidential career, which will be in full custody at the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and claim that the law must be dropped will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. general prosecutor during George W. Bush's government.
Clement's firm Bancroft PLLC was one of almost two dozen companies who helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been dedicated to defending the conservative legal principles for many years.
Another signature that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held in a Washington hotel, hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the assistants was Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate, and a declared opposer of the health care law.
The special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
There is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal judges.
If they did not, it could be said that they would fall under the Canon 4C Code, which says: “A judge may attend events to collect funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge cannot be a speaker, a guest of honor, or be included in the program of such an event.”
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
"This impressive break of ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several judges who comply with the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges were sentenced to a collection of gala funds with lawyers who have pending cases before the court."
Its appearance and assistance in raising funds for this event undermined any demand for impartiality, and it is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in critics who say they mix the court's activity too easily with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is the judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as Attorney General of Obama's Administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressured Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying he was too involved in defending the law as for now to be impartial.
Kagan has given no indication of what I'm going to do.
Boeing receives a record request of $18 billion
The Emirates airline requests 50 double Boeing 777, with an option of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner planes to Oman Air, an operation worth over a billion dollars.
It is rarely news when a company receives a request from 50 units of its product.
But it's a big deal when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 aircraft is up to a record of $18 billion.
It is as big as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold mine growing from future requests for aircraft.
In a study known as Monday, Chicago's company estimates that over the next 20 years, airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend his biggest order of history for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - 50 Boing 777 double jets.
The successful request came from the Emirates airport in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes, which would raise the total sales price to $26 billion, Boeing announced in the Dubai Aeronautics Chamber 2011.
Then on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had requested six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which assumed a fuel saving and a service for spectacular passengers.
The selling price for six of them is over a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect on Boeing," said Morningstar Neal Dihora analyst.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay the planes, but it is an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - it is not so harmful, because the country is making money with the increase in oil prices.
This is important because they have fewer chances than other airlines to cancel or delay the flight orders when fuel prices increase, Dihora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The request of the Emirates solidifies Boeing’s leadership in the wide-ranging aviation market and helps to keep your Airbus SAS competitor’s attempt to invade his domain with the A350 passenger plane.
Boeing's victory at the air fair takes place four months after Airbus said it was going to delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
He delayed the start to add more impulse after customers demanded an increase in the useful load and the range.
Boeing Co's shares increased by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the Michoacán vote
Luisa María Calderón claims that drug traffickers helped their opponent of the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the argument for governor.
President Felipe Calderón's sister seems to have lost her candidacy with the governor of Michoacán during the elections of the violent state, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers helped to turn the race towards one of their opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the Western state governor's career in Fausto Vallejo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, above all, yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the entire country," Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview one day after the vote on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our electorate workers... they took hold of the urns, installed barricades... and ordered the people to vote" in favour of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
However, it is the stage of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have crossed a small margin in Calderón, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calderón, a candidate for the Conservative National Action Party of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognise Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the office of governor, was in third place, a great defeat for the left divided and unfortunate prior to the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the mayor of the capital of Morelia, refused links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the native state of President Calderón, and he elected Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has continued.
A PAN mayor was murdered a week before the elections while he campaigned for Luisa María Calderón, and many candidates abandoned the local applications for fear.
Although for the PRI, because of the unpleasant appearance of the Michoacán elections, a victory will help drive the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, facing next year."
BAsD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the euro area from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, director-general of the Asia Development Bank based in Manila, said that the two largest economies of world growth had to "do everything possible" to speed up the recovery of the economic block already outside the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe Europe's difficulties in a "impartial" way and said that Asia's financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview within the framework of the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it can't be immune."
"So if China and India can help, that's all the media."
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In the last few days, Italy's debt costs have been severely dropped and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have given up.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased the fear that it could push the global economy to recession and has generated calls for the main emerging economies to join in helping the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU ransom fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered a greater negotiating power for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, said that "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering the fall of exports and the exhaustion of foreign capital entries.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when facing their own and deep economic problems.
Ashtosh Warsaw, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically difficult to sell aid to Europe for the billions of two hundred thousand people in India, of whom up to 800 million live about $2 a day or less.
"At some point it will be realized that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and leave for vacation at the beaches and that will not fall well," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, was also asked why India's reservations should be used to maintain the numerous and well-paid workers in the Greek public sector, in positions of poorly managed companies, and in the generation of losses such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatens with "significant chain effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank forecast of 7.5 per cent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing the "risks to the bottom" due to Europe's threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outages from their economies.
Serious Pentagon warnings about possible defence cuts
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, heated the Congress on Monday, warning that automatic budget cuts that are in place could undermine national security and cause a financial reaction in chains from the passages of the Pentagon, to the battle fields of Afghanistan, to the civil assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already spending $450 billion of reductions over the next decade, but now it fears an additional reduction of 600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequences, the so-called "abductor", would result in 23 per cent of global reductions and a high number of new projects.
"A cut so large, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our ship and construction projects impossible to run - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to leave many of our civil servants in an involuntary manner and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to fire civilians in order to meet the objective."
"These changes would break faith with those who keep our army and would seriously damage the good mood."
The time cuts would reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
"Although the financing for wartimes in the ultramarine contingent operations accounts is not directly affected by kidnapping, war's efforts would be adversely affected by the serious damage to the core budgets," Panetta warned.
" Staff recruitment would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and supervision of the war-supported contract."
"Nominee staff would be reduced, giving rise to delays in payments to wartime suppliers, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, requesting information on the possible impact of automatic cuts in the Department of Defence.
"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defence would cause a rapid decline in the United States as the world's main military power."
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon when they published the letter from Panetta.
"This is not a result that you can live with, and certainly it is not one that we should impose on ourselves."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the interests of the national security of the United States, and it should not be allowed to happen."
Whether Panetta's letter and the senator's recent warnings will increase the pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls for exemptions from the Pentagon of the cuts are to be seen.
Panetta has been more and more frank about possible cuts, although she has come to work at the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets at Congress and the White House and knowing she faced difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a nucleus.
"It's a boat without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of quarters, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to carry out the mission," Panetta said in her opening words in the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morals, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with the potential opponents."
"In fact, he invites the aggression..."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta presents new details of how the reductions "make significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and previously committed around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could deal with the strike, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new scheduled bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and the Navy need to replace, the Humvee.
Detaining F35's additional development and testing could generate some $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its partners say it is the next vital step to improve and address China's potential threats and other rivals.
How to Detect a Lie
A look at the most recent headliners tells us how serious and omnipresent are the deception and the lie in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging sexual harassment charges with several women; each party accuses the other of lying.
The managers of the State University of Pennsylvania have been accused of perjury by allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was "piled" with an open microphone claiming to the president of the United States, Barack Obama, that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies have destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The congressman from New York and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made the joke with his scorns quickly defeated by the irrefutable test.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with offences in financing the campaign related to the coverage of an extra-marriage relationship.
And again, no one who will live him will ever forget the media circuit that President Bill Clinton has left when he lies during his second term of office about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinsky.
The legends about traps in school and university exams are very extensive.
There have been cases where teachers have given the students' answers to the exams in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Men who should be teaching the contrary are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On any day, the studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That sure, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that the unknown lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
To detect lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a table game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to proclaim: "I have you", the detection of deception is a branch of knowledge would be based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities that conducted deep research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lie have been defeated.
The liars do look to the eyes.
Not always tartamudean, balbucean, ruborize or worry.
Neither can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, the microfaceal expressions, the formation of questions and times.
I spent several years researching scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help navigate through our complex world - especially if its professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, or negotiation management.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that the extroverts lie more than the introverts, that men say more "false towards themselves", while women say more lies "oriented towards others" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often to their mates than those who are not married (but the lies that they usually say tend to be "orphant").
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty when lying to you.
How do you know if anyone's lying?
First, observe the usual conduct of the subject.
This is called "creating a base line".
Helps to provide reference points to measure after changes.
Observe the attitude of the subject, laughter and vocal characteristic.
It's better to know if someone normally hits the foot all the time to not make unfair accusations when he sees his feet beating in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for misleading, verbal and non-verbal behavioural groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as alarm signals, not as evidence of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body by trying to remember their history, can point their feet towards the door, lean towards an exit, change their attitude significantly, or display a "post-trench" -- that excessive sigh of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions have ended.
Questionnaires often make it false that the interview has ended only to seek that post-trench relief.
He also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson put his foot to the bottom and used the past time as he claimed his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for her at the national level.
People who cheat can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relations with that woman... Miss Levinsky" or repeat a difficult question completely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question, "Well... to tell the truth... until I... understand."
This makes the response a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve the possibilities of anyone to avoid being victimized by fraud artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial oil pipeline plan derogated from the US delay in its adoption
Days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline planned from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering the trade unions, while peaceing with the environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to guide it again.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and trusts that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada director Alex Purbax says the company maintains its confidence that in time the pipeline is approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This came after the announcement last week by the Department of State that they would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until new potential routes to avoid the Nebraska Sandhills areas and Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater, were studied.
"This is a real way of progress," said the representative Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Department of State is possible to separate any decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although officials refused to be involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the Department of State, and expressed his full support to them.
The oil pipeline, from 1,700 kilometers, would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To that end, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by the environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who have been betting on the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But the legislators of Nebraska opposed to the plan are suspending legislation to force a distance from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study of the Department of State found that the project had only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the Department ' s general inspector had ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is if a signature that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle demanded by allegedly causing a child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the diva of disco music, Patti LaBelle, was acting like a lunatic in the lobby of her Manhattan building, landing her little daughter to the point that she was afraid.
The diathropist of the singer "Lady Marmalade" frightened Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, so much so that he suffered "change of personality, sleep disorders" and "increased his fear of strangers", says his family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was on 10 November last year when the tram driver Kevin Monk, his wife, Rosaanna, teacher of the kindergarten, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Rosaanna Monk went down to the vestibule of the Riverside Boulevard building, with his luggage, taking him to Geneva.
Rosanane Monk said he stood near the door and put his daughter on the ground for a moment.
"Someone came in behind and said to me, 'You know what your daughter is doing?' I said to her, 'Yes' and I went to pick her up,' she said.
LaBelle showed angry at the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "He shouldn't have left his daughter near the door," said Rosanad Monk.
"I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He got angry and began to use bad words - the word C and the word J in a loud voice...
He had a bottle of water and he started throwing the water out of the bottle over me."
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter," said the girl's mother.
LaBelle got tired of her mother -- who was still subject to Genevieve -- and had to be held in her room and taken off to a car waiting for her, Rosaanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so hard that she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but did not receive an answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not return the calls to comment on the incident.
The claim seeks unspecified damage, but the family lawyer Sam Davis said that he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to give all the money that can be obtained by a cancer child support association.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for her conduct," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially when addressing a teacher of a child's garden who carries in her arms an 18-month-old child."
Climate adverse inhibited the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality have increased, foreign investment has fallen, and the economy has become less competitive.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-denominated of the change, which has generated great expectations for economic progress, but given the climate of the beginning of the year, there is no growth, but a deterioration is recorded in the main indicators of economic development.
Low fevers in February, in addition to causing millions of losses to the agricultural sector, limited the potential of the state economy to grow, caused a decrease in overall economic activity of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of the impact on the ice, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was caused to 582,835 hectares of cultivated crops, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main crops sown were vegetables, maize and barley.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of State unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was seen as an accelerated growth, as while from January to March 55,053 Signaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Economically Active Population, for the second quarter the rate rose to 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a rate that in the number of people who cast more than 74 thousand signoloans, an increase in respect of the first half of 18 thousand,969 individuals.
Less Liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the U.S.A., growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions taken since public policy.
"What is being seen is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market for the purposes of a restriction of resources by the legislation adopted at the Congress to combat money laundering, as for people who take dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work, invest them and use them in something," he said.
Organisation
López Cervantes noted that in the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the state looking for work abroad in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties in entering, and second because entering has already had many difficulties in finding work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the labour market in Signaloin is exacerbated by considering the high level of informality that prevails between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the state-occupied population is working without being quoted as a worker before any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state's labour cuts is low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Labour and Social Preservation Secretariat.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much below the national average, located in 7 thousand 375 pesos.
IED contraction
In addition to the drop in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011, the highest decrease in direct foreign investment over the past 10 years was recorded, according to the State Economy Secretariat from January to June of the State IED amounted to $630,697, representing a fall of 87.74 per cent in respect of the $5 million, 143,312 recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the Government accounts for a total investment of 17 billion 280 million per year, mainly of enterprises in the tertiary sector.
The debt
Prior to the economic contraction stage, the Government of the State requested the State Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion weights, even to invest in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, the approval of the local congress was 2 billion 600 million weights, and until November they had not observed the benefits of debt in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, including the government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land we have lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, it failed to align the efforts of all, and above all the well-synchronized march of this new team of governments, we hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Economic Longitude
Loredo López said that events like the early ice creams of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including ice-creams, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not return fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services, and therefore, at the end of the year, we are closing much below our expectations," he said.
Redefine vocation
For Theodore Salazar Uriarte, president of the Mexican Patronal Confederation in Sinaloa, stated that the state is required to engage in productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general we have observed that we have been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme in which the vocation and economic direction of the state are redefined, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has, is detached," he said.
Work to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that best matches the efforts of the Government.
"In general, I would say that the Government has been trying to deliver good results in various areas, but there are some progress in economic development, but it is important that a long-term programme be developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way of leading public policy.
"There are elements that allow to say that the Government is becoming more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I believe that the Government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
Condemned by 8 kg of marijuana
At five years' imprisonment and 100 days' imprisonment, a neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to eight pounds of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic reported that the drug addict was Omar Alexis Valenzuele Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for trade purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuel Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010, in a surveillance operation on the street of Cipriano Valdez, in front of position 80, in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The Narcomendist circulated on a pick-up truck, white, where he carried a black bag in the vehicle box and in the co-pilot seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured remained at the disposal of the District Judge and the sentence continued within the Centre for the Enforcement of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
Contributions for works
Social activities covered by programs such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that while the work programmes have so far progressed, they are at risk of failing to comply with the State Government's contributions, which amount to more than 11 million weights in the three programmes.
He noted that the total investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million weights, of which 25 per cent was the State and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for the work, so that the possible delay in the conclusion of these programmes became effective.
"It's almost 12 million that matters to them and despite the fact that the year is about to end they haven't given us a fifth, when since July they had to give us a part," he said, "we've started the works and gone very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million who did not provide the state administration on that occasion.
"It happened to us in the previous season because the State had no economic capacity to participate and the programmes continued to walk, and this year in order to be able to access these programmes, we had to get the resources to cover what the State had left behind," he said.
Despite the commitment of the State authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, has been requested to speed up efforts to ensure that the percentages corresponding to them reach as early as possible.
"It's almost 12 million that matters to them, and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they haven't given us a fifth."
Valid "analogic apegon" cut in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has ever experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional disputes raised by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that was proceeding with the so-called "analogous apegon" from 2021 to 2015, when the eight votes needed to invalidate it were not met.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed in his duties by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to concrete the transition to terrestrial digital television.
As a result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was disappointed that the qualified majority of eight votes were not reached in order for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or inconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft judgment, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed that the decree be declared unconstitutional because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), contrary to the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and in accepting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it for the digital transition.
The full of ministers also resolved to reject the request submitted by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also under Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the project's arguments, so that the Federal Executive could not structure through general rules the measures for the preparation of the public administration.
"I also do not think that if I did, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector would correspond to the federal executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the State rectorate.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that the world has experienced in recent years, and it is translated into a better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
To postpone the change, it would be to delay the benefits of digitisation, which entails a decision of public interest, which does not only have a technical dimension, "which may cover economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "needs the operation of the whole system established, in accordance with the principle of economic governance of the State, to include a group of tasks which the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, which somehow invaded the sphere of competence of Congress, is being provided in the administrative field for compliance with laws issued by the Legislative, ensured.
Analyses the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data provided by the PREP, the difference between the first and second seats of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even though the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total records are not accounted for.
The possibility of the "voting by vote" count is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data provided by the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (PREP) the difference between the first and second seats of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, although the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total records are not accounted for.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IMM), Mary of the Landing Angels Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, only on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As you will recall, Michoacán did not approve his Political Constitution or his Electoral Code of the State or his Electoral Justice Act, but the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period so that they could enter into force in this electoral process, and Governor Leonel Godoy Range omitted its publication within the time limits provided for in the Official Journal of the State Act, with the argument that it had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the State Ombudsman on constitutional reforms, but did not have the right to "sanction them or vet them".
Interviewed about the possibility of the "vote by vote", Maria de los Llandales explained that the adoption of the relevant guidelines by the General Council of the IEM would enable partial and total accounts of the vote by the local electoral body to be made possible.
In this way, the partial vote count, of one or more electoral packages, may be provided in the assumption that: the results of the records do not match; there is no record of vote and a summary in the file of the case or does not open in the power of the President thereof; or, where there are obvious errors or alterations to the records.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all election boxes may be made when there is evidence that the difference between the alleged candidate who won the election and who has obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an express request from the party representative and/or coalition who applied for the second of the nominated candidates.
The total voting count may also be made if at the end of the ordinary computer it is established that the difference between the allegedly winning candidate and the second-place candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the political party's representative whose candidate remained second, in which case the electoral packages that have been partially accounted for will be excluded.
It should be noted that in this situation the choice of Morelia is in place, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 per cent, although not counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total records.

Three men were found killed by bullets in different parts of the body and with the grace shot, in a abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government facing a crisis that has placed that country on the brink of economic disaster
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has put the whole euro area at risk.
A communiqué from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected that it will present a cabinet composed in its majority by technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will take over.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "mark is now well-designed," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package required by European leaders to recover the blow of confidence in Italy.
Stressing the pressure on Monti to hurry, market instability put the performance of the Italian BTP bonds to 10 years above 7 per cent, the level to which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian patronage Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Monti's success prospects were greatly driven by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, to whom the crisis forced the break-up of Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to have a good outcome," Angelino Alfano, the secretary of the centre right party, told the press.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the government of the majority of technocrats who are forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added pressure to warn that Monti's failure would be a disaster.
Monti started consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
He'll put an end to his round of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a short breath at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.8 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences of the euro area.
Monti has said that his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the generalized predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections proceed.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insist that he should be made up only by technicians, an indication of his repairs to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources noted that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties were complicated in the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish rock is higher than the tics
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten win the 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica only one of the 22 called arrived at the 50 meetings.
A major contrast to Costa Rica, when compared to the 22 called by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the San José National Stadium.
While World Champions and Europe, number one of the FIFA's monthly rankings, account for a wide record of class A inter-selecting games, Tricolor alone owns the defender Michael Humana as the only one who has the 50 international parties.
That figure reached her last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers playing in the League of Stars and in the powerful clubs of the England Premier League maintain an intense activity annually in league championships and domestic cups, and high-level shocks in European teams such as Champions League.
The experience with the Spanish Furia is combined with the complicated eliminations of the Eurocopa and the World of Football.
The typical football players, on the other hand, have a limited international rock in an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish Selection is of the Archer Iker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) equaled the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play before the Tricolor today and will set up a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's brain wheel, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other hundreds of Iberian teams, the so-called Zubizarreta with 126 and the Shalke ariette, Raúl González, with 102.
Nearly 100 is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Inista, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tic side, and close to Michael Umuña, are the left side Junior Day, with 48 presences and the artillery Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five games exceeded: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
At least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not start.
The historical golfer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 days, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who registers more than nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its two decades tour tour
"And Costa Rica is a dream made of reality"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Bahist Jeff Ament, from Pearl Jam, said the band is ready to offer one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the band ensures that for them it will also convert the dream to play in the country.
Thus the basilica and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two-departure tour and Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the Angeline Band The X and the Nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extract of the conversation, whose full transcription is on The Nation on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican followers, is it a dream made of reality that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream made reality for us too.
This is only our second time in South and Central America and has so far been great.
I've been to Costa Rica only once and for vacations; it's such a beautiful country and I think we're gonna be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to take our music there.
I wonder why there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live intensely the previous days.
What do your most zealous followers say?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so long and we regret it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've ever played in the last 21 years have happened in the last couple of weeks.
We play a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that has shaped us for this concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they find out Costa Rica and their waves to surf?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are incredible.
My friends were always going to surf Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we understood, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they've been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we've never touched there before, then we have no restriction on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this all about?
I think it's partly because we have nine discs and we can play more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we take the time not to touch, it keeps us focused and it keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we could have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting to us and, therefore, I think it also becomes more interesting to people.
With this tour, they're celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they have achieved?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us imagine that we would be in a big rock band and have done it for over 20 years that it looks like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love and love to create music.
We are happy to go to places in the world that we always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of big bands.
We are very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a movement emerges from a group of friends and it's a little unusual.
From time to time, a band of a city emerges, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we came to Soundgarden in his tour, so we are happy to be friends of all of them still and honor us to be part of that sound of Seattle that came up.
It is also very strange that a band like yours is kept together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands last.
First of all, I think we're all happy to be still alive, and secondly, we're all worried about the others.
We are all very close friends and thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone the freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the famous word has not been simple; however, thanks to their success, they have been able to do what they want.
How do they find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier to find a balance.
We make sure you don't be too busy because it's easy to fall into that game of the great crowds and the people who love your music.
While one remembers that people are there for music, that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it, without worrying about being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and never published a record until after Andrew Woods died.
There were many frustrations because it lasted so much and most importantly, that we were still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I heard a song or I saw a photo of the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was a surprising human being and we surprised him.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your job, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with various proposals and that was the band we liked most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining.
Why do they always change Yellow Ledbetter's letter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that happens to him.
As a basilica, what are their influences?
They're so many.
Among the first to happen to me are Geezer Butler, John Enwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so much I could talk all afternoon about the Bajaists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge relevant despite being no longer fashionable?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the grunge word.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that emerged at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now doing better than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now has become more positive.
What is this change due to?
It's interesting because I think there's a couple of songs in the new album that may seem more light, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched them, I wept when I heard them and they were deeply dark songs.
I think that when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a family or a friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is again hospitalized for medical examinations
The former president Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated by the loss of muscle strength presented in the legs, his head doctor reported.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who carries out a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including a cancer in the language by which he has been operated four times and is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told the TV channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of the pain and loss of strength of its lower members.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he did not want it because he is known to be innocent.
It was operated four times as cancer in the tongue, it has a weight loss of 18 kg to which other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis have been added, pancreas cyst, kidney calculations, arterial hypertension, and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor mentioned.
Fujimori has been incarcerating since September 2007 at the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 persons at the hands of an army squadron who secretly operated in the first years of his government.
Music travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, headed by the Uruguayan president José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will launch a visit to Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican couple, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive meeting agenda with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with Uruguayan communities living in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "proposal for the exchange of information in all political matters between the two nations", according to the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France when French envoy Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those remaining tax havens from the international community, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultation with its ambassador in the European country.
Since November, Mexico has presided over the G20, a group composed of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country, since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has been trying to speed up the conclusion of tax exchange agreements in order to emerge from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), formed by countries that have not implemented all international tax cooperation standards.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Treaty of Free Trade (TLC) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The bigoto fountain passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the arrows of the evil Bowser, but never so far had done it in three dimensions: "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to shops from around the world, has been designed from a beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows to play in three dimensions without needing to use glasses.
"Mario is the character that has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said Nintendo's press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Alvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for that support", since so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman said that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Alvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "sensilla" to trap the less skilled users.
Once it is over, the most experts will be able to give a "second" back to the levels of the game, which this time have more difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario into the three dimensions also implies the return of the character to a portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo gives guides to the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of success of previous deliveries, which is that the source of the bigot will have to use mines of danger to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a Luigi "playable".
Column down the Portillo extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that he went through the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for the conspiracy of US$70 million.
This concludes the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to judge it there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was due to the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that an extradited court had already ordered extradition.
He stated that during his term of office, he "did not put his hands" in judicial resolutions and handed him over to all extraditions he had known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited, for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Road Morales and Victor Road Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What was done by Colom is an executive procedure after all the judicial and constitutional bodies were exhausted to process the ex-mandate between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), the Portillo must be extradited once its legal situation has been resolved in Guatemala and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted by the defamation of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process prior to extradition, but the Ministry of Public Affairs appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The institution was born to avoid the fall in the marginality of children without training
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support institution is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation over this quarter of the century.
This adds the hundreds of jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served to balance yesterday in an event held in the former factory complex of Fabra and Coats to which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinidad Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with low education, unemployment, degradation or marginalization problems.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of entities and institutions that have collaborated with the association over the past 25 years.
The various political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Along with the President of the Generality, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former Socialist Education Councillor Ernest Maragall, and current mayor and socialist councillor Richard Gomá attended the event.
They also went to the grand hall of Fabra and Coats the current councillor of Welfare Social and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the director general of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the present is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president set Trinijove as an example for learning to fight bad circumstances and to give hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Abandoned an occupied farm where macrophists were made
The invaders had taken 11 out of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupying left the bank on Wednesday yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that lived by the neighbors of the 51st Street of Balmes has come to an end.
Twelve people left the house that they illegally occupied yesterday at noon, and where they organized macrofiists who were desperate for their neighbors, in judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from being repeated.
"From now on there will be an access control," said the administrator.
The baths, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially bottles of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the municipal parties, which lasted up to two days and were desperate for the tenants.
Alongside the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
His owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied, the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque points out that the bank's invaders had unfair competition, since they sold the cups to three euros, while the discotheque was worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure area had to respond to neighboring complaints by noise, while, according to the point, the trouble did not provoke the customers of the discotheque, but the inhabitants of the occupied house and, above all, the attendees of the parties organized there, who had increased their frequency and intensity over the past few weeks, according to the neighbors of the area.
The head of the discotheque explained that the trouble was so great that he even agreed with the owner of the property and nine months ago "forgive him" the rental.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the past few weeks, he had received more complaints from his neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of PP in the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to immediately evict the property to end the problems of coexistence and civilism that produce neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one plant in the occupied building, but during the last months the occupations had gone into all the plants of the building and almost all the floors, and that thefts had occurred in any of them.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and to be determinant of the incisism that has been generated in the finca".
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police headed up to 35 on Mont-ral Street, following the call of a neighbor who had observed that four people had access to the building.
The four were arrested at the moment.
You park the mountain?
Architects match the opportunity of the summons beyond controversy about honorary
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, in full apoge of the already extensive Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed a series of promotion passports for Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
It was also accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park was once again located, in the imagination of many, such as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented in the north-south axis but above (mountain) -low (mar).
The rating of Collserola as a natural park is based on this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jabalis in the role of Yogi bear.
These were held until, in September, the town convened a megacompetition consisting of 16 competitions for so many other doors of access to Collserola.
A door leads to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Or that or someone is going to put doors in the field.
The question goes out alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The contest, both for its purely organizational point and for what is meant by reflection on the city, is the subject of conversation among all the Barcelonian architects.
It is almost already a recurring topic to be taken out of hand when two members of this former cast of electors are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact is just one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelonian architects, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "makes necessary" to discuss "the front of the mountain", while the discourse by Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, has not been held.
"From the base that Barcelona's most extensive park is the beach.
Among other things, because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect for whom the title of "Collserola doors" includes a "lexical tramp": it should not be thought of them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where action must be taken".
Modol, like Roland and Bayona with experience in the urban world, calls the proposal "intellectual network" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "insure that it is today to project public space" after the experience in the 80s and that it had in the Forum area "his corner of the cysne".
The first fear is the own delimitation of borders on where to build.
"Limiting something is the next step," i.e., its overpassing.
"There is a need to think about new urban instruments, planning, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (GMP) ] can lead to real disasters."
More censored to the question, Modol believes that by simplifying the valley stent of Collserola "it can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no", by a purely topographic question.
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by Collserola's patronate that "must not fall into broken bags", although he appreciates the opportunity the town offers to his jury to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the closeness of the mountain with the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether this is this technical profile that must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all one thing", points out) that they have to create: "The architects should be just a tool".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question given to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the competition there is no global vision of Collserola: "There have been 16 cross-cutting contests -i.e. in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole."
This results, at least in their case, that they have chosen to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can shock in program and definition with the architect of the side door.
In its view, that is what the town should ensure that the branch immediately above the Dalt Round should provide, in its entirety, a area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgive to Jonás Larrazábal and will release
After 72 days of drag, the legal takeover of the Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed by alleged blackmails
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal heir of the Red Casino will grant him forgiveness before the District Criminal Trial, which follows a process of blackmail against the mayor of Monterrey's brother.
After the attack on Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded payment of an economic quota so that the regional council would allow the clandestine operation of the betting house.
After the public complaint, the State Prosecutor opened a criminal trial against the Panista Mayor's brother and on 2 September he was arrested and detained for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Ministry Agent 3 in Patrimonial Offences, he was transferred to the House of Arraygo 1, located in the Antiquo neighborhood of the capital of the State.
In that place, there remained for the 49 days following the decree of a second law-enforcement order after the official of the Public Ministry dismissed the crimes of coercion and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to Cadereyta's prison for allegedly blackmailing with a million and a half weight to the owners of the Red Casino; however, only a few hours remained in the middle security prison as there were threats of death against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was ordered to be arrested by the Secretary of the District Criminal Justice, Jorge Yánez, who said that at almost two months of investigation, sufficient evidence had been provided to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the charge of 1.5 million pounds to the representatives of the betting house instead of allowing the operation of the latter.
This Monday, the legal heir to Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gomez, approached Judge José Luis Pecina to ask forgiveness for the local mayor's brother; so in the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal diligence, the official of the Public Ministry attached to Judge Ramiro Arias questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and which of the members of the betting house was the one that granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of the file 197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and no claim can subsequently be made about the process followed; in addition, no damages or punishment will be required.
After hearing the legal takeover of the betting house, about 15:50 the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The judge's secretary, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolas de los Garza to notify Jonah that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be archived.
He shall also notify it of the order of immediate liberty issued by the judge.
Dionsio Pérez Jacome gives details of the air accident where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, lost his life, and seven more people
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven more persons lost their lives indicate that the helicopter was directly affected on the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jacome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before disembarking the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the asps had contact with trees 25 meters where the unit lost the fuse."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it had the necessary requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he said that investigations carried out in the impact area did not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In a search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The helicopter design was for 19 passengers, with adequate requirements to transport passengers.
The ground has a seven-degree slope at 30 degrees slope.
At the moment, the Secretary assured that it was a priority to count on the results that had been possible; however, the investigation could take several months, even one year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Major State operated at cruising speed and that this happened in a rising soft terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the SCT holder, Pérez Jacome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical policy the flight was conducted under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during flight and ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the ICM provided adequate conditions for the landing, as the aircraft moves towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico presented low-height clouds.
Selected paths:
It is likely that because of the cloudy conditions, the crew has sought a lower elevation area and greater visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Impact location.
Impact coordinates and the latest radar record coincide, probably before the impact, there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft residues in a reduced area:
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight and side-by-side route.
The aircraft residue dispersion pattern allows the helicopter to assume that the helicopter was affected on the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
On the site of the sinister there is no evidence on the rest of the ship of any kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that there could have been multiple contacts with the field.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an altitude of 9 billion 200 feet above the average sea level, the ground presents a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of tilt.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predicted to be decommissioned during that journey.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the thorough search in a wider area than the agreed site around the accident, no dispersal parts of the aircraft have been found, thus strengthening the presumption that the impact was presented in terms of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity genes
Directs Social Security an investigation to discover the gender of obesity in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the gender of obesity in children and young people, called the 'Genetic Protocol of Obesity of Children and Adolescence', which will allow for markers associated with overweight.
In a communiqué, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialities of the National Medical Centre of the 21st Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Political Institute (IPN).
The investigation invites participants to participate in the population, whether legally or not, to visit the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Mexico Valley, where the tests are carried out to minors, every Saturday from 8:00.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Ponient Mexico State) and that since 8 October, the activity has been carried out in the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Unit (East Mexico State).
Once the goal of meeting 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independent Sports Unit (South of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (North of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research was to know the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in children and young Mexicans to prevent the occurrence of degenerative chronic diseases.
When World Diabetes Day was held on 14 November, the goal was to gather three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 with the consent and supervision of their parents for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and history of hereditary diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger sufferings such as diabetes or renal impairment.
It detailed that Saturdays apply to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure taking, glucose determination, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (researched to identify genes associated with infant obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research is due to the concern of health professionals for the alarming increase in weight in children.
'The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of children, of 77 per cent in obesity, and in girls of 47 per cent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic rise was also observed', the IMSS specialist stressed.
It indicated that the justification for the search for markers is that the population of the country differs from others in its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 per cent of American Indian heritage, 30 per cent European and five per cent African, and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is translated into the inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calorie) and that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the participants is the full assessment of children, which enables them to detect whether they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark color folds (acantosis) in the neck and forearm, indicating the likelihood of metabolic and even prediabetic changes.
The information is handled in a confidential manner, and doctors give it to their parents in writing, who are told each of the measurements and changes in their lifestyle to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic suffering: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to high caloric intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugar drinks, carbohydrates (tamals, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would prevent bays
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Chemicals Faculty, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of the environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent by the floor were taken care of, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand basins each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemicals Faculty (FQ), who assured that if the construction and maintenance process of an asphalt floor is the right, the basins could be reduced in quantity or, even, completely eliminated.
At its conference A technological opinion of the basses, dictated in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, revealed that the laboratory is responsible for developing modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with a greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera felt that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, like some cities in the north, to improve its performance and therefore the formation of basins.
He explained that asphalt, the most heavy part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, some high molecular weights, called asphaltens, and others of low molecular weights, called maltenes, which together give the floor its distinctive viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt is that at high temperatures, near 180 degrees, it behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees centigrades its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees centigrades it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes broken, added.
The above means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform, but that it is changing during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, the specialist in chemical engineering warned.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible flooring, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, consisting of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that constitute the folder, pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
When passing the vehicles and generating efforts, it allows the forces to spread very well on the floor.
If they were asphalt modified, they would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt folder, it abounded, placed a last layer called a rolling folder, which is made of a fine stone material, i.e., a arena that also bathes in asphalt.
As it is the layer that will be in contact with the sides of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
As part of the floor that will receive and disseminate the efforts, the rolling folder also requires the appropriate thickness and the material that is made must be taken care of.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the ground is wet, the water spreads inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a rebound of all floors of the floor and therefore the formation of baths.
In the process of forming a ring, he said, the first to wear is the film of birth and only then affects the asphalt folder, but the damage does not happen instantly, but it is a process that should be followed by the first signals with appropriate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Investigators System also explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of the benches and therefore the thickness of each floor layer must always be related to the vehicle load and ensure that it is carried out, in order to avoid frequently forming benches.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already even on the market and allow the baths to be repaired easily and without needing to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna does not reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valle is entitled to the 14th Princess.
Once again the Valley of Cauca remains with the wishes of the Crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to conform to being on the winner's podium, shine the silver crown and the band that believed her as a new princess in Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where the Atlantic Miss raised herself with the crown and the cetro, the department has already added 14 titles of Princess and Melina to the legion of Valecaucan women who have been near the crown but who were princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvare (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many are asking is What was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Columbia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Rostro Jolie de Vogue, titles that obtained kingdoms such as Talia Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision that the jury made to appoint her First Princess is that she did not agree with her answer to the question "What is that book that marked you and why? done by Martín Murillo Gomez, of the Literary Carteta Leamos.
The interviewer the Valecaucan answered:
"I read a lot, I think a lot in literature, I think it's a way to culture, I definitely think that the book that marked me as a child is "The principle", it's a pretty deep book.
I am currently reading "Crime and Punishment" is a book of universal literature that we must all read; and today I am reading Irene Nemirovski's book, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Bourning of Blood".
A response that little liked first by the term "culturalize" and second by not specifically explaining how each of the books quoted had marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony, he felt calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise beyond what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little, "The principle" is a great book"
Among the hypothesises launched, it is said that Valle burned her favoriteism.
A Bogotan journalist suggested that when being the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who wore all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy network, public vote for the best craft, and Queen Mother), "this aroused the zeal of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage".
And that was noted in his first performance in bathroom on the Hilton beach and his two shows on the coronation veil.
Although both sides were confident, it was noted that he lacked the strength and momentum that Magdalena and Atlantic representatives had shown.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the program "As at home", of the Canal RCN, believed that the fact that Melina was designated a princess "make sure that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest does not remain as queen".
In addition, Valle was shown the last very wrong with the press, and there he was mistaken.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
For one thing, two days before the election, international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman engaged to the social needs of her parents.
"The beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, which before entering the Competition are already involved in projects," he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of his faults in the back and fibrosis that was noted to him in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
The queen's preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, which was better, "but her fibrosis problem in the abdomen, that the truth to me was not very familiar, dropped points on her last day."
Among other things, the journalist Guido Hoyos, from Cromos magazine, believes that the error of the Valecaucana was the surgical interventions that was performed.
"The surgeons are fine, but Valle is not supposed to do them.
Her body was never strong and here she was collected."
For this prize, which for the first time delivered the National Beauty Competition, after the show in the bathroom, there was a cruel Vatican that was performed last night, because it was said that this was the pleasure that Raymundo gave Melina to not give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, it is true that Melina has since now started a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international contests by appointing the National Competition itself.
However, she will pass to history as one of the kingdoms that, despite her scroller passing through Cartagena, she was blinded by the crown.
So it was the work of the road that identified Alfonso Cano's body.
A cali Lophoscopist went to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
Last November 4th, a CTI Lofoscopist from Cali went to history as the man who confirmed the identity of the chief of Farc: "Alfonso Cano", through the quote of his fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoscopists working in the ITC section, that week he was playing the "accessibility" shift to Eliaszar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the judicial investigation area for 21 years.
At the start of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Choco, where he often had to stay in the forest for more than five days to get to the site where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of the Valle and, after performing the corresponding courses, he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, that is, palm trees of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against Alfonso Cano aliases warned Elijah that he would wear minimum clothing for three days.
Something big was waiting for you.
On Friday night he left for the Cauca on a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being one of the man who led to the world's oldest guerrilla, so they asked him to carry Guillermo León Sáenz's decades-old card (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was located, he did not recognize it because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
I was without a beard, dressed as a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the leaves don't lie.
With a galtonian lamp, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eleazar compared the dental impressions of the body to those of the card.
His eye failed: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinzón, who was the chief of the Farc.
Searching for the trace
For a dentist from Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Elias González, in the press wheel for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our job.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without any error, which can become a key in crime resolution.
Apart from the identification of corpses, the Lophoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When they are caught, many criminals present fakes or do not have papers.
We take the fingerprint and search them in the database.
The investigator told him that in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, because at that place the thief had supported his hand to pull out a strong box full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to get a fingerprint, but in that case we could get the mark of the entire hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different hurdles," he recalled.
The traces may also discard or reaffirm suspects in cases of murder.
They recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a family could be suspected of crime and, indeed, a trace in the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he has been the killer, he does place him in the scene of the crime.
A CTI dactyloscope explained that in the objects "the traces are removed with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a transplantor or tape is used to lift them up.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He made it clear that not everything is as shown in the CSI TV program.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that touches becomes a sign.
However, if it can be used, if the respective quota is made.
The "indigested" challenge authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to the Zucotti Square to camp.
A large part attended the eviction order and moved to a nearby parish.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday to try again, under a judicial order, to Manhattan Square where they were evicted in the morning and to try to occupy another Grand Manzana park.
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access a court order that allowed the "infamous" to camp again in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the desert by occupying a further park north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will install ourselves somewhere else and we will continue the legal battle to return to Zucotti, as well as through peaceful sittings and demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the "infamous" to the disappearance of his camp, personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the place and allowed protesters to stay in camp.
In addition, the "infamous" took place in the occupation of a new park located in the confluence of the Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue centers, very close to the entrance to the Dutch tunnel, which is a New York and New Jersey, and property of the Trinity Church parish.
At least one hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the particular figure, while he assured Eph that he saw several journalists who were also married.
The organization ensures that several hundred people have been established at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved in support of the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the Police.
Meanwhile, the Zucotti Square - which is a private property unit - remains closed pending the conclusion of a judicial review scheduled for this same Tuesday, in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators who were displaced there carried and distributed copies of that court order to these hours and even handed them to the officers who were guarding the square, which caused "some small confrontations," said Bray, who reported that some officers had been striking the demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from evicting or applying "laws published after the occupation began or from prohibiting demonstrators from re-entering the park with stores or other properties they used previously".
Mayor Bloomberg pointed out to the press that, due to this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and protesters, whom he warned, however, that local laws did not allow them to re-install with campaigns and sleeping bags.
The director personally defended the detachment carried out in the morning of the Zucotti Square, an operation in which approximately 200 arrests took place and which was decided because the protesters were "violing the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it was becoming "in a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate laws and, in some cases, to harm others", as "some business had received threats" and the neighbors feared "for their quality of life".
"The release of this morning was shocking and shows that the Bloomberg fund is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of US workers," added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "infringing respect for freedom of expression".
The leaders of "Ocupa Wall Street" also indicated that they intend to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community and trade unions, to commemorate the two months during the protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special television navigation
Together with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, it will appear on the television program "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in Home Improvement, assisted by Baywatch, connected by Playboy, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Canadian TV Christmas.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, together with the "croner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear in the television program "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st, giving life to a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide Internet distribution of a pornographic home video in which he appeared together with his then husband, the battery of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed as the Virgin Mary supporting in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comicist of Indian origin who recently acted as a presenter in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special native of CTV has with the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in late March in Buenos Aires, and who is not strange about the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian "Zorra" during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of falls that started in March
Since the last month of March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still eluding by the devastating earthquake that has taken place in a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe the country has ever experienced since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo have numbered material losses of $30 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have decreased.
After three consecutive trims of falls, the data of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to pass, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous trimester and by 6 per cent at an annual rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the reposition of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas isolated by the sixth and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared with the fall of 0.9 per cent in capital expenditure from January to March, the first setback after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real revulsion of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that calls for the use of crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructures, to serve as the lack of growth from scratch.
Japan has particularly woken up thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, pushed by increased expenditure on vehicles, travels and leisure activities.
The jen's token
Tokyo has been ordered to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refugees" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro area and the storm forecasts of the United States, a privilege that weighs as a drop in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic fluctuation line is determined by the health of the major technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, found their weak results between July and September to quote the yen.
While markets continue to sit in the peripheral countries of the EU, the government of Yoshihiko Noda is not down guard.
"There must be attention to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday's Secretary of State of Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
And, in fact, perspectives are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) required that the majority of the member countries present in September more subtle signs of economic slowdown.
The indicator that anticipates the world economy's inflation points pointed out that the main powers are slowing down.
Since it dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 August.
The euro area, including the euro area, was below the average, which is at level 100, when eight tenths to 99.13 points are precipitated.
Athens again feeds the doubts
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With the peripheral risk premiums fired and the uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to sink into the maze leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek Transitional Government is more imposed on Brussels's demands than a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days agreed in his appointment might be short to implement them, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the scheduled date on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit," Papadimos said when opening yesterday a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the Samaras message does not clear the doubts about its position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have committed nothing else."
The conservative leader was a further step towards the EU and the IMF, the agencies that need to unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently needed, and he made it clear that he would not give a good view of any letter of commitment to the adjustments.
But the European Commission, which is still blinded by the impact of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as early as possible".
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that Troika inspectors will return to Athens " very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, although there is also no final date.
The Greek mademaja still has thread for mouse.
Sofia's Lady: "They're instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "prepondant" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a leading position at the global level in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Lady Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor of the plant in connection with this instrument of cooperation, whose " essence" pointed out that it is a "an instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated the V World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "an absolute necessity" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals with a horizon 2015, and, "very especially, in what it aims to reduce half the volume of people living with income below a daily dollar, with which the "poor threshold" is set."
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Mrs. Sofia, who hoped that initiatives and contributions from the Summit, which will be extended until Thursday, "guarante the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
They are "many the achievements achieved" and "many the challenges we face".
The Microcredit Summit is set not only as a forum for discussion, but also as a platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that it is hoped that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that hundreds of millions of these households will leave the poverty threshold in which they are added.
The impulse in the conception of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated years ago in pioneer form" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Mrs. Sofia as a "act of justice and due recognition".
And it is he who described the father of this tool as a "beautiful idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Costa de Marfil in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose link to this project was worth the qualification of the "family head" collected in Valladolid by the "poor baker".
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for all democratic states.
In this regard, I stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to economic prosperity, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered microcredit as "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work on solidarity criteria and not let it be a victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For his part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation Soraya Rodríguez praised "the success" of giving "trust" to people "excluding everyone who closes the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens their contaminated doors of the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democrat Union (CDU), Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democrat Party.
The future of Europe had not initially been included in the agenda, but the issue was imposed in autumn, in particular in order to satisfy the militants who believe that the government's policy is currently too strict with the Greeks and could be in a future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Management Board, was adopted unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes that were won, with his interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Minister of Finance's Europhil, clears out any doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summarized in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is a peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way to Europe."
This could be reflected in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon in order to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe".
In any case, that is one of the motions adopted by the Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that the twenty-six will quickly reach an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball's on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by a overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the European Central Bank Directive on the basis of the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen the weight of Germany.
He is anxious to calm the spirits within his party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But he has also not tried to win his congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty that are willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe deals with the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for the past.
Remembering that two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The impact of fraud on the sick
After the subsidies, the UMP and the Government have committed an offensive against the disease reduction.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Burdeos on Tuesday, 15 November, to visit a box responsible for family subsidies and give a talk on the subject, which has been on the subject since 2007, of combating social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such offensive, which part of the will to save strictly, but still recalls an axis of the presidential right-wing campaign, most want to focus on disease reduction.
First of all, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth-day deficit on private sector workers before being able to take the low.
Finally, unless there is a specific business agreement, a worker who falls sick would lose four days of salary, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose a day of non-remuneration on staff in the event of low employment (to date, there is no shortage, compared to the three days applied in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, most of them are also putting on the table the subject of fraud, this time oriented towards abuses of the labour market.
"The controls are going to increase considerably, and if someone is found to commit a fraud, he must refund the quantities," Xavier Bertrand warned on Sunday 13 November in the RTL.
As in other cases, the effects of the ad seem slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in the field of low-employment.
In fact, there has been a constant follow-up to this issue since 2002 and a number of offensive policies have been launched which have normally produced fruit.
The French are no longer sicker than in the rest of Europe.
Let us pay attention, first, to the national figures.
According to the French Institute for Social Security (CNAM), more than €237 million was paid in 2006 for low-employment benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in the Health Economy, low-income subsidies accounted for 5 per cent of health expenditure in 2008 and amounted to EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% correspond to maternity and occupational accidents, while 54% are related to disease, which amounts to EUR 6,200 million.
Consequently, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 working days, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
One medium that undoubtedly conceals deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the professional management Sirio Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day off due to illness.
Another study, in this case, of the Disease Insurance case, indicates that in 2010 37% of the disease reduction was less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are not more likely than in other areas to get low by disease.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two NRS researchers indicated that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence of work (both for health and other reasons) was between 10 per cent and 11 per cent in France, compared with 20 per cent and 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or between 16 per cent and 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
In the light of the above, it is not particularly significant that fraud in the disease-basis is compared to undeclared work.
The fraud has a very limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation, since 2002, has led to the systematic control of disease reductions of more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM verified, in 13% of the 285,000 conducted, that short-term losses were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of reductions of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of the cases were considered to be " adequately adapted or unjustified; a figure that, with a total of 1.2 million as a result, amounts to 132.000.
A total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are therefore reached among a number of millions of workers who have taken a low rate of disease.
There is no doubt a significant figure in comparison, for example, with work in black.
According to the MPM Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenues of between EUR 9,000 and EUR 15 billion per year, that is, more than the total cost of low subsidies and, no doubt, considerably more than fraud in this last area.
Papadémos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to address its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos told Parliament on Monday 14 November; he added that the hundred days that have been granted to his union government would not be enough to achieve that goal.
"To make efforts to recover the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budgetary adjustment," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public speech during the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of decisions taken during the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as "is at stake" the country's stay in the euro area added.
As a result, Papadémos has foreseen that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to around 9%" of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right-wing group, showed on Monday his support for the measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not commit itself to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with the Members of his party "New Democracy".
He noted that he agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, as well as combating the drop, but against any policy that prevented economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the loan of EUR 8 billion needed without a written guarantee of the support of all the parties to the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything due to external pressure.
A committee of experts states that euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live denying death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In the field of palliative care, the Committee claims that Governments, health care institutions and doctors work together to ensure better palliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by denying death.
In fact, only 9 per cent of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make provision for that.
It is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included the participation of six experts in various areas, including ethics, law and medical.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Penal Code so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient makes such an option and has been considered competent to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada holds its tenth seat, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid of dealing with the subject of death".
With or without medication, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And although most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
In total, the highest rate in this respect is recorded in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that did not coincide with the position of the federal Government, which had already stated that he did not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or suicide assisted with persons who are not competent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, claimed yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excessive reports in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"In Canada euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada, assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians, Euthanasia-friendly
We recall that 85 per cent of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia, since they believe it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66 per cent believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not imply that the life of the elderly or the disabled is of less value.
With regard to persons who have committed assisted suicide, 41 per cent of the respondents believe that a process should not be initiated against them.
With regard to the maintenance or interruption of a patient's health care, the situation is not so clear, as reported by the authors of the report.
Moreover, among its recommendations, it is suggested that the Penal Code indicates that withdrawal of health care, if legally rejected, is not a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect the fact that a patient rejects assistance at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
In the field of palliative care, the Committee claims that Governments, health care institutions and doctors work together to ensure better palliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in the health institutions of Canada, the Committee requests that, except for the purpose of reducing physical pain, be considered euthanasia and subject to the same procedures.
Other experts show reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deshamps, a specialist in health law, has "extremely" qualified the position of experts signing the report, inter alia, because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to terminal disease.
"This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and is over 18 can ask for help to commit suicide," says Deshamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deshamps also stressed that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations."
The Health Law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed his "strong opposition" with regard to the conclusions of the report, which he called "a manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, particularly places the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President El Asad to abandon power
Damascus reports a plot
Syria is increasingly isolated
The supporters of Bachar El Asad appeared yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure on Syria of Bachar El Asad, which, with Russia's support, resists and denounces the existence of a "complaint" against the country, intensified.
Two days after Syria's suspension by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, have been manifested in favour of the abandonment of power by President Asad.
King Abdalá II of Jordan was yesterday's first Arab leader who asked President Bachar El Asad to "stop power" in Syria, where a quarter of civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
"If Bachar is really concerned about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighboring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, has regretted that the mediation efforts he has been making since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," said Syria, a neighboring country in which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough stance.
For their part, following the decisions of the Arab League and of the European Union, the United States has concluded that "the consensus against Asad and the actions of the Syrian regime" has been strengthened.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly tougher tone" with regard to repression in Syria, says Mark Toner, spokesperson for the Department of State.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians have already lost their lives and at least 19 members of the regime's forces in the Deraa region in southern Syria, as announced by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died "on bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in Homs' city, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid Al Mualem, considers the country to be "forward to the end of the crisis".
In addition, he has reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its functions, which in his opinion constitutes a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not flake," he added, guaranteeing that "the plots made against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the military media and observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, has also expressed his support for the dispatch of United Nations observers to help protect civilians against the repression of the regime, which, in his opinion, is included in the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League tomorrow in Rabat is expected to be held to develop the implementation of the exit plan of the crisis adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities that are in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detainees.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, judged yesterday as "inaccurate" the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the plan for the end of the crisis, although it did not support the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time for Italian markets and sacrifices
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to train their equipment and launch a programme that will include "sacrifices" intended to recover the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner debated yesterday with the political parties and today he met with the trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted office, composed of external technocrats in Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad programme with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President of the appointed Council.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he hoped that Mario Monti would request a vote of confidence before Friday to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr Monti's presentation of a limited list, undoubtedly a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and the bonders yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a government and prepare its programme, he stressed, adding that it is "sure that markets will be patient and understand it".
Its appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but then the concern was imposed, particularly after an unforeseen fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team primarily composed of technocrats, even if he has pointed out that he would like to include "politicals".
The new Government should operate until 2013, the date of the next legislation, it considers.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will receive Parliament's vote of confidence before Friday.
Monti has committed himself to working when it is in charge, taking into account the urgency and the objective of Italy 'recovery its protagonist' in Europe.
A spokesperson for Commissioner Olli Rehn has stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not vary."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for new strict measures.
The Italian "head of the leaders" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on the mats, also insisted on the need to drive the economy, "as a country that does not grow cannot meet the deficit requirements".
Monti, famous for his competency and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), is an "exchange of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", according to editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place some EUR 20 billion in state obligations before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, according to an American NGO specialized in atomic risk on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by the United Nations agency.
IAEA demonstrated its "severe concern" over a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme last week.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since 1960, at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk, Ural, and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamantes" in Kiev.
His company's economic problems would have led him to contact the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine in 1995.
Subsequently, it is believed that it cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, according to a Member State to the Agency, worked during most of his career in this technology in the military programme of his country of origin.
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50% between 2009 and 2010, while the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or only slightly, according to statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. it has increased by 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews and a total increase of 14 per cent in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% is due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, as indicated by the FBI.
"After a 2009 decline, it is worrying that these crimes and crimes have again increased," the Human Rights First human rights organization stressed, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long been pointing out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds one head of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. Government can and should strive to put an end to these abuses," he added, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to the race, the color of the skin, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Microblogging Twitter site changed Monday's presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, causing their service to appear a little more than Facebook.
A new "activity" and another "name" tab allow you to follow more legibly and directly the activity of other "Twittos", that is, those internet users whose messages ("tweets") follow you online or follow you.
This allows you to know whether they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they prefer some message, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tried "with a small percentage of users in August" before broadcasting it to the rest of the network on Monday, as AFP has indicated Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive functioning, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to send a message from another person, followfriday to recommend following another user) making the happiness of the initiators, opens up a wider audience with a more comparable handling of the major public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users have debated "tweets" hit with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, it's invasive and looks too much on Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity function will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter stream," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a "gold" budget in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Socialist/Democratic Coalition, which is in power in Austria, has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a budget "gold" to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid possible deterioration of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reaches 74.6%, a much higher figure than the 60% limit set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly less than the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced at a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay EUR 3 billion more in interest every year," said the Democratic Vice-Chairman of Foreign Affairs Michael Spindeleger.
Austria thus responded to a request from the Brussels Summit to the eurozone member countries of the last 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government requested the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law with equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is closer to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt that kind of "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the federal State's structural public deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP annually, while the regional States, as well as the municipalities, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 2020/2021 on the basis of the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A Strong Yen
Threatened node with a new intervention from the exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the trade mark if the yen continued to increase.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we prove that excessive volatility occurs" in the type of change of the yen, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen went up to a level close to the historical peaks that led to the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massively full dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been slowly mounting since then, driven by the purchases of investors that consider it a "refuge value" in these times uncertain of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar back to be quoted on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has come down below the 105 yen symbol bar, reaching some levels close to the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar was estimated at around 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, as it enshrines the products Made in Japan and reduces the value of foreign revenues obtained by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is fighting for reconstruction" after the 6th and 11th March tsunami, which devastated the Tohoku region (northest), highlighted Noda, who is afraid that the anchoring of the single root cut the weak recovery.
The third global economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (a 1.5 per cent relative to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of homes affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect Japan's "economic bases".
The Minister of Finance Jun Azumi asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting on Tuesday of its Monetary Policy Council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution's Deputy Governor Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", implying that no more monetary flexibility should be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the emission institute increased its purchases of Treasury Letters by five billion (EUR 47 billion) and led to the 55 billion (EUR 519 billion) threshold of funds dedicated to the acquisition of various financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
the types grow, the bags melt
The risk of contamination of the debt crisis continues to be detrimental to European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the types of weaker countries continue to increase.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, European stockpiles sink a little further into the negative area on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 loses 1.4% and is located at 3,064 points.
Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
"In view of the new tensions with regard to the performance of the loans of the euro area States most affected, the world's stock markets continue to be part of their recent profits."
"The investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contamination," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional runner in IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a drop of 0.7%, renewing the market stakeholders' concerns about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed view in Europe and exchanges will continue to take place in a limited range of variations, so that investors will not have evidence that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager in Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
Reappearing concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 hours, the European currency was worth $1.3570, a drop of 0.4 per cent.
According to the corridors, it has lost value after the Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, which met at Congress on Monday, adopts a motion which, in particular, provides for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types surpass 6% with growth
The credit types of Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of Italian obligations at 10 years of age reached 6.85 per cent, while Spanish titles at the same time offered 6.2 per cent.
These tensions in relation to the types of interest of the countries in the south, although also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has requested time for the markets to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of being weighed down by its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is at the market point, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference in types ("spread") between 10-year-old obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new maximum historical level.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
From a statistical point of view, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable figure than the projected 0.3%, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised the number of the second quarter down, with a reduction of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really cares about economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded a growth of 0.5 per cent in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are foreseen at 11 a.m. after the European Commission has warned about the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must be worth more than the dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be dealt with taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an election meeting be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Now that we are 7. billion people on the planet, demographic developments will entail the duplication of electrical demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world ' s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, there will have to be an increasing shortage of fossil resources to continue producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Germany therefore remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
This is not the case either of Belgium, which submits itself to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or of Switzerland, which only aims to build last-generation centres.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, by quoting some examples, continue to be determined with their projects.
The United States, on the other hand, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, retaking the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality goes against such speech.
Berlin's election will entail an increase in the price of electricity, a greater energy dependency due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular Russia, to increase CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noted.
You should think about Denmark's case.
Europe's wind campaign, of which 30% of its electricity, is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours are paying an electricity bill of 40% higher than that of the French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would result in a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would remain realistic to the wonderful declarations on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not at first object to that type of energy, as the surveys show.
We remember that our country's energy policy has lost to building an industrial sector with 125,000 jobs and 41,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it covers a galaxy of specialized SMEs in international markets and which can create non-replaceable jobs.
If France had decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would have incurred the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of EUR 6 billion annually in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electricist would charge an EPR designed to operate for 60 years, when the collapse of its manufacturer is expected?
In order to solve the equation of nuclear energy, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, as there is no diabolical source.
The development by Areva of low-carbon and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the maximum level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing power plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In the mid-century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it did not lead to consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and to unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these progress and cooperation between the security authorities and French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is studied by all the electrical actors who want to build a power plant, the interruption of their construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave them free to assume leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partial manoeuvres dominate such an important debate for our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from a number of points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the figures policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "the country of human rights" in France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students, which has skipped the holders, with the Minister of Interior (see the Liberian newspaper of 23 May) saying in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or comrades".
However, economic analysis rarely takes place.
The question is that, on this subject, there is a lot of consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation by stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with about two million migrant workers", while on the left, the tone fixed Michel Rocard explaining that France "can't handle all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish fountains.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity with which they act with regard to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande is limited to include banals, indicating that the code-development will enable "migration problem" to be solved.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, maybe it's cost-effective selectively, but economically it's very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron pointed out in a recent work summarizing the most recent knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Limitation of immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
Fears of the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, particularly those who are not qualified, by pressing for their wages to be reduced.
But experience shows that immigrants are actually more complementary than national workers and are mainly engaged in jobs in sectors with no employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national and most skilled workers in dynamic sectors where training does not meet staff demand.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country that lacks anesthetists, complementarity between national and immigrant leads to a positive impact on the arrival of the latter on the salaries and employment of the national.
Taking into account the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1 per cent of the migration flows would result in a rise in real long-term wages of between 0.6 and 0.9 per cent.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel prizes and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who is 30 years old will make a net (less cost) contribution of EUR 150,000 to the public average budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term of office, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growth points he lacked "with his teeth".
These teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it just needs to think about a European democracy
Democracy is a precious but fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember that, although it was invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, during the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also in Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the Coronals in Greece.
Some may have believed that, in order for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and the most direct way possible.
We know, from Napoleon, "the Little One," which was a thought.
The universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough for itself and can even become an "oppressive instrument", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and a control of powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we live in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinodity of the true-false Greek referendum in this regard had a dual revealing effect: it showed the need for a strong return of the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
You have to think about this ambivalentity to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now moved and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer progressing in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to the needs and in an irregular manner.
A white signature to the absolute European monarch or an empty nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to strike effective, but a common exercise, full law, quiet and continuous, from options and democracy, this time on a European scale.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we did not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that adheres to the orders of markets and qualification agencies, the one that suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty recovers the team from the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce their debt burden, get rid of the markets and prepare their future through investment.
The end of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
After a long struggle against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, the whole world is now calling for European economic governance.
That's the way it is.
But thinking about it without greater political and democratic integration, and without living as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new dead point.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
In order to build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The revolution motivated by interests would not be enough.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
Only a more democratic Europe can be achieved at the political level, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us make Europeans.
Cards with "don't touch" chips are generalized
The world hall of chip cards starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic environment.
In fact, 2011 should end up with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessors cards (bank cards, SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6. billion units, according to Eurosmart's firm calculations.
The most powerful segment is that of wireless technology, which allows you to subscribe to common transport or purchases simply by approaching the card to a reader.
This year 460 million cards will be sold worldwide with no contact chip, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (preventing 580 million units) and represent about 10% of the world market for chips (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has spent a long time on the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the non-contact payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its initials are more modest: 400,000 visa cards are being used without contact.
But the big surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million pass cards this year without contact.
To make the top move, however, banks need to make it available to their customers.
"There are two major French establishments that have been committed to systematically spreading in the future, among their customers, bank cards with no contact system," said Gérard Nebouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test the payment by mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the middle of the future: the mobile phone.
There are currently few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, essential for carrying out the transactions.
"They're praying."
"But I should finally experience a real increase in the coming year."
"We predict that between 80 and 120 million units will be sold worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the front.
The Agricultural Credit Bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and June in Caen.
The iPhones of about 200 customers and collaborators will be matched with a fund that allows the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society also stated yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile phone.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is increasing
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Magreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which has been suspected for a long time, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Algeria "has the certainty".
"The way in which both organizations operate and the intelligence services reports show that they are cooperating," he explained, without providing more details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French in Niger last January would have resumed the passageways.
Rapped in a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the following day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the interventions, French and Nigerian researchers discovered several phone chips belonging to terrorists.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,
The study of the calls made indicates a number of interlocutors based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially captured the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, in Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must no doubt wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect has enjoyed financial and intellectual external support and is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" have been increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or in its operating modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex camikazes or explosive devices and the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, beginning with Washington, has since been pressuring Abuya to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities take time considering the group as a community of illuminators not worthy of interest.
A Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in hausa, "Western education is a sin"), encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It is politicized and demanded strict respect for the Sharia, while its militants are engaged in the fight against the evil central government.
The latter focus primarily on churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's militants were particularly active and the attacks on the commissioners increased.
Abuya's reaction was, as it usually happens, generalized.
The army attacked the city and recorded 800 deaths.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, received death in prison.
Since then, the sect has been radicalized and abandoning its northern branches.
The past Christmas claims an attack that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular the police-protected headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of which.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters became its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would cover from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, concerns all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppe warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information".
The world according to the Republican candidates to the Presidency
With regard to China, Iran and with the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry, they compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
An America weakened by the crisis, can you manage a complex world with simple ideas or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican candidates for presidents, voters might think so.
Since a few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more strutious statements and foreign policy attacks, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
The slogans are often unfounded about China, Iran, helping Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the race for the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for the manipulation of their currency", a key theme in an America exasperated by the migration of the entire sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if that involves the explosion of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama Ambassador to China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, is almost overwhelmed by an attitude that "absolutes" emotions.
He asked for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current Obama position).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the probes, remains inaudible.
Reagan style
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if the sanctions fail to interrupt its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he fanfarrone.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
It also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing with its obligations in relation to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-classed candidate, shows for his part a shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capabilities", apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had a military atom since 1964.
The Governor-led Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. army in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also preceded by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was a fan and that he had to blow up the gun in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty exit of Iraq's "boys" and its bickerings in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks aren't simple.
The population is more positive about Obama's national security balance, which ended with Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been mistrustful of military interventions that generate a deepening.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild economically America to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being fairer.
The North Stream, new entrance door of Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream pipeline, which directly communicates Western Europe with Russia passing through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must provide gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with a great pump.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the Baltic coasts, between orchestra music and a delicate buffet, at the opening of the North Stream, the new pipeline that communicates directly under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have turned together the valve wheel that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western Europe network.
With this new pipeline, it will reach 27.5 million cubic metres of additional Russian gas to Western Europe each year through a first 1224 km pipeline that communicate the San Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline should be completed by the end of 2012 which will provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, i.e. enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, the possibility of constructing a third tube is already discussed on the same route.
For Gazprom, the time-concluding of this huge work presents the air of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had firmly opposed the project.
In fact, the North Stream will allow direct supply of gas to Germany, avoiding land transit by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
These two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening it to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare North Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
I mean, whether the topic is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe's energy, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has only known for five years to triumph over its vision of a direct partnership between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and increasingly limited reserves.
"This pipeline is a component of our association with Russia, a new artery that organically unites us," said François Fillon during the launch of the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the major gas sector contracts are both political and economic.
All of this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the Gazprom directors, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of steel covered with concrete to protect it from the anchors of the ships.
It is located at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mine fields dating from World War II.
"It was necessary to withdraw or destroy a hundred of them by caution," says Jens Müller, spokesperson for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to extend measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not broken all over its length: not by valves, not by maintenance stations.
A control platform was envisaged in Sweden's waters, but the project's managers gave up the project to see that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to establish itself permanently at sea in front of their backs.
"In case we have, we will interrupt the gas passage in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of escape, gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that a flight will take place, since it has been envisaged that, according to the forecasts, they will have a flight every 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the pipeline is guaranteed by a submarine robot, drawn by a ship, carrying out external inspections, as well as by a device running through the interior of the pipeline.
With the shape of a pure, it enters the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three metres per second, it provides accurate data on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without the need for any type of repair.
Gas circulation is guaranteed by pressure only.
At first it's 200 bars and 100 bars.
Five companies have joined their forces to be able to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
To her, Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as Dutch Gasunie and French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a common company, called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and exploiting the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented this company, for a renewable period of twenty-five years, the total capacity of gas transport.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline has been completed by 30% with the contribution of shareholders and by 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should be EUR 7,400 million for the two pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom assumes the risk of spending on its own.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pines.
Some valves, with a height of 4.5 meters, form the gas output door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas at arrival, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
The total capacity will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people the taste for writing.
It has an adventure air, writing hours in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine book is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white sheets, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine books with the current aspect were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Mode, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a book of design notes, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant of the company, was responsible for launching the new product.
The bookcase is inspired by an old production technique, the skin mole (top leather), which refers to a cotton cotton that was used, inter alia, to cover the banquets.
This type of book was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the present taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the avant-garde artists until the 20th century", says Maria Sebregondi, who since then has become responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And he made it.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Far away has been the confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, since the notebook attracts both business men and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, their users are cosmopolitans, of open spirit and worship.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers at its start, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks in libraries, from the Fnac to the small shops in the center of the cities, and has been able to impose its identity.
"We have adapted ourselves to the times and the need to write, despite the increase in e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes from hand to hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own box.
In August, he also launched a box with Leopard tapas, on account of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has managed to diversify its products: bags, schedules, handicrafts, computer funds... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in autumn 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are seeking employment.
The XV Week for the employment of the disabled begins today.
Despite a resolved public policy, applied since 2005, the unemployment rate among persons with disabilities doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Disappointment?
"No," said Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made 15 years ago is considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there's still a lot to be done."
It should be noted that the unemployed continue to face numerous obstacles to accessing employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 years old (a 17% average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not completed the bachelor's degree and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread among them: 53 per cent for the disabled, compared to 38 per cent on average.
In other words, there are numerous issues that make it particularly difficult to return to the working world and that "constitute the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
Moreover, there are those who are not mentioned; the mind of people progresses, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Enterprise Association for the City pointed out that the directors surveyed have "a level of knowledge about low disabilities", with an "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physical or intellectual weaknesses".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, which was set out in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, which date from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
"Now we reach around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not respect this law.
The test: the number of establishment "subject to this contribution" as well as the amounts disbursed has decreased between 2007 and 2011, ranging from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Law, which increased contributions, has generated great pressure for businesses," says Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a true awareness, especially among the major groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of the companies with between 20 and 49 workers have employees with disabilities in their schedule, compared to 82 per cent of the companies with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A Joy"
In the face of the Blues on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly party generates.
We will not dare to say that there was convivity among them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the way to the auditorium of Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after the gesture of resentment against Turkey, the Belgian electorate has no more than praise for him.
"I am very happy for Eden, for his progress and for his Belgian status."
"I want to move forward," Lille's front answered.
As for the contrast between their presentations on their team and selection, "is a set", it has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all year round, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to sit down."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "bright."
Don't forget about the "placer."
He has been encouraging the Blues since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been his fan," he says.
That will certainly strengthen the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because you will face " Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) " " , remember.
"We just faced a little bit ago.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
Leekens has simply made reference to the "glory" for his part.
"Hungry" for arguing "a game of gala."
"Hand" also for checking, as "neighbor", that France "wanted to be a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's traumatism.
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job," he said excitedly.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Blues to... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We're building something; the players are ambitious, they're hungry.
"You can see it in the next games." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows great confidence
Porto de Paulo Bento faces a great optimism at the return party against Bosnia (22h00), to be held in Lisbon on Tuesday.
In the party, both teams lacked realism.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we'll be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt about it; the Select, which has been running since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Eurocopa.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there's a party to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Taking into account the go-to (0-0) party, Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but could not mark the valuable goal that would have given him peace.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, as we haven't marked out of the house."
But at home, at the bright Lisbon Light Stadium, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before a public who should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is evident that the party is "very equal," said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope the party is very equal, but we are fully convinced that we can take the lead," said 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in the Eurocopa 2012," said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
Friday's jam in Bosnia forces Portuguese to mark and win.
The Bosni could get them an empate, although they also need to mark.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, as we haven't marked out of the house," says Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and that has players with a great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "don't leave them time to think".
A good idea, whenever, this time, be realistic.
