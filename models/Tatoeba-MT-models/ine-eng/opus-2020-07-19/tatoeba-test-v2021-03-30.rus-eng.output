I can't explain it to you.
He's afraid of a dog.
There was a lot of girls at the party.

What does he hate me for?
Stop scaring him.
He knows her from high school.
Tom made it look like nothing happened.
I promised myself I'd quit smoking.
Stay here with them.
Avariya didn't deserve his life.
He cut off the bottle.
We're home.
You haven't returned those books yet?
I met him at the club.
I didn't agree.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you don't get me back.
What are you so secretive about?
You're just running away from life's problems.
Stay out of the snow.
When did you see her?
I've been waiting for you for three hours.
I missed the exam.
Eat while it's hot.
So we had to spend three hours.
What are you offering me?
Tom thinks Maria's an idiot.
I said wait for me.
I couldn't answer all the questions.
I didn't know you'd come too.
Last week, I hit Tom in Boston.
Tom's beautiful.
Tom didn't know that Mary loved to prepare.
I said 'cause you're busy.
Tom was surprised to see Mary in Boston.
You want the anecdotes?
I wanted to do more.

Are you sure you know what that means?
I can't just ignore him.
She's riding to school on a bicycle.
I'll pay now!
Would you like to sit down for a roll?

Help the window.
Don't think I didn't try.
You stay here.

Tom went to the park alone.
You're a teacher, aren't you?
I won't try to convince you.
I knew Tom wouldn't lose.
Tom told Mary he wanted to drink.

Tom won't sell his house.
I didn't want to hurt Tom.
I'll teach you.

Let me tell you why it happened?
I'll give you something.
Why should Tom apologize?
The results were shocking.
This room is empty.
Tom sent Mary a telegram.
Can you believe that?
We spent the night in the open sky.
Don't shut the door.
When are you free?
Didn't you have to do that on October 20th?
I have to go to work now.
Who is this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it start?
Circumcision is one of five feelings.
What's wrong with you?
They're afraid of him.
Tom at work.
Tom's hiding something from us.
He didn't even touch him.
Have you made a name for a newborn yet?
I want you to help me with my homework.
I'm not a specialist.
I got cold from him.
I like Brazil, but I'm still going to Ukraine.
I made you breakfast.
I didn't think you'd let me do that.
I see Tom almost every day after school.
The grave will be healed.
Soup's so hot it's impossible.
Why is she so popular?
They declared their innocence.
Where are you so badly hurt?
I don't think they're friends.

I thought Tom and Mary were friends.
I was expecting good news from them.
Distilled water is tasteless.
Father is now in the garden.

I used to dream of being a millionaire.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Tom's planning to break up with his girlfriend.
Where are you going tonight?
Tom closed the door in his bedroom.
I've known Tom for a few months.
You're desperate!
Tom plays very well on the script.
No one's accusing you.
Next year, Crolik.
Tom almost always takes the bath before dinner.
I can take you home.
What did you learn?
Please write down what I say.
Now I'm adding the last lines.
I can't forget Tom.
I don't have a book.
Tennis is the only kind of sport Tom has in his possession.
Come to the skeleton.
Let me help you.

Remember, I love you.
He's a killer, as they say.

I'm not gonna be like that anymore.
I go shopping every morning.
The baby's pushing.

You're taking your eyes off.
Tom was tall for his age.
Did you notice what Mary had in her mind?
You're gonna be late for school again.
What's your favorite movie guy?
That's why I didn't have to ask twice.
You need to go to Boston.
I was moved with joy.
She's rich, young and beautiful.
Do you love your country?
I rarely see you and Tom.
I'm pretty tall.
From a practical point of view, there are many shortcomings.
This is the house I live in.
I'm going to school with him.
It seems to you that you disagree.
Tom didn't kill Mary.
I don't know what I mean.

Tom gave the will of anger.
The missing boy was identified by his clothes.
I've got good reflexes.
Tell me what it looked like.
She'll probably refuse to follow his advice because she doesn't like him.
Did you write it?
I know you're working on them.
I hope I can help you.
Does your parents know about this?
The officer put a white skater on the table.
That day I stayed home because it was raining.
Is there a pharmacy around here?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why is Tom looking at me like that?
I called the police and told them my car was stolen.
We can discuss this later.
That helps a little.
The bones in ancient Egypt were sacred animals.
Can I speak in public?
I work for an oil company.

Take another oven.
I want to sleep!

Tom in the park.
I didn't think you'd be here today.
"Who are you by nationality?" "Argentinians."
Why are you sad?
I can do a lot better than you.
Don't forget!
I really think so.
The sun's broken.
Tom brought his room in order.
Did you file a complaint?
I don't like Tom very much.
So we're going to have to change our plans.
Someone bit him.
Do you want to know anything else?
Tom said he wanted to see us before he left.
But I don't have the money.
How's your new salary, Mary?
There was fear on his face.
If you don't tell her, I will.
Can you trust the secret?
My mother died in an accident.
London is the capital of England.
Her mother was a singer.
Should we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
It's your fault.
Tom told everyone he was adopted.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Take her somewhere.
I was just there when it happened.
Her origin is unknown.
Enjoy it.
Tom wakes up from a deep sleep.
You're big.
Where did you see him?
I don't know why you want me to do it.
I hope I see him Monday.
Are you sure you want to sell your father's guitar?
There's no girl on the Internet.
They'll find you.
I'm trying to figure out why this happened.
We'll send them an opening.
If you don't want to answer, you don't have to.
Look to the left and to the right before crossing the road.

We've heard those promises before.
What did you and Tom do after dinner?
I'm very unhappy.
As is often the case, Mike is late for the meeting today.
Tom told me that Mary had a new boyfriend.
We're not gonna let that happen.
These fools violated the law prohibiting the law.
It's not done yet.
John spoke so loud that I heard him on the second floor.
Tom checked his vision.
I didn't give it to him.
It's weird.
I know you're rich.
Bill delayed a hundred dollars on his way.
He served in the fleet.
Who taught you to dance?
Tom's got his nose kicked off.
I wouldn't be surprised.
Seriously, I'm not.
You knew them better than I did.
None of us want this to happen.
How much more wine to buy?
I won't waltz.
He sat in the car and left.
So tell me about everything that happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.
All models are wrong, but some are useful.
I don't have time to do homework.
It's a big step forward.
Pray for me, Tom.
We still don't know the side effects of this medicine.
Tom's got a toothache for three days.
You seem to know everyone here.
Hope dies last.
That's the girl who came here yesterday.
I'll give you a new one.
You said it was yours.
Where did he buy those boots?
Don't make me do it.
Why are you laughing?
Tom usually travels to work on the bus.
Fadel went to school.
I've been working with Tom before.
Tom and I are partners on the team.
Leave him alone!
My heart beats more every time I see her.
Do I think so?
Everyone except Tom, the hats.
She gives him everything he asks.
Is that sold?
I'm getting worse.
Do you have that much bigger?
It's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
That only exacerbates the problem.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of a washbasin in the bathroom.
I called the door.
Tell him I'm sick.
They're gone.
Can you take your car for a while?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jessie standing there.
They're very close.
You're wet.
There's a little sugar in the package.
I did it when I was a kid.
Something really good happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't get involved in other things.
Who's in the blue football?
Tom's got an American accent.
I don't have the money to buy a word.
Why are you so surprised?
It's useful to see.
I want you to tell me everything.
She looks good for her age.
If I knew her address, I'd write her a letter.
She kept herself married.
We need to talk to them.
I'd like to talk to you.
Tom took care of it.
It's the third.
The lion is strong.
I needed to make sure he was coming here.
She said she didn't know the rules.
Education is one of the most important aspects of life.
The boy fixed the cap.
Maybe we're having a walk?
He's capable of math.
I'm glad you told me about her.
He's afraid of the basket.
I hear you're playing a good gang.
Did you read them?
I said 'cause I won't help him.
Tom's sorry he left Boston.
I don't like this store.
Tom speaks more French than he does.
I don't remember how much I paid for it.
You're not eating with us?
Tom lives in Australia with his wife and three children.
I could barely sit on a train.
I don't like to argue.
You like science fiction movies?
I'll make her happy.
Just tell him I called.
I don't want to get up.
His home behind the hill.
It was Sunday, and I didn't get up early.
What a lunch!
Mary, are you in a good shape now?
I made a mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom's done 20 shots.
I'm sure you can handle the job.
After Mary gave the encouragement, she poured a bottle of wine through him and took a hard step out of the restaurant, a dead silence ensued.
You're two years younger, Tom.
We've met them.
Tom's gonna be fine tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you'll need a loan.
Tom’s father, who is in prison, never writes that.
It's expensive.
I haven't received any news from him in a hundred years.
I didn't know Tom couldn't swim.
I thought we all had a long time to meet.
Everyone's interested in Japan.
Tom's getting out of his way.
Please, just do everything like me.
Stay there.
I disagree with him.
That's what it's called success.
It was so dark in the room that I had to get through it.
How many aircraft in the U.S. Army?
She's your teacher?
Get back together, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?
Tom knows he doesn't need it anymore.
Tom was in the garden.
Young plants are placed in a green bush.
I own French.
If that sounds too good to be true, it's probably not true.
Leave it where he found it.
Tom had to tell Mary.
Why is everybody looking at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you it would work.
It all seems so strange.
Tom decided to go.
You've taught me a lot.
How long are you sleeping?
Bring in the trash.
Tom apologized to the audience.
Tell Mary I have her keys.
Did you buy some candles?
Canada is a hockey family on ice.
The brain is a very complex organ.
They'd agree.
Your Japanese good.
We're going through a window.
The spiders are disgusting little creatures.
I want to know where it is.
Kiss without lips like a soup without salt.
Did you try to talk to him?
Where are the others locked up?
That's all that happened today.
I saw the car hit a man.
We accepted their invitation.
Tom worked with Mary.
I'm tired of dying.
Do you know what your kids are doing now?
You want her to stay?
He misses her.
Tell me, please, I'm right.
We saw the castle in front of us.
Tom kept stabbing her.
Six goes in front of the family.
Today I went to the grave of my grandfather.
Tom couldn't believe someone was trying to kill him.
Tom didn't dance with Mary.
I saw a man who came from a garbage dump yesterday.
I think Tom lied to me.
She took me under her wing.
Tom and Maria stopped laughing when they noticed John crying.
I have to meet Tom.
Tom lost his thumb.
Did you sign the contract?
I said 'cause he needs to talk to a lawyer.
They're not on that bus again?
Let Tom go home.
I'm not hungry either.
He's got a lot of company.
This area has changed completely.
Tom's anti-Semitic.
What is your strongest side?
Tom doesn't like it when he's pushed.
Interestingly, when Angelica Agurbash sang a song on the words of Necliev, could she imagine that he was going to dance in the president?
There's yogurt in the fridge.
Can you tell us what's going on?
Tom's always being honest.
Famous must be there by two thirty.
Show me Boston on the map.
Tom said he was extremely exhausted.
Tom wasn't in his room?
Why aren't you looking for him?
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
I wouldn't want anything better.
Tom wants a popcorn.
My favorite restaurant burned down.
John's not careful, he's making a lot of mistakes.
Tom took Mary's interview.
Tom is my personal assistant.
Who's this guy?
Keep your children away from the mud.
Let's talk about this tonight.
I have to do it.
They don't know French.
Get out of here!
I knew what Jacksons were doing.
You don't have to apologize to me.
Tom and Mary have one granddaughter and three granddaughters.
He wants peanut butter.
You're so lucky.
Tom's getting a little drunk.
I barely understood him.
He ran away from the receipts.
You can live in a large house, and you don't feel like you are.
I expect Tom to tell me what to do.
I'll see him tonight.
One plus one is two.
Red better.
The universe is endless.
I'm not ready to do this yet.
Thank you for your visit.
What did you mean?
I wanted to spend more time with you.
Can you tell me about Tom?
Can I have Tom for a few words?
Don't sound like that.
When was Tom arrested?
We're going to six.
The olive has become a victim of the lion.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom's a little younger than your daughter.
I did everything I could to save Tom.
Try to get her to help us.
Are you with us?
It's your wish.
Tom's alive.
It may be in the water for ten years, but it won't be a crocodile.
Tom made a point that he doesn't understand that Mary's trying to tell him.
I saw how it happened.
I think there can be no other reason than that.
I'm very happy now.
My apartment was robbed last week.
How do you always get to be so energetic?
Put your signature here.
What an ego!
So you bought it?
The man is as old as he is, and the woman as she is.
Wisdom comes with age.
Remember what you told me?
There's been a lot of snow in the last year.
He tried to cross the river.
Everything seems to be nice.
Tom told Mary to tell her the truth.
You don't want a daughter yet?
I like to dance along the river.
You can come with me.
This word is a great gift for us.
"How long before dinner?" "Five minutes."
Tell her.
Mary spent all her time at work.
Tom sat on his motorcycle and took him.
Have you ever been to Scandinavia?
Can I open my eyes now?
I don't want to play cards.
I want to keep working here.
I live in Latvia.
I've been waiting for him till ten.
Tom usually says the first thing in his head.
Why do you want to leave?
How's it going to be more French until we meet?
It wasn't worth it.
What do you have with the computer?
We were both busy.
I'm fine.
We're not going to release you.
Do you really think Tom can swim?
How are you going to spend so much money?
Mary likes to hang out with bad guys.
It is often said that one language is missing every week in the world.
She has a little advantage.
I thought we talked about it.
How sad my parents would have been if I had suffered a failure.
I feed the basket every morning and every evening.
Hold your tongue, you won't get it.
You must take into account all the consequences before making any changes to the existing code.
I can't bite.
I think you did great.
Last night we had a strong rain.
What did Tom bring?
That's exactly what I was looking for.
Tom noticed that the door was open.
That's when I hurt my granddaughter.
Tell me more about him.
What choice did I have?
You should stay upstairs.
Come back home early, Bill.
She sat on the table and read the magazine.
Since then, it has been prohibited to cry.
If I knew that, I'd tell you.
Here's where he lived.
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to you.
Have my chocolate? Don't even think about it!
Beautiful in white, it looks more like a house.
I had difficulty finding the original quote.
I had no idea you were familiar with her.
What's the point of doing this?
Which dog is yours?
That's why you have to give more time.
You didn't tell me what Tom said in French.
Tom is returning to Boston next week.
Why don't you help me?
I watched a movie in French with English subtitles.
I'll eat.
In my opinion, Tom played well.
He only blames others, and he never does.
You guys can play the gang?
Tom came to Mary and hugged her.
"When are you coming back?" "It depends on the weather."
How many turtles do they live?
How safe is it?
Your message has been received.
It took me three years to complete my house.
I was upset.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
We'll see if we can do that.
Tom didn't want us to attend his party.
I suddenly realized what was going on.
She said she'd be late.
Your parents still live in Germany?
I need her today.
Tom's probably gonna win.
What do you want Santa to bring you?
Why doesn't Tom want to see me?
Where's your spirit of desire for adventure?
What are you mad at me for?
You can leave if you want.
I see you've met.
Something tells me you're right.
It's not my cat.
The captain ordered his men to shoot.
Sit down there.
He hasn't done it yet.
Tom became a father.
Tom's been talked to with my daughter.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
It's hard to be a woman, to think like a man, to act like a lady, to look like a girl and to work like a horse.
Let me talk to her first.
I tried to convince her, but I couldn't.
I thought you were Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
Sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy it.
I've never seen you in a hat before.
Put him on the pole.
I thought you found someone else.
On this road there is always a huge number of vehicles.
You lied to all of us.
I don't think Tom has any brothers or sisters.
He must love you.
It's absurd to pretend that you make me believe that I believe in what you don't believe!
I think that would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I was mistaken.
I appreciate your support.
You think that's possible?
In the end, he's sick.
You think Tom's locked up?
If that's true, she's better than me.
I'll take good care of Tom.
Tom, looks like he didn't recognize you.
I refuse to help.
Can I sit with her?
Leave him alone.
Are you reading anything except the Bible?
Read me the accountant's statement in the boiler.
What does this gentleman do for a living?
Why do you think that's why you like it?
Is that what your parents know?
Is that what they're talking about?
Tom's waiting for you at the conference room.
The main thing in Tatoeb is not to say thoughts above your stomach and lower your knees.
He paid him four dollars.
I had to cancel my trip because of the strike.
I don't know your name.
How many trains are coming to Boston?
What words for this song?
Mary likes to irritate her brother.
The law on my side.
So we had to find where he lived.
Tom was with Mary all morning.
The publication of the article was given on the day of the Professor's birth.
You've got a phone several times while you're in your soul.
She went out for him because of the money.
Not every bird can sing.
I bought him a magazine.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Tom doesn't respect them.
It's just superstition.
Tom must make his own decisions.
Count, please.
Your shoes must always be clean.
You'll have your birthday soon.
Count it down.
I don't like those boots.
Tom had been married to Mary for a long time.
It's just a picture I jumped on the Internet.
I think that's why less than thirty.
Have you had a drink?
No doubt, he is best suited for this work.
You're making my work easier.
Tom said he saw Mary do it.
Tom can't just leave.
I'm loved.
You don't seem to be very busy.
Delline's gone.
You look a lot like me.
You know from those men?
Tom left the room, didn't say a word to anyone.
That probably didn't happen.
Have you finished the chain yet?
Tom and Mary talked for no less than an hour.
I want you to stay with us.
He tried to save her.
If you press this button, the door will open.
How many gals do you need?
I'm back to help you.
Tell me more about them.
Did you hear the last words?
I'd show you how it's done.
I asked Tom to come.
You've got a cake.
Mom taught me not to waste money.
We could walk.
She died yesterday afternoon.
I can't grow our daughter alone.
He took a seat for me.
I wanted to talk about it.
I screamed for help.
Can you explain your answer?
I know it's important to you.
They all knew her.
We'd better stop.
I'm not late anymore.
I'm terribly hungry.
I live pretty close to you.
Tom tends to the horses.
Why is Tom disagreeable with you?
I have to go back to Australia.
Usually people die if they're killed.
They turned Tom off the life insurance device.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
I'm sorry about my French.
What did I do now?
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They won't let me go.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always tell each other.
I've never been satisfied.
Tom's got two of you.
Tom closed the lid.
I'll marry a lawyer.
Another interesting source of energy is heat that can be obtained from radioactive waste.
He's smarter than me.
Why did you say that first?
Your grandmother is a charming lady.
He wouldn't dare do that.
The 12-hour journey has disturbed me.
The baby woke up in the middle of the night.
I said I was tired.
Who's the boss of this company?
Nobody saw us do it.
He came back two days later.
Tom was in the morning.
We need to be home soon.
When did you move to Boston?
I know Tom and Mary are in love.
Eda!
So you helped wash the window?
It's out of my jurisdiction.
That was yesterday.
I'm starting to love myself.
Who wants to be your son when he grows up?
I'm too busy here.
Don't tell me what really happened.
I'm not just gonna give you this.
What are you gonna say?
Did you talk about your hobby?
Get down here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed my friends these openings.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I threw the ball.

I can't give this word to anyone.
Give me that box.
They say his father died in a foreign country.
Take mine.

I'll be late.
Your kids know French?
Tom screamed and ran out of the room.
This soup gives you fish.
There's a lot of girls in the room.
He's talking too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
You didn't know I was teaching French in Boston before?
Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to make time.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among people, spoke horrendously in the eyes of the Jews, the Galileo dialect of Aramaic rather than Hebrew, thus showing the inability of allegations of the existence of a sacred language that is especially close to God in prayer.
Tom's finally changed his mind.
My opinion is slightly different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
That's why they paid three hundred dollars for it.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom will do.
The weather forecast is not wrong.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.
I'll ask Tom to get you something to eat.
I'll go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read this book.
Tom didn't wear a tie.
That's my answer!
I heard him sing in his soul.
You remind me of a young man.
Tonight, Tom's on a trip.
I'm always busy.
I'm playing for the piano a little bit.
I thought you were a vision.
Tom got up fast.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.

It's important.
Have you called Lucy yet?
A good idea came to her head at the last minute.
There's a very cold air in this room.
Why aren't you in the sweatroom today?
The pound is a unit of weight.
I wouldn't talk to him in your place anymore.
Japan needs a lot of papers.
It's very difficult.

Tell her I'm sick.
Tom seems to be very busy.
And I'm so glad to meet you.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
I can't help it.
Is that my book?
Stira is a routine job.
Who else do you have on the list?
So don't let my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going with.
I'd like to know what to tell them.
Tom's kids must miss him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you should talk to them.
He's reading physics in Oxford.
He hid that fact from me.
Is that what you saved me?
He's been horribly snoring in his sleep.
What's your favorite browser?
Tom recognized Mary by the vote.

Someone said something, but I didn't understand.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I've never been worried about them.
Tom was able to reach the hospital on his own.
I was sitting next to Tom.
Your voice is upset.
You've always been so selfish?
I think this medicine will be of great benefit to you.
Tell him to be here by half a third.
It's not God's teaching.
Tom suspected that Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't talk to her.
I'm afraid it'll rain.
Would you like a beer?
Where did you see him?
The poor cat was on the brink of a famine.
I've learned so much from my mistakes that I'm going to do a few more!
My favorite color is blue.
I've made some corrections.
You don't know what you're talking about.

Go to me.

Where do you want to go next exit?
How wonderful is that?
I'm tired.
Tom wasn't wearing Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car's a good sale.
I need to work on these exits.
You can't do this to us.
His words made me sad.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know that's why I had to.
Give her a hello from me.
Was that a lie?
Tom's answer to everyone's shock.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom in return?
It's time for me to go.
Where was your son?
I saw it in the store.
Peace is cruel.
I've got a good dream.
That's why no one cares but themselves.
I'm from Sydney.

I'm happy with what's there.
What did you just come here for?
The post office's a mile away.

Where are our friends?
Don't forget us.
They tried to hide their concerns.
There's a big body in this assembly.

Did you find him?
You want me to go in?
Please get me out of the lighthouse on this side.
Tom shot and killed a tiger.
I've never met anyone before.
How much is the pain?
I want to drink something cold.
What's your difference?

A healthy person does not know the price of health.
Did I miss something interesting?
I had to tell them myself.
The audience has come back with a laugh.
You're not paying attention to me.
I've got a broken spoon.
You like to take a picture, don't you?
He's a knight noble without fear and haste.
They hate women.
I don't have much fun with myself.

Tom yells at Mary.
It's my favorite song.
Do not leave the active engine.
I don't know what's in the box.
Tom kind of said that Mary from Australia.
She knows you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very clever.
Again and again, there are obstacles in our lives, some calling them problems, others talking about opportunities for growth.
Thank you for taking him on a fishing trip.
You won't have that problem.
I prefer to spend time with friends.
Find a solution.

The wind blew.
I rarely met her.
I know this is really important.
I eat apples.

What did the boy say?
I bought everything I planned.
It looks like a virus.
Let me give you my phone number.
I couldn't let her go.
Tom died a year and a half ago.
I knew you'd come back.
These books are old.
Are we leaving now?
Neither Tom nor Mary were ever in Boston.
Have you ever heard of it?
If I had the money, I'd buy a computer.
Tom smiles?
She went to Paris.
He's in school right now, isn't he?
Please let us know.
Tom sneezed and went to the door.
It was just a joke.
Try to prove I'm wrong.
I told you to stay in my room.
Do you have any pain?
He couldn't leave because of a lack of money.
Let me explain how this works.
Open the door, or we'll break it!

Isn't that salty?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
It's an apple.
Tom said he didn't have any money.
Boston is Tom’s favorite city.
I'm sorry when someone dies.
Are you better?
What makes you think that might interest us?

That was a bad rate.
Thought she was going alone, I was worried.
The river is flown in size.
He looks like Johnny Deppa.
I watched them.
Do you really love her?

Is there a message?
Last night, Tom called me suddenly.
We really need that.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the bottles.

She doesn't like my manner of speaking.
Mary wants another baby.
I don't care what you do with your money.
I'd like to see the chief.

We met last week.
Don't believe anything he says.

Tom burns in his oven both wood and coal.
My eyes hurt.
I love stories.
We must be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom dropped Mary his keys.
I talk to him all the time.
I can't laugh at her jokes.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God predestined Jesus Christ’s royal authority and priesthood.
You want me to talk to Tom alone?
Each of us went home.
It's not thin, but it's strong and it doesn't go away.
It's a little stupid.
I don't know what I want right now.
That's amazing.
I don't think you sent me that order.
Six or five in favour of the drivers!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom's interested in biology.

He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him.
I hope no one's seen you come in here.
That's Tom's voice.
Can we bring Tom in?
Tom said I'm not beautiful.
Do you often cry?
We did not expect such results.

We're both very busy.
The subject is invisible.
I get everything I want.
Are you happy to meet me?
I'll go after you.
Tom tried to drown in the bath.
Tom and I are growing up.
I told you to meet me.
Tom is Mary’s younger brother.
You're acting like a fool.
Tom likes playing cards.
The book is big.
Don't talk about Tom like that.
I've made myself clear.
We've been waiting three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Time can change, but the human nature is the same.
Tom looks like something really upset.
I brought the oven.
The following year, Tom will teach French.
I heard it all the time.
That's why I advised you to rest.
Why is that bothering you?
The worst part of the trip is in the back.
We're not going to get you both.
Don't be so stubborn!
I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in the shoulder.
You don't speak French?
How dare you do that!
This knife was very good for me.
How did you know I had it?
You're gonna have to do this for a minute.

We've done everything we can.
I used to be very fat.
They're not coming back.
You don't have to trust any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a white guy in a wheel.

I've already discussed this with Tom.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There's no salvation for her.
I'm sorry he did this without you.
You have blood coming out of your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom's in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants the same thing you do.
We can't just ignore that.
Where did you and Tom meet?
Where's the supermarket near here?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you are lying, join in.
Tom wanted to ask Mary for forgiveness again.
Tom's been thinking.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He was never there.
I really want to go with you, but I can't.
It's never been like that before.
I wasn't going to do that.
I can't believe you.
I bought the bread.
Let's go fast, and you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?

So we didn't have to leave.
Mary recovered after her illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get that?
Eating meat is harmful to your health and your environment.
Are you telling me you don't know anything about it?
What's your plan, Tom?
Tom can't get the pleasure of life.
I want you to say a word for me.
No one likes me.
I'm sorry I don't know Tom's phone.
You told him, "No, he's got it all figured out."
Your explanation was very understandable.
I slept the rest of the day.
I understand more French.
I'm just sure you just thought about something.

I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?

I just had a conversation with your teacher.
I'm used to lying early.
Don't you think I'd help you?
Tom in the office.

You know what that is?

Why are you so direct?
Go to your father and ask.
You still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief comment on each letter.
It's hard for you to take seriously.
The tribes moved along the river.
I'll do it.
I said let them go.
When did it start?
No one's got anything to do with what she thinks.
I don't think that's weird.
"Where did you get my phone?" "That's it."
When are you going to take the wheat off?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do it.
Does that make sense?
Why are you closing the door?

He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane will fly at eight o'clock tomorrow.
We can try.
Give it to her.

I like to travel around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom's not high, but strong.
It's cold this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Please find Tom.
He'll give it to you.
This proposal is not clear.
What would you do?
He's gone to the crowd.
What, you don't understand what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
You think you're fat?

Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This lesson is endless!
This box weighs a ton.
He gets it because he's a jockey.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

He said he was going to kiss me.
Don't look at me.
You're having fun?
That's hardly gonna happen.
I'll order it later.
You didn't know Tom was going to Boston?
It's our school.
I was free all day yesterday, and I'm working today.
Take your coat, it's cold today.
If you think about it, I really need a cell phone.

Last summer, they went to a mountain resort.
You're not going to tell me where the nearest church is?

Can you come closer?
She's slowing down.
What kind of action do you expect from Tom?
She seemed totally calm.
Push the button.

I don't see any problems here.
I don't have to do this tomorrow.
He lost his sunglasses.
It's awfully bitter.
Tom told you where he was last night?
I can improve you on your way to work.

Last time Tom was the first.
It's different.
I have to see you.
I lost your phone.
Put the tree out there.
You usually wear a bike helmet?
Tom will do it.

Mother was busy preparing for dinner.
I don't know what you're trying to say.

Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
How's my story?

The church, located on the hill, opens up a beautiful view.
The goats don't like to sneeze and find shelter faster than sheep and other domestic cats.
He told me he needed more time.
Tom died two years ago in a plane crash.
My older brother, Tom, was born here in Boston.
I thought you hated him.
"Now leave X-Wing, Your Majesty." "I am going to space." "As it is written, you are a goat!"
I felt the smell of food long before I got home.
My father put a mailbox in the red.
A lot of people ignore laughs.
Besides Tom, everyone in the family speaks French more.
I'm not that young to know.
Do not pay attention to them.
I know you don't like me.
The police found Tom dead on the wing.
I'm not as happy as you are.
I did everything you asked me to do.
Are you planning on buying a house?
On the table of the cat.
Tom says he doesn't want to go to Australia with me.
He came, he saw, he won.
Life is not always fair.
I saw Tom take your keys.
The whole night was exported because of Tom and Mary's battle.
Can you read it?
We need more farmers.
Tell us more about your trip.
Six degrees below zero.
I don't expect you to believe that.
We've seen a lot of unusual plants in the botanical garden.
Sometimes a small gift can be a manifestation of great love.
Are you a blonde or a brunette?
I didn't sit on the bus.
That's why I didn't like the movie.
You want us to help you?
Be realistic.
Tom planned to set up a party.
I'll call someone for help.
Why didn't you tell us about it before?
Is it Chinese or Japanese?
Burn it.
I'm making a success.
You're pale as a ghost.
I'll be home by six.
The French isn't that complicated.
Let's get out of the cab.
He was sitting.
Tom never missed school.
I suggest you do this today.
I'm not going to marry her.
Tom's drinking apple juice.
You're going on a train?
We think so too.
How could something like this happen?
You're an actress.
Tom was mentally ill.
I forgot to ask.
I always have my hands and feet frozen.
How can I translate words that are not in any language other than mine?
Could you tie that tape?
I'll go home.
She always keeps her room clean.
I hate people like Tom.
I asked Tom to wait for us.
We're stuck in a hole.
Tom is very angry with me.
I used to shave my head once a week.
Eleven is a simple number.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Coffee for my account.
We're husband and wife.
Jacksons invited us to dinner tonight.
Tom was impartial.
In October, the leaves begin to fall.
Melanie said she likes to swim.
What's wrong with you?
Now I'm too busy to talk to you.
The captain is in charge of his ship and command.
Tom says he wants to be buried here.
Where do you share the disunity?
Three of the prisoners escaped.
Thank God!
You think Tom knows?
This time I'm crying.
Tom took himself as a child.
Stop singing.
There were only six people at the party.
What did you decide?
I didn't know you were romantic.
I saw you spying on Tom.
I need you to do this right now.
The counter walked into the house through that door.
I know how to survive.
Mary worked most of her life.
Mary's boy's name is Tom.
I'm afraid I have something to admit.
It was expected that Tom would be there yesterday.
Tom was an important person.
I want you to stay with me.
He's in the hospital.
Don't forget to sign up.
You'll be safe there.
I'm in Tehran.
"Are you speaking Greek?" "Not yet, this is my first lesson!"
Why did you give him the money?
Tom bought something for Mary?
You went to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis yesterday.
Let me do it again.
We must respect their wishes.
How did you deal with her?
I was already in Sapporo.
I told you to get out of here.
We're going to do our best.
Would you buy that?
Tom's gonna be late for the plane.
She's always getting up early.
You want her to help you?
You eat rice every day?
We were sitting in the deepest auditorium.
You'll survive.
What did she buy in that store?
When's the president gonna have a woman?
He's here to see you.
I'm glad Tom did it.
I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen that movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is not far from our school.
It's hot. I'm hot for you.
England looks like Japan in many ways.
I'd never do that to Tom.
I suggest you try harder.
This dog doesn't scare a baby.
Don't resist.
Tom has the keys.
When I'm in a bad mood, I like to think of the mountains to get rid of them.
How would you feel if someone did that to you?
We both really want to sleep.
Tom just can't do everything he wants.
Tom often tells us anecdotes.
Luke can be used in many ways.
There's almost no snow here.
I asked Tom to help us.
The mollusk hit the tree.
You speak English?
My brother's gonna kill me.
I opened my wallet.
Tom can stay with me.
Is it difficult to learn Greek?
Tom's coming with you?
Where's the remote control?
I can't find her either.
You're going to speak Swedish.
Have you seen anyone else?
Tell me why you're here.
Don't put the tube on.
Tell him not to look at him.
We looked in the window, but we didn't see anything.
You want to work with them?
The movie was interesting.
I'm out of power, working from tomorrow to dinner.
How far are we going?
It's a fake.
Tom's very emotional.
Why are you avoiding me?
What about Tom?
I hope you don't get cold.
He was shot in the bird.
Tom's leaving on Monday.
Oh, come on!
I need to go further.
She had a nose for a glass.
There is no difference in the English language between Ser and Ser.
I know exactly what to do.
He's very secretive.
You have excellent English.
Do I have any messages?
Tom didn't want to cry.
How much time do you have?
Writing a text message, driving a car, it's very dangerous.
Tom said Mary agreed.
Tom said Mary won't win.
Why'd you take off your beard?
I want to go back to this house.
How much lunch do you have?
The black villa was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Foum to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he should explain it to me.
I was very calm.
Everybody's got something to hide.
We'll have a few guests tonight.
Her voice will still ring in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
It's all over time.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw it on the roof of the basket.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't miss the case.
Why don't we have dinner tonight at the restaurant?
Some birds didn't fly.
What else do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you about?
I said 'cause you came to Australia.
Did you want that?
Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where am I waiting for you?
I was really worried about you.
What did you find?
Can you explain that to me?
We were hit by a snowstorm.
The book is on the table.
I don't want any of them.
What are we gonna lose?
You'd better ask him first.
He's been fired against his wishes.
Take them to the hospital.
Tom told you where he bought his pipe?
She didn't answer his letter.
I hired someone today.
Stop kicking the fuck out of it!
Tom would like us to stay.
I'm on the stairs.
It's the biggest car in the world.
Tom's almost never asking why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me Mary didn't do that.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I've already done it.
What's the weather?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
You're not gonna introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She cried.
I told you because Mary had to do it.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living behind the city?
How long have you been up to this time?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's leader.
Who are you planning to go to Australia with?
Someone screamed.
Which one is better?
We thank you for your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't tell him to leave.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train goes to three thirty.
I know you're hiding something.
Release the beast from the cell.
He's afraid of the basket.
You look like a father.
George is five years older than me.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as you've been told.
Please take a look at this movie.
Someone's calling.
I ran away.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't love your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're way above Tom.
You can use his library.
I congratulated him on his son's birth.
Mary says she needs more time.
Foma walked away from the door.
My father is an English teacher.
Tom and Mary gave their grandson a bicycle for Christmas.
Hold on to the pearl.
Is that what you did?
I'd like you to translate this into French.
How many bottles on the table?
The lawyer has convincing evidence that she's innocent.
Maybe.
I don't love Tom anymore.
Who's Tom with?
Tara has a strong sense of responsibility.
We both saw him.
We have to help.
Tom just left the prison.
Did you tell me that?
Me!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've developed a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did all this.
I don't want to hear your theories.
Tom told me what I wanted to know.
Only the philosophy can be used as evidence and appreciated.
I can't afford to have children.
When I spoke to them in French in Paris, they only wept at me, and they couldn't make them understand their own language.
I'm leaving?
I was so stupid that I believed in it.
She really did.
I think it's very expensive.
I'll open it.
My mother must be angry.
White bread, please.
The owls are sweet.
Tom is illiterate.
I think Tom's still out of work.
We're perfect for each other.
French is complicated, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
The danger was gone.
We need more wood.
Tom said Mary was upset.
Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before he does.
He must miss her.
He says he's not sick.
Paris away?
How much time is Tokyo now?
He said he was hoping to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told to do.
Frieda Kalo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim's not coming today.
You'll be a father, you'll get it.
Last Monday I saw you and Tom.
Where did you take off your shoes?
We went to the beach.
What do you think this year will be snow for Christmas?
How was Tom's party?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I owe it to one of my friends in the palace.
I'll work for you if you pay me as well.
I'd like a cup of coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth in a while.
You're the only one here who likes Tom.
I know what Tom would do.
You won't have a second chance like that.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
All accounts have to pay me.
She swallowed it.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom taps Mary's hair.
Tom didn't seem happy.
When I grow up, I want to be a fireman.
Tom's been dry with his mother regularly.
We forgot to register!
Tom said he likes it here.
No, I'm not tired.
She's the most lazy of all I know.
Is Mary already gone to her room?
This time I forgive him.
I like Chinese food very much.
It's just what you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He's a vigilante.
Alvaro from Venezuela, he's a Venezuelan.
That's the count.
He insulted me in public.
Tom won't win anymore.
Why don't I stay with you?
Induction plates are used for direct heating of castrel and cobwebs.
I cried.
Tom wants to learn to play trombone.
Get out of here now.
May I take a look at your rights?
I'm going to take you with 1,000 songs to replace the mill on these jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot the sweater.
Tom lives in Australia.
I didn't know what to start with.
That's what I remember!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets to the concert.
I had to go to Australia with you.
Tom's burning his ass.
He dictated several letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in the pajamas?
How much is that worth?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to look after the garden.
A glass of quality weighs about a hundred and eighty grams.
I had to leave a note.
Are you Canadian?
You're stronger, Tom.
I'm waiting for a half-third of Tom.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary are doing this together.
Anybody else noticed that?
This proposal is not in English.
I think Tom's good.
She played the sonata.
You can write in any language you want. In Tatoeba all languages are equal.
The infection went into the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a present.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
You'll ever thank me.
Tom's watching TV sometimes.
I'm ready?
I was waiting for you.
I still have a bad idea.
Get out of here! Get out of here!
I saw a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I just fell asleep after two hours of sleep.
Mary did not suffer from thirst.
So it was not as difficult to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I was trying to wake Tom up.
They say that the movie is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late for heavy rain.
Well, she's healthy, by the way.
Tom was in a broken hat.
Watch out for a brother.
Tom said he wasn't waiting for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you eaten yet?
I love bitter peppers.
How long do you usually get up on Saturday?
I added the milk to the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain accepted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There are no invincibles.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can paint.
They're stuck.
I didn't know what it would be impossible to do.
Are you having fun?
A man was sentenced to death.
Was it snow yesterday?
You scared her.
You don't get Tom.
Did you kill her?
Does he know French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary almost one year old.
I was impressed.
You don't have the advice.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the zoo.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary for self-defense.
What is the difference between faith and trust?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you know?
If the weather allows, tomorrow we'll take to the top of the mountain.
We're both familiar with him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to figure it out.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read the old handkerchief.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Tom saw it?
The more I thought about the problem, the more complicated it seemed.
His black eyes shined and his face was uncovered, and his normally pale face was brought back to life and covered with a Roman.
What kind of pizza do you love most?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Take more.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands were cold.
You want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
I find it hard to solve this problem.
Typhon destroyed many homes.
This man was promised to die.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Is there anyone here who can speak French?
I think Tom's still living in Boston.
Let me take your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
The authority in Tom's hands.
I've learned to do and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
Nobody's gonna blame you.
I'm not busy right now.
Children like to play more than they like to learn.
He was accepted by his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Think of the language I speak.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My guy's a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who talk about politics.
Is it red or white?
We're not afraid of fear.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
I'm going!
Do it until it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife in.
What, did you suddenly get into fashion?
Tom said he wouldn't want to spend so much time on it.
You're bitter.
Our granddaughter was born last night.
Tom's suit is the pirate.
It's pure truth!
Let's go for a drink.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
It's my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom must be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes that Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink any more wine.
I'll take you out.
We are proud of our achievements.
So Mary had to be invited.
Tom had to be punished.
You're in love?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not a girl.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I'll be out every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you going to say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime have you committed?
How do we know that this man is the one for whom he betrays himself?
King Harald Gormsson, known as Harald Sinezubius, introduced Christianity to Denmark.
We can't do anything for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
That's why Tom could stay a little longer.
Almost all of them were dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad has happened.
The last few days have been very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to smell flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
Then Tom never saw Mary.
You can't be in this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read German Gess.
I'm telling you the truth, I've never spoken Portuguese.
When criminal proceedings are brought before a court, it is generally assumed that the jury will have twelve persons.
What exactly did Tom do at the Australia Embassy?
Tom and I are getting together.
The boys marched four in a row.
Tom was very busy.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very acidic.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea what Tom was going to do.
Here's another day.
You have to do this right now.
I have to go to X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We're impartial.
I've got mosquito bites all over my hand.
Tom, come on, we're gonna be late.
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you following your weight?
Tom's playing trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her not to be in my house.
You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
MacDonalds is world famous for his hamburgers.
Tom made Mary a precious gift.
Do you have any idea?
Do you like these spirits?
The castle is broken.
Diamond is a precious stone.
Enjoy the stove, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English words.
Put it down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They want the best.
Tom works as an officer.
Tonight's gonna be cold.
She says she'll be waiting for us.
Why do so many suffer from low self - esteem?
Was that too simple?
What Alice faced as she waited for the answer was a sudden war, which was so loud that she broke her drums, and so loud that she could reach heaven.
I lost him in the crowd.
We talked about Jim when he went into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
So you can't go there.
Tom helped Mary bring things in the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did was wrong.
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom was reluctant to give Mary the money she asked for.
What do you hate her for?
My steering car broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I tried very hard to solve the problem.
You should have done homework.
I spoke on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This rock was so heavy I couldn't lift it up.
Why didn't Tom ask?
He'll open up and respond.
We took a canoe.
Have you ever tasted banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom remarkable?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look at the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his zont.
How can we explain this to our children?
I didn't even know your names.
The bee went into the tree.
The language I'm learning is very complex.
Your child can walk.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I'd rather not marry her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm getting married.
Are you really the only one alive?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom's my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We would like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The President is four years old.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have?
You couldn't solve that question?
And Tom and Mary here.
So what would you do that for?
Twenty floors in the building.
If you don't go, I won't go either.
You don't happen to come back to Tom, do you?
I don't have a picture of Tom.
Can you wait a minute?
Are you going to give something for Christmas?
She won't let him go.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he were to follow my advice, he would now be a rich man.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
A strong wind rose.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to push the parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you are.
We're not as young as Tom.
How much do you plan to be home tonight?
The sum is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's straight as a dwelling.
I think you might be.
She knew she wasn't right.
It's so cool!
Tom had a feeling that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I came home, he watched TV.
Tom was talking last night in a dream.
Tom's ready to protect himself.
You're never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but I picked up some girl.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell you 'cause you called.
Tom's very strict with the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He's ready for the worst.
The beginning of history was interesting.
I thought Tom was interested.
I'm mixing Mayonese with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom's got a little push.
Did you understand what she said?
You're kind of dissatisfaction.
Don't hurt her.
I'd better stay.
So there was a brilliant idea.
She's breathing now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a place of need?
I didn't know why Tom's late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe everything's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and tidy.
I suspect that's why we have to go to Boston next week.
Don't go anywhere else.
Tom was terrified.
Tom's face is gorgeous.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
He's afraid of his own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept; he always had enough food.
The hall needs a new yard.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was rain yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of the cross?
How far do you want to go?
She had leg pain.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to take you to the hospital.
What's the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom did it a lot.
I hope we don't do that anymore.
How many times have you been able to do that?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
That's the precious thing.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get it, it's time to open.
I'm not sure what size she has.
He was also good to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom put a bell and walked into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll leave as soon as the rain stops.
Foma's gone from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't think of Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was widowed.
Who doesn't admire them?
We cried with him.
You don't want to try again?
Wait till you hear it.
What'd you break up for?
You can make oil, cheese and a lot of other milk.
You don't have the authority to do this.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you her relative?
When you drink water, don't forget those who've dug a well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for the younger daughter.
Have a good time.
Do you like jazz?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.

Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He sneezed in the answer.

I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You'll get it if you try.
You didn't mean to ask Tom for help?
Try it.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Couldn't you say that in human language?

Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.

I've had it all wrong.
She suffocated him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Is it gonna hurt?
The girl had a big red hat.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom's been fooled.
I called you here to ask you a question.
Who are you playing with?
I need a light coat.

It's a cat.
Please tell me it's not true.
You're not coming in?
I refurbished his radio.
It's a very bad idea.
Tom's above you.
Tom found work without work.
This book in public access?
Please, can't you talk louder?
I'll tell him to contact Mary.

He looks like a girl.
Please address me, not like James Matthewevich.
She's not alone anymore.

You won't need it.
Tom rarely goes to parties.
You're not my mother.
Tell them we're going.
I look like a guy who wants to marry?
I closed the door, but don't shut it.
So you should be careful not to kiss Mary publicly.
Can we help them?
Thank you for calling me back.
They're happy.
Please don't be so harsh with me.
Now I'm in charge of the parade!

She thought I'd take her.
I'm living in Boston now.
Tom brought his secret to his grave.
You really want to put your money in that bank?
I don't think anyone else wants to do this.
We're teachers.
I think I like you very much.
Why are you so worried about her?
I'll never do it again.
Are there visitors?

Tom paid Mary a very good salary.
What do you think?
Let's hurry up tomorrow.

Where's Tom's keys?
Am I right to say your name?

I'm a married man.
He bought his son a camera.
Shut up and eat.

I'm not coming.
Tom doesn't spend much time thinking about money.
So we have to go with Mary.
It's interesting what Tom's doing here.
You can't.
I don't think I can go faster.
Tom's got questions left.
Are you looking for someone?
Tom's hand tasted the murena.
So we didn't have to hide.

Tom claimed to have seen the UFO.
I know who you were with.

Do you have a car problem?
At the tourist information centre, the map of the city was given to all those who wished.

I've tried all my hard work.
That's a good sign.
Some are convinced that they are protected by the guardian angel.
Tom broke his bank account.
She's in the hotel right now.
What's going to happen to me?
He was so interested that he paid attention to it.
I told him I didn't care.

We're both here for the same reason.
Love is strong, and money is stronger.
I saw him naked.
In our library a lot of children's books.

When does this end?

A five-year-old left behind.

Tom didn't show me anything.
I hate driving.
They're fake.
When you're back, I'm gone.
Did you talk to him today?
I thought you stopped seeing him.
Tom calls Mary.
She's swallowing flowers.
A woman often calls me when she goes abroad.
You're in bed.
First of all, I would like to make a clear statement of my position.
Tom can play the gang.
Tom didn't decide what to do.
He doesn't like coffee.
Please turn on the radio.

I thought you hated us.
Think carefully before you answer.
Tom says Mary needs more time.
I took that as a joke and I didn't answer.
Actually, he wasn't called Tom Jackson.
Is that sarcasm?
Don't do what you'll regret.
Do you envy her?
I hope I can stay here for a long time.
Payments will be made according to experience and education.
I think Tom's right.
You don't have to do sports.
Tom told me you were married.
I thought I wouldn't stay.
We're looking forward to you and your family.
Did you change her?
I told you I changed my mind.
Why did you say that?
You have to work hard if you want to succeed.
There's no exception in the experiment.
If you need help, say it.
Can I go home early today?
You wouldn't survive for anything.
Tom didn't think Mary would upset it.
There's a commercial area nearby.
Mary thinks she's the smartest.
Use your fist.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
I remember you.
It's interesting news.
Tom is a bitter drink.
We don't even know her.
Tom made a few suggestions and checked them on Mary before hitting Tatoebu.
I know where you're wasting your money.
The school's finally over.
It's a long drive.

Caffeine's empty.
Write in a quadrandash, please.
We can't go.
He was aware of his crime.
It's the most beautiful picture of all I've ever seen.
What are you doing here?
He's worried about something.
Claudia's time was thinking about psychoanalysis.
Tom would never agree to that.
You need to find a job.
He'll be back later today too.
She's very proud of herself.
I left about half a third.
Don't leave a strip on the sun.
I already knew that.
I watched them leave.
I'm surprised you remember them.

Come on in.
I'll keep them for my grandchildren.

I had to get under arrest.
The firemen couldn't hold the flames.
Help finally came.
It's a horse.

Luckily, he didn't die in an accident.
He often sits down for hours reading books.
I had no idea you could do that.
Tom's been unloading the car.
Tom knew about Mary something John didn't know.
No answer.
We need to call him.
Are you busy?
I raised my head negatively.
Tom, they're calling you.
You promised you wouldn't drink today.
Are you ready for tomorrow?
We checked.
Come see what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think that's how it works.
I didn't do that.
Tom told me he'd come back.
How long are you coming in tomorrow?
A box with openings.
Did you talk to Tom about this?
Is that a flying mouse?
She'll take you to the airport.
Tell me what else I need to know.
You can't make me marry you.
That's pretty weird.
The leaves are yellow.
I woke up, and she's not.
We have a lot of food today.
He spoke with a word in which he supported my point of view.

Why don't you go with her?
Why didn't you just tell them?
I can't rule it out.

I need to get back to Boston.
Sit down, please.
Wake up, Tom.
Here's a map.
You should have stayed with us.
Let's imagine that we're inplanetati.

I have nothing to say to you.
I'd rather you don't talk about it.
I didn't want to go anyway.
I'm not going to complain.
They kept their love secret.
She just got into the car just to be late for the train.
Don't say that to my bride.
Tom was tired of the need to pay the bill when they and Mary were going to the meeting.
I strongly recommend that you reconsider your decision.
I'm not worried about your past.
The police searched Tom's car.
Although I felt something strange, I didn't know it was.
Are you a pig?
I went to the army.
Why can't you take me as I am?
Black bear.
Tom doesn't know what Mary did.
I don't know who's gonna be at the meeting.
It's hard to get to the president.
If you're hungry, eat.
I was terribly scared.
He's no longer a member of our club.
I'll do it right away.
I don't trust her.
Six is equal to eighteen.
‘Scala’ is an anagram of ‘lazy’.
I've never seen Tom help anyone.
Dan took part in a meeting against racism.
You did it fast.
I need to spend two minutes in advance.
He's on her side.
I didn't forget your betrayal.
I think you did great.
She danced so gracefully that she surprised all of us.
It's where she worked as a secretary.
They're not that bad.
I thought I had everything.
Don't worry, it's gonna be okay.

That's not true.
You are no longer allowed to do this.

Nobody heard the call.
How did it get here?

Thank you so much, you just ruined my life!

We'll see you soon.
Let's divorce.
He won't find any keys.
Her manner of speaking makes me nervous.
Eat what you like.
And then what happened?
Do you think he likes me?
Tom agreed to help Mary do that.
He prefers not to talk about it.
I let them sleep until noon.
I just wanted to go back to my old life.
I'm sorry she yelled at you.
I've already told you everything you think you know about it.
Health gives a person freedom, which most people do not realize until it is gone.
Does that matter?
I know Tom's secret.
Tom is a man.
That's not nice.
No one could believe it.
Tell her I'm fixing the fridge.
That's amazing.
The rabbit's got blood flowing out of his ear.
Postmodernism differs from modernism.
I've already read this book.
I'd fucking take it!
He's showing great enthusiasm.
Maybe you should call the police.
Did you report this to the police?
You really think Tom's sick?
I'm not afraid of that at all.
I don't have much money you think.
I'm selling clothes on the Internet.
I could do anything faster when I was young.
I wasn't worried.
John, the tallest boy in our class, is called Mr. High.

Do you know him?
I was, in general, all the same.

I didn't have to come here.
Don't make such an acid face!
That white one?
Tom came first.
They've been hearing strange things about them.
That's amazing.
The sky is covered with the beatings.
This bird is under threat of extinction.
You've made her very happy.
How do you live?
I mean, like Tom, he felt like he was having fun.
I'm all tied up in my throat.
You said it was important.
He said he'll be back right now.
They have a lot of information.
Everyone in the village called her Green Shapeck.
I don't want to.
It's time to get the kids to sleep.
This work can be done.
I've had a lot of time to rest.
Tom won't object.
It's okay.
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.
Did you take the medicine?
Many people believe in the corruption of officials of our country.
Did he get his pants off?
I can't distinguish him from my brother.
We can count on him.
I'll go with her.
Did the phone wake you up?
I really need someone to eat.
I don't think Tom has any experience.
Come on, now.

Pets allowed.
Tom's full of hope.
He speaks French, as well as of course English.
Get that rock out of here, please.
"He's getting married." "And who's the happy picker?"
I've been thinking about you all day.
It's good news.
I can't pay you.
That's what I found in the cave.
I think I impressed him.
The train will be at this station for about two minutes.
Grow up, Tom.
I want to sleep with your wife.
What do you think would be the safest place?
I know your father.
I heard you scream.
He's the guy who drew this picture.
"Call up" means call on the phone.
Who'd notice?

Do you have a question?
They went into the woods.
I'm talking too much.
You show me the way.
Light shines the sun.
The coral reefs are life - giving.
Tom said he knew what Mary was planning to do.
You never wanted to talk about it.
We hope for the best.
I didn't expect Tom and Mary to be here.
Last night the temperature dropped below zero.
"You can't carry it." "Why not?"
Tom did a bad job.
I knew Tom wasn't in Australia.
My eyes are the ocean in which my dreams are reflected.
In a big city like Tokyo, I prefer walking, not driving.
As it turned out here, it's not possible to know now.
Now Tom has his own room.
I didn't know her first.
A number of votes have been taken.
You lied to us, didn't you?
I don't think Tom can help you right now.
He'll probably be here soon.
He didn't really realize that this was a differential equation.
I know that's probably it.
Be an adult, Tom.
Can you distinguish Tom from his twin brother?
I'm not paid for it.
Tom had a loosely broken sex board.
Don't hesitate.
How did you know where Tom was?
She says she'll do it on Monday.
Tom's too fast.
The popularity of the phone has led to fewer people writing letters in our day.
I think we're almost ready.
The woman came to our town three years ago.
So you're not going to help us?
My stomach's dead, and I'm terribly upset.
She's above the sister.
I have a pink car.
So quiet.
In the most beautiful colors are the sharpest rods.
You better hide.
Tom's in line.
It's just not going to happen.
They can't afford it.
What colors do you like?
She says she feels very tired.
It doesn't matter.
Tom had a happy childhood.
I just got back from Boston.
Why did Tom run away?
Tom doesn't know what Iraq is different from Iran.
So they told themselves not to.
Two days ago, I caught a cold.
I was waiting for him.
You don't have to do this.
Let's have some coffee or something.
You have something in your pockets, don't you?
Ask Tom-- he'll tell you the same thing.
I saw that helicopter myself and took off my hands.
I'm with you.
You want to end up like him?
I thought about him.
I'm waiting for someone.
Are you going to the theater tonight?
You have to protect yourself.
There's no conditioner in my house.
Tom and Mary are studying French together.
My boss is very happy today.
They blocked his proposal.
I admire your courage.
Tom hoped that Mary would stay in Boston for a while.
Don't make me do it again.
Sooner or later, Bashar!
You're worthless.
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I visited Boston.
Excuse me, couldn't you repeat the question?
What do you think they're doing to Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary's gonna do it.
I don't want anyone to do that.
Tom's gonna be working on these exits.
Give her the phone, please.
No one could see us.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.
The President ' s efforts to strengthen arms control were accompanied by powerful weapons lobbys.
I think we know each other.
You're underestimating Tom.
Don't worry, Tom.
I'll try to express it in English.
Give it to me, please.
We need to talk to her.
Time is enough for you.
We had to plan more carefully.
You need to sleep.
I'm proud of my father's good fortune.
Is there anything else you want to tell me?
Foma tried to explain the situation to Masha.
I told her it was a mistake.
He's her manager.
Tom didn't have it.
Nobody paid attention to me.
So there were thirteen at the time.
I'm going to Boston for a bus.
Tom wants to try a new shampoo.
Tom grew up in these places.
You have to pay in advance.
Did you make coffee?
You could tell the truth.
She's just thinking about herself.
You usually talk too fast.
We both speak French.
Look at yourself like a suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
That's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?
Tom hid the fact that he was in prison.
We're better than Spartacus!
That's how he was celebrating his birthday.
Why did he need it?
It's a capital investment.
It's really bad.
Time didn't catch up with that.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the ring?
Meg didn't even look at me.
You promise?
I know you did it on purpose.
It's time to find out.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about here.
You've always been a winner.
Network!
I used to live on Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've already read it.
That's thanks to you.
Until certain conditions are met.
She's not like everything.
Social networks allow you to find a lot of information about a person before you meet him.
What really happened in the last exits in Boston?
What Is the Meaning of Learning?
These Persians aren't very sweet.
I don't think these black Fridays can be pulled out.
I told you everything I had to tell you.
No, I didn't.
Let me pay her.
I can't forgive his lazys.
Tell me you're kidding!
I'm a realist.
I heard Tom got out of school.
Tom said he was very lonely.
I didn't tell my friends I was going to Australia.
Kim's four years older than me.
Why aren't you in shape?
Tom just wanted to make sure that's what you meant.
Tom sent his daughter to sleep without dinner.
I'm coming with you.
They cleared the snow road.
Tom and Mary have to do this together.
They offered us their help.
Tom was determined to kiss Mashu.
Are you very hungry?
What's going to happen to him?
Tom and I are friends with each other.
Where do you think you're going?
I had blood in my urine.
You can't always win.
It's kind of a celebrity.
Jimmy knows everything about cars.
I've seen them all.
As everyone knows, he's a genius.
The painting hangs on the walls.
Mary said she'd win.
I want this dog.
Tom with you?
The boy's afraid of the dark.
That's why I made dinner.
Russia has become a second superpower.
I'm worried about them, too.
He went to the mail to send a letter.
Remove this powder in a glass of water.
You're going with her?
Let's get one of those ready-to-be dinners sold in the car.
Tom tried to kill them.
She says she's happy.
You want to go abroad?
Don't accuse the government.
Put him in place.
How did you get to know each other?
Who sent this letter?
Drop the guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rent per apartment in Manhattan is about $40,000 a month.
You won't find them.
Tom is the only one who survived.
Are you going to buy this car?
You're talking like my grandmother.
I don't have any relatives.
Let's see something else.
You think it's a real translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both really wanted it.
So there's nothing to do here.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop here!
You're very helpful.
Don't stop at the door.
You should take his age into account.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you didn't like pizza.
Tom's got to suspect something's wrong.
What if he comes back now?
If you get up, sleep!
I'm afraid I don't have time.
Didn't you know that Mary was Tom's wife?
I need to move on.

I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do that.
We're here to wish you luck.
Do you remember his name?
Tom put the toys in a box for the toys.
I don't want you to ride.
He said he'd come.
"Doctor, I'm being ignored." "Next!"
He has one purpose in life: to make money.
He gave dogs a piece of meat.
It's a letter to you.
Uncle Tom couldn't read.
I'm not a doctor, I'm a teacher.
She said she liked him.
Should I go with you?
Give him the microphone.
Tom spent the night at the hotel.
I explained that to her.
Tom's indecisive.
The nuclear baton!
I'll take my leave if it rains.
It's gotta be real.
There's something else I want to talk to you about.
It's the tallest building I've ever seen.
It'll cut my ears.
What are you doing tomorrow night?
Are you a musician?
It's been ten years since my mother died.
The mixture of three basic colors is black.
Take it easy.
When do you want to meet?
She doesn't like the new job.
I didn't want the neighbors to see me naked.
The operation was successful.
Will Tom still be in the hospital for a long time?
I want you to stay with her.
I'll make him pay the money.
You must respect them.
I'm waiting for you in Turin!
You didn't look tired.
I'll pray earnestly.
What will you do if the war begins again?
Tom said he'd do the same.
I'm not going to Australia this year.
The best known gold scarf is the California Gold scarf, which began in 1848.
You know why Tom doesn't trust Mary?
Show me your picture.
I'll meet new people every day.
I want to go see him.
You cheated on Tom.
What are you doing in my room?
We miss it so much.
He answered his parents.
Tom, are you out?
Who did you give it to?
I held him as a crow.
Nobody's asking you to do this.
I forgot that this is the first April.
Please stop singing that song!
Tom tasted the dog.
I know you're out early.
Tom's been doing this all morning.
I'm aware of the consequences.
To the east and west, the city divides the river.
Why are you looking?
Do you know anyone who speaks French?
That's why it was scary?
Tom invited me to stay the night.
I don't think Tom's fault.
I'd love you to stay.
I'm impressed by your French.
We both want to do it.
If the ice warms up, it grows.
We could have done that.
The doctor said that's why we need surgery.
I just changed my toothpaste.
Here's something for you.
It's your bedroom.
Tom is realistic.
Who's knocking at my door?
When and where did you and Tom meet?
I've come to visit you.
I feel like an amphibian.
Our team came home with a triumph.
I went alone.
Tom married an older girl.
I heard him.
Why don't you sleep?
Did he come to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you cry.
Show me how to do it!
Everybody's quiet.
Let the dust sink.
Why are you so stubborn?
He got stuck in his Chinese teacher, but with all these hormonal cases, he got stuck in almost every meeting.
I'm glad to inform you that I'm completely cured.
I've written a lot of suggestions for the expert.
I like watermelon more than a pastel.
I can't make an exception.
He thinks fast.
I can find them.
I'm here now.
You have the right to a lawyer.
Don't sit too close to the TV.
I'm my head almost every day.
To my surprise, he didn't give up.
Did you steal it?
She must be mad at me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My father likes a fish like me.
Hey, it's me.
Dan showed himself to be the champion of the white race.
I'll try to get them out of here.
I like the color of your shirt.
It's not me, I swear!
I don't think Tom speaks French.
My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom's better ready than I am.
He's floating like a tortoise.
Tom didn't tell Mary what he needed to buy.
She brought the butter.
"Tom, turn around." "I'm going!"
I have a big problem.
We're not partners.
We have already faced this problem.
I'm trying to say that in French.
I'm not like everything else.
I managed to get two tickets to the concert.
He likes to boast about his father's successful car business.
She's in the sunscreen.
Come on, Emily, your father's waiting for you.
How many hours can you sit in front of the computer?
Tom can barely walk.
Minus per minus plus.
In the basement.
Please make a donation.
I really need to talk to you.
Tell me something.
I prefer to travel on my own.
Ankara, capital of Turkey.
I went to the stable.
I prefer a simpler approach.
They're cool.
I went out with my friends.
Jane's kind of hurt us a lot.
I'm trying not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You look stunning.
I'm grateful for your help.
He couldn't hold a smile.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boyfriend"?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is learning that you didn't even know you didn't.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should have thought well before making her pregnant.
Tom says he's not getting married to Mary.
I got two fish.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's fainted.
I'm not sick.
Professor Hudson is my father’s friend.
Can I come too?
Does Tom earn enough to live in the city?
The questioning is over.
Please turn off the radio.
He said he wasn't sure about his answers.
I heard about Tom and Mary.
Take your jacket off if you're warm.
So many of them.
He couldn't follow the principles.
Mary says she's alone.
You'll probably have three hours to go.
That was an easy decision.
Mary said she'd come sooner.
I want to open my own restaurant.
Are you still buying lottery tickets?
That could be anyone.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was a Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom has a rich imagination.
Finally, she solved the problem.
The main thing is to tell the truth.
I don't want Tom singing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
I had nothing wrong with it.
Tom maintains purity in his room.
These three books are therefore of interest to us.
He jumped from one topic to the other.
It's a truce.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom's coming in.
It's not cold today.
I mistakenly put Tom's shirt on.
It seems that the bank's robbery was planned into the mill.
So he didn't like it, but he bought it anyway.
Hold on a second.
I want to talk to you about something.
The bank is empty.
Why didn't you show her why?
Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I was swimming in the river.
Tell them to take off the tube.
Can you tell us what it is?
Say "no" racism.
Tom's a meatball, right?
Don't make me kill you!
What do you like more?
They don't respect him.
No selection.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
Don't hurt us.
You can't answer that.
Tom's got a lot of books.
Can you distinguish the alligator from the crocodile?
Wait, that's what?
My grandfather built this house.
Do you want to take advantage of this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did it for the first time today.
I came to Australia when I was a child.
You really want me to say 'cause it's you who killed his father?
Your teacher called me.
I'm your father.
Can I do it myself?
All the people were touched by his speech.
Do you know how dangerous this is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower in the morning?
Yeah, everybody, listen up, please.
It's made of wood or metal?
Excuse me!
I think Tom is my friend.
In view of being ignorant and free, the nation expects what never was and never will be.
Tom's just breathing.
Dogs don't change colors.
Tom poured water out of the bottle before filling it with fresh water.
Dogs are faithful animals.
Tom's house was almost completely destroyed.
You're so stupid.
Tom knows you can't speak French?
Two boats on the lake.
I'm not gonna call you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It's better to be one than in a bad company.
It's an incredible data.
There is a difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom's lazy.
We need to say that he doesn't do that anymore.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he looks.
Come closer.
We stopped at Hilton.
That's why it's worth telling Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She kept complaining that there was no money left.
Don't you think you should call that?
There's something you need to do.
She gave him a present.
Mary's in her room.
Attention!
In that very moment, I fell in love with this language.
He's safe, isn't he?
Is that what you ordered this pizza?
I need you to help me with that.
Tom's my close friend.
Don't do two things at the same time.
You didn't have to go into the woods alone.
No one sees my tears.
Tom slept again.
She likes you very much.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are multi-faceted.
He's never kissed anyone before.
I'll tell them you're in.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm so happy to meet you.
I didn't forget about the congregation.
They had a wedding last autumn.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!
Everyone knows we didn't.
I thought Tom was never in Boston.
She learned to swim when she was five years old.
We complained to the noise manager in the neighborhood.
I'm not gonna let you do that.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need it.
Honesty is one of the righteous.
As soon as you meet him in the new year, you'll have to do it.
There's no book in the library in French.
Any dangerous summary, especially that.
You could have stayed in Boston.
There's no one there.
Can you write this to the surgeon, please?
We don't think it matters.
No one understands you as much as I do.
Take your age, then.
Do you know how to jog?
Did you kill your wife?
We exchanged greetings.
Tom still wants to come.
I thought they weren't coming.
I don't bear the kind of animal suffering.
I think Tatoeba's stopping today.
Sally had her brother clean the toilet.
Mary's apartment is full of mess.
The conference room is now busy.
The potato chips are harmful to your health.
Mine's not as good as yours.
I look forward to Christmas.
I've never seen you so happy.
He made a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
It's gone.
Do you see the star?
Ask Tom.
Grab the rope!
That's how you used to say it.
Tom says he's not hungry.
It's always been.
Can't we fire her?
The artificial satellite was taken to orbit.
I'm absolutely serious.
Are you sure it's sick?
It's too simple.
What happens to our children if a nuclear war begins?
I told them the bank isn't working.
Tom and I soon became friends.
He has a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
That's why I'm so sorry.
Something to tell me what to do.
Documents on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
Tom didn't tell us what he was so upset about.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I'm not working today.
That's what you said last time.
I know it's better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like that.
There's nothing to hide from you, is there?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The account shall be paid to the first number of next month.
My French terrible.
We need help.
You're scaring her.
For me, Boston is a cold town, not Chicago.
Tom was a victim of a temptation.
I can't talk about a colleague.
Tom lives far away from you?
Why didn't I die?
The fight is over.
I didn't take it.
Tom came here yesterday.
I'd like to leave a message.
You chose not that man.
They took a great risk.
We have a white cat.
Maybe you'll never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home yesterday?
If anyone can do it, Tom.
The meeting was canceled because of typhoon.
Tom was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2013.
On the road, there was a ride with the mules.
Tom speaks French with his grandparents, and his parents speak English.
I don't think Tom's got enough money to buy a ticket.
It was hard to find Tom.
Everybody's dancing!
I live with Tom.
I met them here.
You're not wasting your time.
Your problem is that you don't have enough patience.
Several events marked the appearance of the 20th century.
Stop doing this, Tom.
Tom said he wasn't planning on doing that.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told him to come to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said there can't be any talking about it.
He got out of bed.
Trains shall be in accordance with the schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think it's impossible not to get confused in languages.
Why is Tom avoiding me?
Is the exam going to be today?
What motivates you?
He gave Lee his computer to himself.
Swallow your arm.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom will agree to meet us?
They say anyone in America can be president, but it probably isn't.
Tom never forgot Mary.
The first one on the list is Tom.
What else have you missed?
Mary tried to calm down.
How long is the train coming?
How long does this train go to Boston?
Didn't you see that?
I need you to call me.
Tom never suspected that Mary and John were dating each other.
When I get rich, I'll buy a farm.
I burned his liver.
It's the neighbouring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You won't believe Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think.
Take this to French, please.
Take the ice cream!
She needs a cab.
The crowd has grown rapidly.
Mary told me she loved me.
Tom told me what happened.
Bones and rubs.
I'll find her.
Did you think about what I said?
I'm very cold.
We're looking for you!
She loves everyone.
Compare your answers to Tom's.
In Tom's weak heart.
So she'll have to pay for it.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me a carnival knife?
Tom took off his heavy beard.
Did you see my dog?
Don't even try to do this on your own.
Nobody saw you take it.
I'm half Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix it.
You have to come back.
We've already spoken.
I can't believe I finally did it.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry!
Why don't you just tell me?
What is the thirteenth month?
I don't know what book to choose.
Tom didn't understand anything at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white boy's wallet.
It's a garden.
I'll have to wait.
Yesterday was Sunday, not Saturday.
Is anyone here with them?
They're watching you.
How much time do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
We can do that.
He knows his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary wears a black coat.
We had dinner at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks for help.
Tom didn't say that, Mary.
It's okay.
There's a lot of prospects in this city.
What are you wearing?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to get married next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't said that yet, have you?
She's got a double chin.
We can't force people to do this.
Let me take it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't stand that color.
They sleep together?
We're very grateful for that.
He can't believe he's not married yet.
I didn't even know you knew.
I won't let her in.
Our neighbors complained about us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot the bear.
I never talked to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust that.
She's in a lot of trouble.
I wonder why that's why it's necessary.
That seems suspicious to me.
I'll make it look like you didn't say that.
What are you doing on Friday night?
Tom's not the only one in Boston.
Will you hold on to me?
Why don't you like this plan?
I thought you were at work.
That's what you have to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
Is it you or the enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter's about to end.
Titles and rewards don't mean anything to me.
Where did you even find him?
The meeting is delayed.
I'll meet you.
Have you had a good weekend?
Tom's drinking beer.
You don't want to do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is that good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need cash.
So bring me a drink.
What do you want to eat at these exits?
Get up!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She laughed at me.
He's afraid we're going astray.
I can't call him home.
You should have apologized to Tom for his rude behavior.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy ran to his home.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a cab driver when he lived in Boston.
Tom seems to be an optimist.
He's not buying a camera.
I did everything I could to help him.
I'm joining you with her.
She received the highest scores.
Tom can explode.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color do you have in your childhood?
I'm out of here in a hurry.
I work for the welfare of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do that.
I was a little scared.
Tom took advantage of the domkraut.
I'd like to come.
You owe me a note or something.
I want to relax in front of the TV tonight, and I don't want to get out of the house.
He'll be here today.
I'm dying.
Now only half the ninth?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
It's safe to swim in this lake.
I cut my finger yesterday.
Tom wanted to have dinner with me today.
Tom doesn't look very good.
She put herself on her hands to warm them up.
Tom said he was glad you came back.
My car's covered in blue shit.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Lori's home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I'm not gonna make that mistake anymore.
I don't care whether we stay or not.
I agreed to marry her.
I've been waiting my whole life this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane went into a trap.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any friends on the census in Indonesia?
You may need to help her.
Mary lost consciousness.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come with me to the concert?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had the time, I'd be happy to let you know.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your Zones?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hello," said Tom.
Where are you?
I didn't hear you die yesterday.
I've got it all wrong.
She had no food.
I don't think Tom knows how much time.
They're running away.
The road does not match the number of cars passing through it.
You seem to be afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the price.
You don't have to come to the congregation.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new proposal as a message in a bottle: they will ever transfer it.
You won't find work here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
They all loved you.
We're relatives with him.
I have a granddaughter of your age.
I'm sorry I took your party out.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I never worked with her.
She started to grow up in her new office.
Let's take care of it.
I think you're sitting in my place.
I planned to do this yesterday.
Now a couple of people are getting drunk, aren't they?
My parents don't like my manner of dress.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
That'll be interesting.
I hit him with a hammer and I hit him hard.
Because, worse?
It's not worth it.
Can I take your hand?
He's green.
Tom heard the noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom didn't lie all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about a cellulite.
The series needs to start watching when all seasons are off!
Road accidents occur every day.
Where'd you guys go to go to the buns?
You've been to the parsichmacher?
It's a fascinating prospect.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the handkerchief.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept for two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this situation.
Get out of here.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's take a picture together.
I failed the exam.
They've already known about it.
You'd better go help her.
The footballer made a huge mistake.
They're coming, too?
She sleeps like a baby.
Tom forgot to let go of the brake.
This song reminds me of one girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
Blow up the whole building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they got married.
It's my cat.
Do you already have children?
Tom didn't want to have breakfast.
They like it.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is a hopeful idiot.
It doesn't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I think you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let go of the cat.
I know you're all rabbits.
Tom thinks it's a sin to throw out the products.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place disappears to the right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I have no doubt.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom the pot of whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's reacting.
I've never met him before.
How much was he worth?
I need to see you right away.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
The sharks eat fish.
I'm the same as I was before.
Do you know the boy who's crying?
Nobody knew about that.
It's just amazing.
He said he'd never do that.
The stolen bee steals the cow.
Tom's not swimming very well, is he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was just a bit of an ex-boyfriend.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to come with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
It's all over.
What day is it today?
So let's give it another chance.
I just want you to take me as I do.
I'm a regular guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily in the mouth?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't say he'd come with us.
Tom died the day after.
Tom and I have to stick together.
I've only heard good about him.
I don't work here anymore.
Which one do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You're not going to compare with us.
I saw the car exploded.
Window here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never throw out my Plaston.
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
Stay calm!
What's your favorite TV show?
You want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Chemodan Tom is empty.
Oh, my God!
I'm afraid you're going to lose.
I like to go to school.
I offered to help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son for me.
Looks like her father's a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
Your dog.
What do you mean?
You can't do anything about it.
Tell me because I'm going to go home to him today.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Don't you see what happened?
I didn't want to worry about him.
The officer took courage from his men.
Tom will never find her.
In any case, I'm thinking about trying things like that.
I don't understand much about hunting.
For the first time, I'm going to make a home of meat on a grill.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would have apologized to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many zonettes do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
It's all known.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom's gonna pay for it.
Mom, look what I found.
It's interesting what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I never met Tom.
Maybe she said that.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw him look at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom must be home.
She was the one I was thinking about.
Tom showed the police his driving rights.
I sneez every month.
I told you I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to release them.
It's apple acid.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new directory.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
Are you working at home?
According to mythology, Prometheus had taken the sacred fire from the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All the passengers were able to get out of the bus before he got burned.
I want to help you understand that.
You speak French better than me.
There are many talented people in our city, but Tom doesn't care about them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your own best game.
We're taking checks.
My bike's gone.
The stars died in the night sky.

We don't know why and Mary.
I want to be happy.
You're going to lose.
We've seen it before.
How many legs did you buy?
We never leave hope.
What happened to the book I put here yesterday?
Don't even talk about the price, it's not my salary.
I want to know who started it.
I didn't think they'd punish me.
Write it as a quarantine.
We didn't build it.
You'd better go help him.
Is that right?
Tomorrow morning they're selling tickets to the Shakira concert.
It was better today.
I know Tom's a brave man.
I got married early.
It's not a bitch.
I don't want to scare you.
Tom told me Mary wouldn't want to go.
Have you talked to the doctors yet?
No one's seen this.
Mary is an outstanding artist.
I think he's right.
Everybody likes money.
They went astray in the woods.
When was the last time you ate?
My heart hurts.
My father won't let me go to a movie.
I saw a ton boat.
Instead of going to work, I spent the whole day at home.
I'll back you up.
I didn't talk to Tom.
They decided to work harder.
It's not sold.
Who's your neighbor?
My father usually watches the TV after dinner.
He's drinking wine.
Please cut yourself a apple pie, I've prepared it for you.
I don't think Tom understood the question.
You have to stop her.
You'll make it if you leave now.
There was no special problem with Tom.
The darkness didn't hide it.
I invited him to dinner.
I'm sure it'll be easy to find a place.
I took two aspirin pills from the main pain.
You're in my heart.
He took me to the last dig.
Don't laugh!
Love doesn't obey anyone.
If you come to that right now, you'll probably stop watching it.
I saw you in the park with Tom.
I didn't mean to hurt them.
I'd better go find them.
My motorcycle broke down on the road.
Tom made himself without a shirt.
In what kingdom was this church built?
We'll be able to put you in jail soon.
I'm starting to think you're serious.
I'm not coming back anymore.
I'm sure Tom would like to help.
It's Joanna.
I made so many mistakes.
How can people do such things?
That's why I'm really sorry.
I like your eyes.
The rainwater's coming through that tube.
I've always considered Tom a close friend.
I'm one of those girls who's more friends with guys.
Don't worry, I have insurance.
Tom will be here with me.
My father has a hard time letting go of drinking.
Nobody's suggesting you do this.
He works in this company from Monday to Sunday.
Mary forgot to shut the car down.
I'm old.
Tom left with Mary.
Tom started laughing.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Tom has telepathic skills.
Who is he by nationality?
Tom was sitting with John in one of the cameras.
I didn't want to swim.
He drank beer.
In our time, it's harder for a man to be... alone.
I'll never talk to him again.
Sh-sh, Tom, wake up!
I'm squeezing my nose plates.
I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm a new teacher.
They're all children.
She left and yelled at me.
Have you taken your medicine?
The rabbits are very nice.
She doesn't trust him.
Time on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Is there something you wanted to tell me?
I doubt Tom's still mad.
You'll be better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you feel the smell of burning resin?
It didn't happen here.
When will your father come home?
I understand.
Tom passed Mary's book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of my mind.
In Tom's patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom's trying to escape.
You're obviously tired.
We're champions.
Tom's glaucoma.
Tom said it wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring the salad to the party.
Her hair is wet from the sweat.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat in the middle between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much it's worth?
The pilot is the master of compliments.
Tom is Mary's wife, isn't he?
All the rocks in the park were busy.
Someone needs to tell her that.
I've got it all working.
Vermont is on the border with Canada.
He had to live in one room with his brother.
I didn't imbecile.
You're doing it, aren't you?
I can't hunt.
He has a brother in Tokyo.
Dynamite invented Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We need to get involved.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can come up if you want.
I know you don't have to do this.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my eyes.
I've already spoken to this student.
What is the chemical sign of bromoic acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in the haystack.
I asked Tom.
So we need to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do that.
The key!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a courtroom.
I respect his views, even though he disagrees with many of them.
Neboskrabh is in the center of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied him up with a sweater.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine, call the money?
You don't have to go.
Put it in the middle.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her not.
He didn't say anything.
They don't like you, do they?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
You've been planning on staying for a long time?
We're in a hurry and we're out of here.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're straight.
Careful, don't mess up anything on your feet.
Start each meal with soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you call him at all?
He didn't stop the car.
He was sitting right opposite me.
The calibre was opened.
It's my fault.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day at school.
I want to meet you before I die.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I suggest another strategy?
They're dead.
Big apples.
You didn't know Tom was living in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
Is she a poet?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Tom?
Let's go to the car.
You're messing with me.
She wondered what his lips would taste like.
Good coach is training this team.
The tree hurts.
The train was stopped because of a strong snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
Why did you take that I didn't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him he was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It must have been you.
Mary left me a hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Are you living there?
What would you eat?
You don't know her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning to do it or not.
I'm falling.
I wasn't able to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom's wearing a new shoe.
Last year she learned to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
I don't have to thank you.
Since it was winter, he didn't go out the street.
I'm going down the street, I've seen my friend.
How many houses on your street?
The elephants are made of ivory.
I'm not a kid anymore.
"What's life, Mike?" "My name's Tom."
Her native language is French.
It's a pretty weird coat.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married then.
I bought this book.
Naïveness is its only positive quality.
My hobby is collecting insects.
Tom's baby lived in Boston.
I haven't eaten for six days.
Can I tell them about this?
She's been quiet all day.
It doesn't matter what he can say, don't believe him.
I'm on my way.
Tom and Mary hope their next child will be a boy.
Mary is always very friendly, and she has a nice smile.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures, babies fall asleep under blankets.
It's the best restaurant I know.
You could know a lot of them if you just listened.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
I'm sorry I upset you.
The one who never left his country is a lot of prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when snow falls.
Tom's helping his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I've turned on the imagination.
I thought we could do that.
My mom was against me driving alone.
I'm sorry, I didn't get it.
You know what you're doing, right?
You can't trust the car transfer.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
In this river full of fish.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
We're partners with her.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms?
Locked free.
What, they said, did it happen?
You couldn't leave the door open?
That's what we're gonna have to wait for.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice my age.
Tom knows they made a mistake.
In Japan, it's a soft climate.
Check again.
Don't condemn Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
That's why I didn't let him do what he wanted.
He replaced the traumatized game.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our trip was very smooth.
It's inevitable that one day I'm going to France, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom's only getting sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
You can open the window again.
It's never been like this with me before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was going to leave when I called.
I don't have to endure this.
Always take the road between the right and the left.
We're asked to be presented in turn.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
Maybe she's nice, but I don't like her.
I can let you go if you want.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
Do you still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes like a hot tub.
I really don't have that much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about that.
You don't have to regret it.
She's my mistress!
The sound of your voice like a melodic song is for me.
What kind of marriage?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why Mary didn't like it.
My fingers left on the fingerprints.
Chemistry is a remarkable science.
I feel like my French isn't getting much better.
How can I best get a passport?
Maybe you're able to help, that's why.
Tom is the best drummer I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom didn't pay attention to Mary all day.
Tom's got fat hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell a house, but he doesn't have a choice.
Find more light.
I gave my sister a speech.
It's my father's car, but she'll be mine soon.
Did you forget his name?
If I had the time to do this, I would.
Do you see Tom's boat?
Famous?
This medicine will help you.
Stop the noise.
I'm sick of my life.
Do you know how I was busy?
Tom's busy.
I can trust someone.
She's a big-town sex fan.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Talk to him well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do that?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
Christ works, stop it!
Nothing compares to a glass of beer after a long working day.
What happened?
Tom left his bag.
Here are a few interesting facts.
How much time do you need?
Let's move over here.
You're in new boots?
You can leave if you want.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
That's what my mom said.
She spooked the makeup when she saw the dog.
He's not above me at all.
Smoking is strictly forbidden.
That Persian is beautiful.
Do you see?
That's not a big deal.
You shouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place.
Good job!
You used to say that yourself.
Here's a few letters for you.
It is practically unimaginable that a scientist would have made such a fundamental mistake.
He has no evidence.
You look bad.
He was a very good swimmer when he was young.
I'm writing to a friend.
He's very good at tennis.
She put the students in error.
She said she was Canadian.
Don't talk to anyone.
And when were you going to tell me?
I didn't want to tell you that.
I filled the bowl up to the top.
Go straight.
I'm too tired to think about it right now.
Where do you live?
I told them it wasn't nice.
What do we live for?
Is it gonna rain today?
We know about her.
You could have helped us.
I drive a car a lot.
That's why I don't like the movie.
Just get in there.
Just ask him to forgive me.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I'm two of you.
I didn't know it was legal.
I love adventures.
Tom's in the library.
Did you go to school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I didn't know.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Are you good enough?
I decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.
Tomorrow's gonna be a big snowfall.
We decided to move the meeting to the next Sunday.
She thinks she can prove it.
When was the last time you played golf?
Are we poor?
I don't know the name Tom.
We have the same dentist.
Not all Brazilians like carnival.
I don't think Tom knows what's going on.
To whom did Tom sell his car?
Tom's moaning.
I have to make money to buy a computer.
Don't laugh at strangers.
I don't know them.
If you could choose genes for your children, would they?
So Mary and I have to rest.
It's easy to sleep.
It could have been worse.
Tom did his part.
Tom doesn't know where Mary's keys are.
What book are you looking for?
I'm sleeping a little.
You'll get there sometime.
Tom's fine with Mary.
"You have to pay me." "No, you don't."
He walked up and stood on his knees.
You don't have to go there if you don't want to.
This song always reminds me of my childhood.
Tom did this for you?
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
He says he's rich.
Tom works three times more than Mary.
I drank milk.
It'll snow tomorrow.
Isn't life remarkable?
When it comes to getting ready, no one compares with Mary.
You haven't been yourself lately.
Tom lost his leg when he attacked the shark.
I burned it for you.
We'll do it as soon as we can.
Next year, I'll be three times your senior.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your stamp collection.
It'll take forever.
Tom's quite unknown to Mary.
He looks like no one knows.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?
This tissue fits your skin.
I fell in love with you.
It's almost winter.
I think Tom lied to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to.
Tom and I were wondering.
I'm fine.
Tom decided to give up his professional guitar game.
I'm married now.
It was just a couple of times.
This time you've gone too far.
It's working.
Are you going to see Tom before you leave?
No wonder, Tom answered.
We want to take the apartment out of town.
They spoke more French.
It's extremely expensive.
He's no longer a poet.
I didn't know what else to do.
They haven't woken up yet.
Tom for a couple of inches above Mary.
I'm glad you suggested that.
Your question is hard to answer.
You don't believe her?
English is the world language.
Sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I'm just saying 'cause he's gonna leave Mary alone.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's looking for a job.
So why do you need milk?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of the dark.
The situation is getting worse.
I choose where to taste.
Tom decided to buy a supported car instead of a new one.
I just wanted to wish you good luck.
She's separated.
I won't let you take my kids.
Don't give it to him.
Run, and they'll arrest you.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom made the habit of meditating every morning.
Have you checked your bills?
He tried to make a short story.
A bookless room, like a body without a soul.
Why did God hurt us so much?
What's your brother doing?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure it won't happen again?
I haven't seen you in a hundred years.
I called Tony yesterday.
It's easy to make an impression on her.
You're old enough to do this on your own.
Aristotene believed that the Earth was the center of the universe.
It's interesting that Tom actually meant it.
No one understands me.
There's so many stars in the sky, I can't read them.
They all came back and looked at us.
Let me see.
White bears live in the Arctic.
I told you I was the best of all.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.
Tom doesn't have to ask you to do something a few times.
Let the dish be washed today by the one who loses his wallet.
How unhappy I am!
I would never do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?
He said Russian — at least, he told me.
Tom's a third grader.
Will you stay long?
I'm not a woman.
She's got a tall father.
The train was overrun.
The house is red.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
You don't know Boston, do you?
The orchestra started playing.
Mary was wearing a pirate suit.
It's not my wife.
Why didn't you mention it earlier?
Tom didn't want to be a knocker.
He was born at seven a.m. on 5 June 1970.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
Jane and Kate are twins.
Tom is only white meat.
Thank you for helping.
We only have three rules.
She bought one of herself.
Security didn't see Tom.
In recent years, Tom has made a remarkable observation.
I helped carry those bags.
They have plenty of time.
Fifteen to five is equal to seventy-five.
I live in this hotel.
I don't want to know anything anymore.
You still don't know what he's gonna say.
My hands are up.
I've been cheating on my wife all the time.
Finally, she did it.
It's a ghastly nonsense that they weren't insured from the fire.
We've got a lot of money.
The examination was split into two parts.
When are you gonna tell them?
Tom didn't want to talk about his illness.
Hey, you're so bored here!
Let's compare book reading to travel.
Tom saw Mary come into the store.
Why aren't you there?
Tom said Mary would probably win.
The Japanese would never do that.
I don't care so much about Boston.
She writes letters all the time.
I don't know who to consult.
Turn left at the corner.
Tom taught me to do it.
We can do a lot more.
Give me one, please.
I'm not bringing up the disobedient children.
That's what Tom bought me.
What you said, everybody was upset.
You're too small for that.
My parents have been married for 30 years.
She demonstrated her talents.
I wish that was possible.
I guess you can't do that.
I'm lucky I'm alive.
Bob will be the first to play a major role at the next school festival.
You must remain in shape.
I've been sucking seeds all day.
I realized he was an American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Forgive me!
Tom has submitted.
All the people of my generation think about it the same way.
I live for it.
Do you have the ability to jump on the spoons?
Duke reigns in many lands.
Well, they're having fun.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad's getting better.
You'll feel at home.
It's not gonna end well!
He looked like he didn't eat for a few days.
I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who's Norman Finkelstein?" "American Politologist."
Get out of here!
If it's not selling goods at home, maybe it's a new way to get to know girls?
Tom improved the coin.
Why didn't you get out of your room?
If there is no God, it's all allowed.
We're both called Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're in time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please stretch the belts during take-off and landing.
That's why and Mary.
We both love seafood.
I've waited a long time.
I rejected the offer.
You want to come with us?
Tom didn't.
I'm going to have too much time to explain why it doesn't work.
Nothing's changed.
Did you build all of this yourself?
I look forward to the summer vacation.
Can we make this a different one?
That's where he looks.
The house - to - house buildings are easily lit.
So let's celebrate the party.
Dog's still alive.
I'm going to college.
I know you lied.
Keeping it very comfortable.
I'll report this tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's a bitch.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait here for him to come.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoes.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was scheduled on Tuesday.
My name is Jose.
You forgot to mention that.
We don't need that anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do this without our help.
It's all ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who arranged a meeting?
I'm such a bad guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not going to have fun tonight.
Mary was the only girl in the jungle.
What bird can't fly?
That's what we need to put an end to.
Tom didn't answer right away.
Tom died in his 70s.
Life is a gift.
Tom also speaks more French.
The invention of the transistor marked a new era.
I'm not in love with Mary.
Did you hear what she said about Alexie?
You look like a girl.
Here's a few photos.
What's going on the tenth channel?
I hate spinach.
Mother's getting ready for dinner.
Tom is a fireman.
What can I do?
Her genius son.
I know you've seen terrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He's willing to give in to emotion.
We were shocked by the news of his death.
Why didn't they go?
I didn't see you.
You're just noticing the obvious.
He had cancer.
You're the one responsible for what happened.
It's like hours.
I know where you're going.
You're taking it all for a flight.
Let's get him out of here.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.
I don't like doing this.
The janitor stopped the conversation.
On the writing table, the cat.
I don't want to be late for work.
You're not getting any more cream.
Tom was a busy chicken.
Tom gave me a ring.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to the weather.
I wonder who's gonna help him get a snowflake?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in family souls?
What's that noise?
My son has inherited a disease.
That's disgusting.
Is it snow?
I'll call you back.
He dropped the glass.
I don't know if there's a country where you can marry your dog.
Better protection is an attack.
She's getting married this autumn.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it'd be easy.
Can we help you?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When are you ready to go?
The investigations began last year with the confiscation of human computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
How's life?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What did you decide you couldn't do?
We drove back through Boston.
Who will believe that?
Thank you for the correction.
She's out of her mind?
The stars appear at night.
Where did Tom take this scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom's on his plate.
Tom can't ride a bike.
I'm not talking at all.
Why did Tom leave?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild beasts.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed at tears.
I spent $500 a day.
Tell them to go home.
That's where it's good to be.
They didn't make it in time.
Now seven thirty.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who said that.
Tom got up early to see the light.
The dinosaurs died a long time ago.
I usually get up one by one.
Tom's got another year.
I'm around the station.
Tom's a very good boy.
Are you drinking?
Are you from Boston?
Put it on my desk.
Tom got out of the water.
I was so proud of it.
You were ready.
Do you know Brother Tom?
All oats can lay eggs.
You'll pay for what you did.
I'm out of my hands today.
I asked them to stay away from this.
He only learned to drive in 30.
I'm glad he didn't get hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed in a long time.
The kitchen knife was not strong enough to cut meat, so I took advantage of my perch knife.
Honey, I can explain everything.
You'll soon be able to adapt to the village life.
Keep some air with water.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We're all set.
The river is deep.
Thank you very much.
I told you that a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
I guess you should say that.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed.
Writing words separately in cases where they are to be written in the same language is a major problem in Norwegian.
What are you doing with the leftovers?
It's been ten years since her death.
Tom met Mary a year ago.
Do you need anything else?
We left soon after that.
This book must be read.
Tom and Mary made lessons for dinner.
I don't want to drink your tea.

Tom's life is not sugar.
My mom always loved me.
Be careful if you go somewhere.
If you don't need it, don't buy it.
Tom saved the sinking man.
That's a question that we've been asked quite often.
If she knew his phone number, she could call him.
You're a Czech, aren't you?
You said you'd come.
Give me my clothes.
Where can we get the boat?
I think I've never seen them before.

Unfortunately, you can't just take it and leave.
You'll know tomorrow.
Tom's lying in this grave.
Who doesn't know what to do here?
You can do this in one or two days.
Let's wait till tomorrow.
I think I know your name.
Oh, my God, what did I do?
Give me my clothes.
The doctors did what they could.
Can you catch the fish?
Who are you going to sell this to?
I think I heard someone opening the window.
Maybe Tom just forgot to do it.
If he knew his phone, he could call him.
Who are you selling this to?
Tom came back to ask for money.
Tom's gonna be with you until I get back.
Who took your passport?
That won't stop them.
It was very serious.
Tom's letter is better than Mary's.
Can I get you some milk for tea?
Did you tell anyone about this?
Guess who's the letter from.
What kind of prefecture are you?

Stop bitein' me.
What Tom did can't be changed.
You'll tell me later?
There's no forest here.
Okay, it's time to go.
We have a meeting with the director.
You'll have to do it, even if you don't want to.
Who here can't do that?
It's time to learn German.
How long have you and Tom been on the beach?
You don't like your name?
Tom is afraid of it the most.
Tell me because he shouldn't do it.
No one can do this better, Tom.
There's someone in your room.
Let's talk about it now!
I hate advertising.
You're being tortured again?
I suggest you get on the bus.
You should not do so without permission.
You just have to wait.
Are you really scared?
Tom didn't look sad at all.
Did you understand anything about what Tom said?
We're not planning on doing this anymore.

I'm ready, aren't you?
Deep ocean layers have not yet been studied.
In an hour, we'll all be asleep.

Do all birds have a clown?
Do it now.
Maybe that's what we all should do.
Have you seen Tom since?
Sometimes I read the newspaper.
Why are you living with Tom?
At the end of the day, I decided not to offer myself up for this job.
He likes to go to parties.

I'm very sad about that.
No one would do that in a healthy way.
My son's too thin.

Tom's waiting for you there.
I hope you understand.
I would have done the same for you.
Tom slept until noon.
At some point, Tom has to leave.

I want everyone to envy me.
Tom said he wanted to stay in bed.
Tom's leaving as soon as he can.

In adults, both eyes are on one side of the body.
