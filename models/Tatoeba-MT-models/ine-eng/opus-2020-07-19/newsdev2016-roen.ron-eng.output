Former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet is brought before the court
On Tuesday, a federal judge accepted the charges brought against the former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet for its alleged involvement in a massive corruption scheme on Petrobras state oil company.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office said Jose Dirceu will be sent to court for charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering brought this month.
Other 12 persons will be judged, including Joao Vaccari Neto, former treasurer of the Workers Party, located in power in Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duque, former president of Petrobras business services.
Dirceu is the oldest member of the Party of Workers in custody for relations with this scheme.
Dirceu served as the head of the former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested at the beginning of August of his home, where he was already under arrest at home, with an 11-year sentence for involvement in a vote purchase scheme in Congress over 10 years ago.
The prosecutors said that Dirku developed the petrobras bribe scheme, accepted bribes while it was in operation and continued to receive payments from entrepreneurs after it was closed at the end of 2013 for the scandal of the purchased votes.
According to prosecutors, the Petrobras scheme involved approximately $2 billion in bribery and other illegal funds.
Part of that money would have returned to the campaign fund of the ruling party and their allies.
It would also include bribed to directors of Petrobras in exchange for covered contracts.
Recovery of a "miraculous" surviving student of the Peshawar massacre
A paralysed teenager after being shot four times in the most complete terrorist attack in Pakistan succeeded in a "miraculous" recovery after being treated in the United Kingdom.
Mohammed Ibrahim Khan, 13 years of age, the doctors in Pakistan told him that he would never be able to walk again.
At least 140 people, most children, were killed when armed men attacked the public school of the Peshawar army last December.
Mohamed, who arrived in London last month for surgery, will be removed later from the hospital.
Just nine months ago, in a usual morning of Tuesday, Mohamed stood at the time of first aid and listened carefully to the teachers.
Even then, seven armed men dressed in uniforms of security agents entering the army's public school.
They had to carry out a simple mission: killing all the men, women and children who were getting in the way.
"I can't forget what happened that day," says Mohamed with a quick look.
I was sitting in the amphitheatre, asking questions... then I heard gunshots outside.
Terrorists entered and began to kill. Our professor was burned alive.
Mohamed describes how four students got out of the amphitheatre while the carnage took place.
Then he says he heard his friend, Hamza, shouting him.
He said, "oh, brother, save me."
I held him by the hand.
Then I was shot in the back, and he in the head.
Most of those killed in the attack were students
Hamza died in Mohammed's arms.
Mohamed remembers that immediately after that he lay down and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the door down.
Peshawar doctors from northern Pakistan, then Rawalpindi, near the capital, told his family that there was no treatment and that he would never be able to go again.
"When I saw him, I felt my soul coming out," says Sher Khan, Mohamed's father.
Those nine months were the hardest of my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son so passionate of cricket would never be able to use his legs again.
They made a campaign and asked for help from Pakistan's television, attracting the support of famous people such as Imran Khan, a political cricket player.
Eventually, they managed to raise funds to take Mohamed to the United Kingdom and provide treatment to the private Harley Street clinic in London.
The neurosurgeon consultant Irfan Malik described Mohamed as "intimacy" when she arrived at the hospital.
"They spent the last [some] months sleeping in bed, without being able to move from one side to the other," says Malik.
He was weak, he put a lot of pressure on his back.
She wasn't in a very good shape.
A vertebrate from Mohammed's vertebral column was destroyed
Mohamed was shot in the shoulder, in the shoulder and back during the attack, and the lower spine was destroyed, leading to paralysis.
During a six-hour operation, however, Malik and his team were able to relegate the nervous endings and rebuild the destroyed part of the column.
Even Malik was surprised by what happened next.
Just one week after the operation, Mohamed got up and started taking steps and walking.
We didn't expect such a good result.
It was a miracle," he says.
In less than two weeks since the operation, Mohamed is ready to leave the hospital and start the long recovery process.
Mohamed challenged the fate and began to go again
He wants to become strong and continue his studies in the United Kingdom.
However, it is decided to return to Pakistan, join the army and fight terrorism.
"I feel I still have a chance to live," he says, showing the images with weapons drawn by him next to school manuals and styles
Physically, Mohamed becomes ever stronger every day, but the psychological trauma that passes through and now is unimaginable.
"My anger hasn't gone down," he confesses.
In my school, small children were killed.
What crime did they commit?
His mother wipes out a tear, hugs him up and says, "I see my son walking again."
He can keep his life fresh.
The 4G "Super Voice" service from Three offers a better signal
Three uses a 4G spectrum with a lower frequency, which can cover a wider area
Mobile telephony provider Three launched a service in the United Kingdom that says it will improve reception within buildings and rural areas without a signal.
The 4G Super Voice service allows customers to make calls and send text messages using a spectrum with a lower frequency.
And other networks intend to introduce the same technology, known as "Voice Over Long-Term Evolution (VolTE)".
This only works with Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone phones will benefit from it in the coming months.
Three points out that up to 5.5 million customers will have access to service by 2017.
The chief in charge of technology, Bryn Jones, said: “By the end of the year, a million of our clients will have access to better indoor coverage and will be able to use their phones in more places than ever.”
The stars prepare for the pantomime train
The pantomime station is very important for the theatres throughout the United Kingdom, many of which are preparing for the stadium this year.
Now, at Christmas theater, some of the biggest names in the show business participate.
Matthew Kelly and Hayley Mills will appear in the Censorship - the first in the role of one of the bad sisters, and the second in the role of the bridegroom.
They reveal the secrets of their pantomime at BBC Breakfast.
Steven Wilson: "If I don't do anything, I feel guilty."
Steven Wilson was recently nominated as the great winner of the Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson was often called the most successful musician in the progressive rock world.
The musical talent won three awards at Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, including the best album of the year for Hand.
In its five-star review, The Guardian called the album "an intelligent, expressive and captivating work".
Since 1980, Wilson has been the engine of most music projects, the most famous of them being the Porcupine Tree rock band.
Now, before two shows with the house closed at Royal Albert Hall, Wilson launches a double LP only in vinyl format, Transition, to show the "more accessible" width of his solo activity.
He told the BBC about his love for vinyls and his programme loaded and explained how the comedy actor Matt Berry had come to open his shows.
What does vinyl mean to you?
I grew up even in the end of the vinyl era, and I remember that we were just waiting for the CD to appear, because the vinyl was so annoying.
You bought a disk, you went home with him, you had a scratch and you had to bring him back.
I love the CDs, and for certain types of music, for example, the classics, they're better than the vinyls.
But the problem with CDs and digital downloads is that there is nothing more to really appreciate.
Having a vinyl is like having a nice picture hung in the sink.
It's something you can hold in your hand, while you're letting yourself be absorbed by verses and covered by the artistic act.
I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but it doesn't have a way of being so if some kids too young to remember their vinyls like this kind of experience.
Do you have any vinyl that you especially care about?
I admit we got rid of all the vinyls in the '90s.
All the vinyls we've bought again.
I started with the idea of re-establishing the collection that I was 15 years old, but I passed that limit.
The first disk I convinced my parents to buy was out of the Blue from the Electric Light Orchestra.
If I had still the original copy, it would have had sentimental value, but unfortunately it is somewhere through a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes that the album will be a gateway to possible new fans
Why did you launch your new Transition compilation on vinyl?
This was originally conceived as an idea for the day of the speech stores, but I missed the opportunity.
My house of speeches suggested to gather a few of my shortest and most accessible songs.
I came to be easily obsessed with the idea of doing some sort of "introduction into Steven Wilson's music" and I kept the project intact so that it would only be released on vinyl.
Who buys the vinyl also receives a variant downloaded to the high resolution.
Are you worried that the album will not show your music in its true light?
No, because, although I focus on longer music plays, there's something I've always appreciated more than anything: the melodic part.
There is a lot of progressive rock that focuses rather on technical complexity than on the melodic side.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock band of all time, passed the time test because they always put the emphasis on the melodic side and the atmosphere.
What are you doing for Albert Hall's shows?
I don't want you to reveal too much.
The repertoire will be completely different in each of the nights.
First, it's going to be a version of the show Hand. Wase. I had this year, but on steroids, with a few guests.
The second night there's going to be an incursion into my history, and it's being more directed to fans who have been following me for years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to open your show on the second night?
And me and the rest of the tour team are big fans of the [channel 4 comedy series] Toast of London, until we give it all the time.
I also thought about listening to Matt's music, so I bought his album, Music for Insomniacs.
I talked to him about our common love for Mike Oldfield and I asked him to sing at the Royal Albert Hall.
I think I'm extremely lucky to have him in the open.
You have released albums from such groups as XTC, Ters for Fears and Yes.
How much does that affect your own music?
I am not consciously inspired by this, however, inevitably, when you deconstruct these classic albums, they remain in your mind.
My last solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was undoubtedly the most progressive old school album I ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that we were returning King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all the previous year.
The current album, Hand. Wase., is much more open, because we were working at Ters for Fears and XTC.
You are often described as the most busy progressive rock musician.
Is that how you feel?
You can delete the word progressive.
I think I'm probably one of the most obsessed people in today's music world and I'm not saying that with pride, because, please believe me, it's a curse.
I think I inherited this from my father, who has an ethics of incredibly strong work.
If I don't do anything all day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That's why work on remix was a gift, because it means I don't have to do my music all the time.
The music industry is a hard place to make a career.
Now I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a profession.
I work daily and I'm not rich, but I live well.
I love what I do, it's a privilege, but if I were lazy, I don't think I'd survive.
Transition will be launched in the United Kingdom on 25 September.
Steven Wilson will sing at Royal Albert Hall on 28 and 29 September, as part of his European tour 2015-2016.
A new contract brings jobs back to Skytrans
The new Skytrans reorganized part of the airline's staff who lost their job when the old Skytrans went into bankruptcy.
Skytrans, a company redeployed from northern Queensland, has awarded a $25 million contract to transport the employees of the QGC natural gas company, which meant that 18 crew members have recovered their jobs.
Skytrans, a company owned by the Wild family, became very active in January, after the Newman government rewarded the subsidised routes that constituted a large part of the airline's business.
The complaint led to several communities facing a potential isolation, and Warren Entsch, a national-liberal parliament for northern Queensland, was the representative voice of the criticisms of the national-liberal government.
Another company, Collins Aircraft Holdings, relaunched Skytrans brand in March.
Michael Thine, Executive Director of Skytrans, said that the airline contract with QCG has already created jobs.
"We managed to redeploy 18 members of Skytrans staff with the full standard, as pilots and crew members," he said.
We are also pleased to have a new staff, with direct logistics experience in managing flight operations for QGC clients.
In just five months, we got 100% of our workforce, 78 staff members being employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract aims to extend Skytrans's flight operations from its central headquarters in Cairns, which serves Cape York and Stramester Torres, and to include a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 return flights a week for the staff of QGC and for the entrepreneurs in Brisbane to locations in Chinchilla and Tarroom, in its Dash-8 flights from 36 locations, starting on Monday, October 26.
Tony Nunan, the executive director of the QGC, said that Skytrans received the contract following a tender procedure.
"We are pleased that this contract will contribute to the expansion of a company in Queensland," he said.
The Skytrans contract maintains high-quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.
Liberal parliament and fresh mother Kelly O'Dwyer gets the advice to make a bigger supply of milk to avoid ratting votes in the Chamber
Looks like more women will be in the office.
Malcolm Turnbull's new government will be invested on Mondays and there are strong signs that more women will occupy the portfolios.
One of the leaders of the government, Kelly O'Dwyer, has been advised to make a larger supply of milk for her newborn to prevent breast-feeding from taking part in her duties in Parliament.
The advice comes from the government's supervisor, Scott Buchholz, who later consulted his Labourist counterpart to find out what is the most appropriate approach for a nursing parliamentary, in accordance with the orders in force.
Liberal parliamentary Kelly O'Dwyer with her daughter, Olivia.
In accordance with the orders in force - the set of rules governing the behaviour of parliamentarians in the Chamber - the mothers who breast-feed get a vote power in Parliament.
This means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the Chamber.
But Whip didn't know about this exemption before he consulted the opposition's disciplinary officer, Chris Hayes, on this issue.
Things got worse on two occasions, when O'Dwyer couldn't attend a division meeting and couldn't meet his obligation to give a speech because he just started breast-feeding.
On one of these occasions, her team was asked if the parliamentary was planning to make a larger milk reserve instead of breast-feeding.
Scott Buchholz, the parliamentarian of Queensland, is responsible for the government's discipline.
Later, the two resolved their dispute.
Both refused to comment when they were contacted by Fairfax Media, but separate sources of Buchholz and O'Dwyer said to Fairfax Media that the representative of the Higgins division was angry when he was told to make a larger supply of milk instead of breast-feeding his daughter, Olivia, born in May.
This fact is revealed even when new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull works at the creation of his new cabinet.
Buchholz, the liberal national parliament of Queensland, was promoted as the responsibility for discipline by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, as part of the negative effect of attempting censorship in February of this year.
O'Dwyer, in the picture next to Amanda Rishworth of the Labourist Party and her son Percy, is one of Parliament's three mothers.
The former disciplinary officer, Phillip Ruddock, was removed only a few days after Abbott faced a motion of censorship by which he wanted to be removed from office, being replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Andrew Nickolic, the Liberal of Tasmania, was also promoted and appointed to be responsible for deputy discipline.
Nickolc had recently kept the first page of the papers, after it was discovered that he had sent Turnbull a message asking him to refuse to challenge Abbott's leadership.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after her daughter, Olivia, was born in May.
It's one of the three parliamentarians who became nuns this year.
The spokesman for the Labour Party, Catherine King, said on Wednesday that the voting power for breast-feeding mothers was introduced when her son was a baby.
"Now she's [seven years old]," she wrote on Twitter.
The discipline officer should have known.
O'Dwyer was promoted in the cabinet at the end of last year and can be promoted under Turnbull, who said Wednesday he wants more women in his cabinet.
"No one wants to see more women in terms of power, influence, in Parliament, in the ministry, in the whole country," the prime minister told reporters in Parliament.
Abbott included one single woman in his first cabinet and, after the pressure to increase female representation in the Coalition, promoted a second woman in the cabinet, after the resignation in December.
Five things he wants the business environment from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will markets react?
Mal Maiden, an editor at BusinessDay, examines the impact Malcolm Turnbull might have on Australia's business sector.
Tuesday, lobbying groups in the business sector did not know how to manifest their enthusiasm more strongly when Malcolm Turnbull took over the country's branches as prime minister.
The main reason is that much of what many of them would have wanted to see was abandoned under Tony Abbott's leadership.
Or simply arrived at a suspension negotiated due to Abbott's "crash-or-crash-through" political style.
Representatives of interest groups spoke at the union about their hope in Turnbull's ability to satisfy public interest, reach political agreement and do things well.
So what exactly does the country's largest companies and their representatives expect from our new prime minister?
ChaFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to exceed negative publicity.
Turnbull itself has set the objective of initiating the free trade agreement with China.
In his first speech in which the media announced that challenge, the Free Trade Agreement between China and Australia (ChaFTA) represented the central point of his attack on Labour Leader Bill Shorten.
In a speech in August, Turnbull criticised "the revolting economic shoovism" by the Labour Party about that problem and expressed concern about racist criticism.
"In the context of the ChaFTA, the winners are, numerically, much more than the losers," he said in the same speech.
The business environment hopes that he will win this debate.
Don Argus, a legendary environmentalian, stressed that this is an essential point, being supported, among others, by the Australian Business Council (which represents the largest 100 companies in the country) and by James Packer, the billionaire of the gaming industry.
The business environment wants to conclude this agreement, and it will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to exceed negative publicity and negotiate with the whole Senate.
The Minister for Small Business, Bruce Billson, supports the recommendations of the Harper Analysis.
This could lead from the beginning to some differences in the business environment.
The impact assessment shall apply to large mergers and other contracts in order to decide whether consumers will suffer from a lack of competition.
It is called ‘effect assessment’ because it takes into account not only the actions and intentions of the company but also the effect it will have on competition and the market.
The way in which this assessment is drawn up is extremely important for the result.
The Harper analysis of competition law recommends a change in the impact assessment, which will make it more difficult for large companies to distance smaller operators from the market.
The government led by Tony Abbott was on the side of the Australian Business Council and the large retail traders.
Turnbull now makes sense that he wants the entire cabinet to think about what he's going to do next.
CAA jumped as a fire to claim that, if Turnbull follows the recommendations of the Harper analysis, consumers will be required to pay higher prices.
It is ironic that the whole business environment is the one that advised the new prime minister to have greater respect for the cabinet processes, which Turnbull seems to do by letting Bruce Billson, the Minister of Small Enterprises (which is on the part of Harper's recommendations) support his arguments in front of his colleagues.
Mediterranean diet could help prevent breast cancer
Spanish researchers have followed women between the ages of sixty and eighty years.
Those who eat mainly plants, fish and olive oil have significantly reduced the incidence of breast cancer.
Terrence Howard puts the multiplication table under the sign of the question
Terrence Howard is of the opinion that I completely misunderstood arithmetic.
The negative character in Empire said to Rolling Stone magazine that he doesn't think once he's equal to one.
"How can it be equal to one?" he said.
If once I do one, it means that two has no value, because once it itself has no effect.
Once I do two, because the fourth root of his four is two, so what is the fourth root of his two?
It should be one, but we're told there's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't really understand what you mean.
Not surprisingly, Howard's teachers did not agree with his theory, so he gave up at Pratt Institute, where he studied chemical engineering.
"Because you can't close your eyes when you know something's wrong," he explained.
Howard found for his parallel approach to mathematics the name "Terryology".
The actor testifies that he spends his time cutting and reassembling forearms, wires, magnets and plastics to illustrate his "one time" theory and other similar theories of his.
He told the magazine that he and his ex-wife, Mira Pak, spent up to 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.
The Rolling Stone editor described Howard's creations as "complex, two-dimensional and three-dimensional infinity, connected to copper wire or magnets".
Howard, among other things, hopes to receive the American patent 20150079872 A1 (“Systems and methods for improved construction work”).
Also, the actor from "Following an Idol" says that Pythagorean Einstein and Tesla would "get mad" if they saw terrorism.
"You know," he says, "I've been wondering since I was three or four years old why a ball takes a round shape?"
Why doesn't it become a triangle or a square?
I understand why.
Howard added that he was hoping to change the whole course of education.
"This will be the last century in which our children will learn that once they do one," he said.
They won't have to grow out of ignorance.
In twenty years now, they'll know that once they do two.
We're about to reveal a new truth.
The true universal mathematics.
We'll check in in 20 years.
Ariana Grande imitates Britney Spears at Wheel of Impression
On Tuesday, during the "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
The 22-year-old pop star sang little at Fallon's Wheel of Impression, playing "Mary Had a Little Lamb" as Spears, then displaying his vocal qualities with the song "The Wheels on the Bus" sung with Aguilera's voice.
In turn, Fallon did a good job imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
Both of them also played "I Can't Feel My Face" versions from The Weekend.
This week, Grande's name still appeared in the press.
It was the same day at Good Morning America, where it opened the show with the incident of the gogoasha lunch.
Taco Bell hopes that restaurants "cantina" where they will serve come to become points of urban interest
Would you like to spend an elegant night in town?
Taco Bell is an option.
On September 22, the Mexican-style fast food restaurant chain will open a new location in the Wicker Park area in Chicago, offering a menu of tapas aperitifs, a fresh painting by a local artist and even alcoholic drinks.
It is the first test location of Taco Bell Cantina restaurants in the chain, which addresses young people, concentrated in the city center.
Taco Bell, which has nearly 6,000 restaurants in the US, has roots mainly in the suburbs and is associated with cheap food, fast prepared, such as Doritos Locos Taco, extremely popular.
With an average payment note of 7 USD Taco Bell, the company used drive-through service and fast services to attract the number of customers needed to make a profit.
But Taco Bell says that to address a new generation who "seeks the most central urban environments in which to live, work and have fun", testing sites must follow a different model, with smaller spaces and expensive options.
To make a drive-through, you need the ground.
Can you imagine what it means to buy an acre of land in an area like Wicker Park?
"Do not allow yourself," said US TODAY Neil Borkan, Frenchman Taco Bell, who will operate the location in Chicago.
At the location of Chicago, the new menu will be prepared along with traditional offers Taco Bell, in an open kitchen, where "you will see the food at your own disposal" before it is prepared, said the Associated Press Meredith Sandland, Head of Development at Taco Bell.
Also at the new location will serve frozen wine, beer and alcoholic beverages, following the recent example of many Taco Bell competitors.
Now, seventy and five of Starbucks cafes offer evening menus that include beer, wine and tastings.
A thousand of the approximately 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic drinks.
The company said another Taco Bell Cantina location will open in San Francisco next to AT&T Park this month, replacing the drive-through service and parking with an internal court and a window for sale.
These changes in location, atmosphere and annexes indicate that the fast food restaurant chain wants to attract other types of customers besides those looking for fast food last night.
Taco Bell decided for the first time on a higher quality cooking line in 2012, when he opened the Cantina and Burritos more expensive menus to compete with Chipote, the project being supported by a advertising campaign focused on the content of new preparations proteins.
If they succeed, Cantina restaurants will take another step to a higher level.
Taco Bell said by 2022 he intends to open 2,000 restaurants in the US.
According to Sandland for AP, "a few hundred" of these will be the "Cantina" type.
They burned the phones in the middle of the night: Elton John makes Putin's court
Russian President Vladimir Putin phoned Elton John on Monday night only a few days after the British artist publicly declared he wanted to meet the Russian politician to discuss Russia's anti-gay legislation together.
British, declared homosexual, tried unsuccessfully to get an interview with Putin while he was in Russia in November 2014, one year after challenging the protests in this country and supported two concerts in 2013, during a period of turmoil in the history of this state, after the adoption of controversial laws, which prohibit "homsexual propaganda" in the minority ranks.
In 2014, at St. Petersburg, British artist criticised these laws and made the following statement in front of fans: "Although I am gay, I always felt that I was welcome here in Russia."
If I wasn't sincere about what I am, I wouldn't be able to compose these songs.
They don't mean gay propaganda.
They represent the way I express my life.
If we start punishing people for that, then their world will lose humanity.
Last Saturday, the artist disappointed that they wanted to meet with Putin to discuss this controversial issue.
So far, there is no clear information about the phone conversation between the two personalities.
Cocos "sing" all in the ANRP file
The businessman Dorin Cocos is trying to escape from a perjury sentence, "cantand" all in front of the judges and detailing how the millions of euros of former members of the ANRP Commission have been delivered.
Yesterday's hearing at the High Court of Housing and Justice in the case of Alin Cocos, former head of DIICOT Alina Bica and former members of the Central Commission for the Establishment of ANRP's Disbursements, Dorin Cocos was struck as the spark of sincerity.
He acknowledged all the charges and told the judges how he helped businessman Gheorghe Stelian in the case of ANRP's disbursements, in exchange for ordering him to be tried more quickly and taking into account his collaboration.
Thus, Cocos showed that he had known Gheorghe Stelian since 2006 and that he had been engaged in this after several real estate business.
He specified that Sergiu Diacomatu met him in 2010, and he told him that he was working at ANRP.
Later we found that (Diacomatu, n.r.) is Vice President, and because Gheorghe Stelian had a file at ANRP, we asked him to help us.
I promised him money, 2.5 million euros, money I told him I'd give him more money.
I also promised him political support, to remain in office.
"Diacomatu told me then to help me, but that he needs support," said Dorin Cocos in the courtroom.
He further said that, through knowledge, he entered into connection with Crinuta Dumitrean, who was then head of the Central Commission for Dispatch, which promised him 800,000 euros.
For Gheorghe Stelian's second file, I knew that he wanted to get over 300,000 euros.
Diacomatu already had political support, I also gave him five million euros.
Dumitrean's ring a million euros, I gave Dragos Bogdan 800,000 euros.
I'm telling you, all this money I've been giving him in cash to make sure the file is resolved.
"That's all I said to them: to solve the file, to undo the damage," said Cocos.
Asked why he had done these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million euros for the positive resolution of Gheorghe Stelian's second file.
I received, for the second file, eight million euros to solve the problem, but I only got 1.2 million euros left.
In 2013 I also met Alina Bica.
"I've never talked to this money or land," said Cocos.
He also showed that "it was noted that the ANRP all members understood before the seat."
I didn't have the emotions that they wouldn't vote positive.
All the functions were political in ANRP, but I personally didn't help Diacomatu.
"I told him that I only helped him politically to calm him down," Cocos concluded his statement.
Ponta brings the European Court of Justice to DNA
Prime Minister Victor Ponta was at the DNA yesterday for just five minutes, while he filed new documents in the "Turceni - Rovinari" file.
Victor Ponta fled to DNA with a document from the European Court of Justice
Convinced that the case prosecutor will receive him for a discussion on the basis of the file in which he is being investigated for fraud in private signatures, complicity in tax evasion and money laundering, Victor Ponta went on his own initiative to DNA, although the documents he might have been sent by the lawyer.
It wasn't to be that way, the intruder didn't have time, the prime minister leaving after five minutes, while he left several documents to register.
I wanted to make a decision by the European Court of Justice on 3 September, which explains what is going on with the services contracts.
I say we've done business, the prosecutor says we haven't done it, the European Court of Justice has told us to do both, because, as long as the fees have been paid, it's okay.
"From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is mandatory, certainly, for all European Union countries, we do not have a case here," said Prime Minister Victor Ponta, at the exit of the DNA.
The bridge further stated that, from a point of view, the decision of the European Court should apply, if we are members of the EU.
Until then, the prime minister expected the prosecutor to read the European Court's decision and call it back to the hearings, but also to give him an answer to his requests, including the disengagement of the file.
John they objected to the mandate of the television
In Romania today, there is no legal provision that forces you to watch television.
And even if you own such a device, since you pay your TV fee once with the energy bill.
But if you're the head of state, things change radically.
Because, in practice, it is understood that the position of the President of Romania is also included in the record of everyday reality.
President Johannis is intertwined daily in a total liner in the office or from Cotroceni
Only that, to the shock of even the closest people you'll get from the Cotroceni Palace, Klaus Johannis refuses to have TV in the presidential office.
And after they don't look at TV - at any program, not even at the German RTL or Pro Sieben posts - the president doesn't listen to radio posts and doesn't read the newspapers.
In addition, it does not even receive "negative monitoring" which, for example, the predecessor or a priority request.
Instead, Johannis was happy to receive only the report with the news that put him in a positive light.
And besides this informational self-isolation, where the only break is the access to the facebook, much more serious is the blocking to which, through its passiveness, the head of the state of impinging the entire activity of the presidential administration.
And because, although it's been so long since it was installed, Johannis hasn't signed the loyalty statements yet more than half of the employees of the presidential administration.
What is becoming an increasingly serious problem, from a human point of view, as well as legal.
Lines and peace
Those from the presidential background are already clear that no one can erase the "feng shui" from the state chief's office.
Where it's quiet and peace.
What's right, just after nine o'clock without a minute (no more, no less!), in the morning, when Sibi's ex-ideal demands the presence of officials.
A habit that probably didn't run out of time when he was leading the capital of the city from the Cybin.
And about the fact that Johannis doesn't want television in the office they've already been born with countless legends, being already people from the Cotroceni Palace who have come to turn to the variant that the president would try to avoid monitoring it.
Especially that he doesn't have any radio equipment.
Only that, at this rate, it follows to meditate as quickly as in the dark, because even lighting devices can hide audio-video recording techniques.
Just fine.
Also, another wonder from the Cotroceni Palace is the delivery to the head of state only of the "pzoitive monitoring" of the president's activity.
I mean, if there's any good news about Klaus Johnnis or his wife, the head of state will receive the content of this.
If not, no!
And more interesting is that it was banned from "negative monitoring" under conditions in which, for example, Traian Basescu was recognized not only as following night television broadcasts in which he was criticised, but as a matter of priority, negative news.
That doesn't mean the museum helped him with something, but that's what the gesture means!
And at least he can never have an excuse that he wasn't well informed from alternative sources.
Not outside, not confirmed
Now, up to the end, you're going to beat her and the mystery why he doesn't want to look at Klaus Johannis on TV.
Until then, however, it would be more important to resolve, regardless of the wording, the contractual situation of hundreds of employees of the presidential administration.
Which, in order to be able to work here, are obliged to sign a declaration of loyalty to the head of the state in charge and which must bear and sign it.
Only that, since December and so far, Klaus Johnnis has not signed to confirm even half of these statements, although it should have taken place within no more than 30 days.
Thus, hundreds of employees, representing more than half the staff at the Cotroceni Palace, have an uncertain situation now.
Because, legally speaking, if the head of state does not personally sign the statement, they should be thrown out.
Only that they all didn't get a negative opinion!
So, in a sense, I can come looking at the inspectors of the Court of Auditors, who will find that, over half a year, hundreds of people have received their wages at least somewhere on the edge of the law.
This will also be decided by the president if he gives them out or confirms them on their posts, and his decision is strict.
Authorities said a teenager launched an attack on Pope Francis during his U.S. visit
The ISIS inspired a teenager's plan to attack Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S. was rather "aspirational" than operational, confirmed a police source for Fox News on Tuesday.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in the Philadelphia area in August when the law enforcement authorities violated the plan.
The plan is the same as the representative of Texas, Mike McCaul, president of Internal Security, said a source for Fox News during a Sunday interview.
"We monitor very carefully the threats against the Pope for his visit to the United States of America," McCaul said at "This Week" from ABC.
Pope Francis was not mentioned as the specific target of the plan in a bulletin.
the Joint Information of the FBI and the Department of Internal Security of 14 August, which states that the adolescent was planning to use more attackers, firearms and explosives, with the aim of "a foreign dignitary during a high-level event".
The newsletter mentions that the minor has been radicalised through social networks.
A teenager may suffer from a mental illness, has declared a source of law enforcement authority for Fox News, but without giving details about the young person’s disease.
Also on Sunday, McCaul acknowledged the potential for an attack by a so-called "unique wolf" at the level of the entire nation and noted that he was informed by the Secret Services about a "strict secret location" for the visit of the Pope.
And with that comes a great risk of security... well, as the time approaches, I think we'll all be very vigilant and protect him when he gets to the United States.
Matt Dean from Fox News made this material.
The skeleton dating from the medieval period discovered in the tree suffered a violent death, say experts
Irish archaeologists have revealed misleading details about the strange skeleton dating from the medieval period, found at the root of a 215-year-old tree.
The tree of Colloney, Sligo, fell during a storm spent this year, drawing to light the macabre view of a skeleton caught between its roots.
The Irish National Monuments Service has brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to dig and analyze the remains, thus discovering an intrusive story.
"It was violent," said Marion Dowd, director of the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services, for FoxNews.com.
In the upper part of the chest there are wounds caused by the knife. There is another such trace in the left hand, which suggests that he was trying to defend himself.
The skeleton is of a young man between the ages of 17 and 20.
Radiocarbon analysis shows that residues are between 900 and 1000 years old.
"We cannot know whether he was killed in a fight or in a personal dispute," says Dowd, noting that the body was buried after a Christian ritual, with his head headed west.
"Probable was buried by family or community," she added.
Dowd said to FoxNews.com that who planted the tree didn't know about the grave.
"It was just a coincidence, the context is an unusual one," she said.
There are historical documents certifying that there is a church and a cemetery in the area, but today there are no visible traces of them.
There is another unusual aspect of the discovery: the height of the young man.
"He had 1 meter 77," says Dowd.
For the medieval society of time, that means a lot.
The federal government spends $1.5 million to study what babies think about eating
National Institutes for Health (NIH) have spent nearly $1.5 million studying what small children think about food.
The project, called "the way in which babies and small children are perceived food", is being carried out by the University of Chicago and has so far determined that small people are not prepared to eat lentil foods from other people or who have been killed by others.
According to the project's funder, "appropriate nutrition is important for health and longevity, but many Americans do not have healthy diets from a nutritional point of view".
There is evidence that the first food models of infants and young children have long-lasting consequences for the health of all lives.
The pressure for this study is that research into how babies eat is lacking.
“Despite the complexity and significance of food selection, child development psychologists have given little attention to the way in which infants and young children perceive, learn, and understand food, the financier said.
The current proposal applies methods of cognitive development to test social influences on the choice and consumption of food in infants and young children.
Researchers say about babies that they have "limited knowledge in the food field".
Children between three and six years of age "know more about food than babies and young children", but they are "extreme consumers of mofturos".
An actress who played "Star Trek: Voyager" is accused of improper exposure to Tennessee
An actress who played in the TV series Star Trek: Voyager was arrested in the summer of Tennessee, being accused of being exposed to children.
Several media channels report that Jennifer Ann Lien, 41-year-old actress, who played Kes' role in the television series, is accused of two offences of improper exposure, in which children under the age of 13 were involved, according to the arrest report.
Officers of the sheriff's office in Roane County brought the warrant to Lien's house in Harriman on 3 September, where they said they found an empty under a couch on the couch.
Officers said Lien refused their requests to get dressed.
The chief of the Harriman police, Randy Heidle, says that Lien's multiple charges were brought, including that of corporal injury in a worse form, after the April incident in which Lien said he had entered a police car with a personal car.
She still doesn't know if she has a lawyer.
Police identified the murdered victim found in the Epping forest
A man whose dead body was discovered in a tourist forest was identified.
On 9 September, Hidir Aksakal, 53 years old, was found near Hollow Ponds in the Epping forest, north-east of London.
The Turkish-born man lived in Margate, Kent, and had close links to the Green Lanes area in Haringey, north of London.
Last time he was seen in Green Lanes in the morning of Monday, August 17.
A postmortem analysis proved that he was killed, and the detectives say that his body is probably several weeks in the Epping forest.
Inspector General Jamie Piscopo, from the Metropolitan Police, said: “Mr Aksakal was very well known locally as Boxer Cetin and we hope to find out from the Green Lane community information that will help us in the investigation.
Hollow Ponds is a popular tourist resort, where there is a cafe and a lake for boat trips.
It is also surrounded by streets with intense traffic.
We ask all those who have been in the area in the last few weeks and may have observed some unusual or suspicious activity to come and discuss with us.
Super Chief: Six Women Jump Between Motherhood and Service
Unlike any other country in the world, except Papua New Guinea, there is no centralized policy on maternity leave paid in the United States of America.
Two weeks ago, when the executive director of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, announced that she was pregnant with twins, he was going to take a very short maternity leave and "work in his spare time", the 40-year-old woman was criticized on a large scale to encourage a culture that awaits the superfem or nothing.
But, Mayer, she herself a symbol of the top woman, to be guilty of unrealistic expectations?
How do other women's leaders handle it?
Seema Patel, a lawyer and deputy director of the San Francisco Labour Standards Bureau, just got a job in the government in Washington DC a few years ago, when her boss surprised her with an unexpected advice.
"I don't know anything about you," her boss said.
But if you're going to make a family for you in the future, you're going to get a break from now on.
Patel's employer was the federal government, and she didn't even get one day's maternity leave paid as part of her work contract.
By then Patel was unmarried and very focused on his career, and the family was the last thing he was thinking about.
But she listened to her boss' advice.
She avoided using her days of medical leave for four years, so when she was pregnant with her first child, two years ago, she was forced to pay three months of leave.
Six months ago, when the second child was born, Patel could no longer implement the same strategy.
The four months of release that he took were completely unpaid.
Patel says he didn't feel any rejection from her colleagues, but he has a problem with the structure of work.
"It seems very discouraging to anyone trying to have a family," she says.
Send a message: Your country doesn't value you becoming a parent.
Karen Choi, vice president of the Capital Group asset management company, says that any female employee who is and mother should be praised.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six - month - old baby, describes the yoke between the quality of mother and the job as “a constant struggle”.
The secret to not suffocating is to have "an incredible family next to you" and a nice and babysitter, to accept that there are things that will not be the best (“not everyone can be Martha at internal threats”) and just go through it.
Choi says he took an increasing maternity leave for each child, starting from two months and half for the first and ending with six months for the last.
This makes it an exception, especially in her area of activity.
When your child is sick, he has fever, vomiting, and you stay all night to take care of him and you know that the next morning you have to take the other kids to school, then go to work...
Then it gets very complicated," she says.
However, its company has supported it and points out that the performance of its investment portfolio had nothing to do with it.
When he went into the finance industry, after college, about 20 of her college colleagues chose the same way, she said.
Today, about 90% of them have given up.
Women who quit their jobs, then start again, they no longer have the same chances at the top paid well, she says.
It's hard to stay: "In the short term it's a sacrifice, but in the long term the results are seen."
Anyway, her children helped her make sense of this sacrifice, because all four of her children are girls.
One of the things that helps me go further is that I would like to be a model for them.
The idea of being an example for her four children is what motivates the scientist and Professor Kelly Posner, at the age of 48.
The children know that their mother helps, on their own, to save human lives.
Posner, founder and director of the Center for the Evaluation of Suicide Risk at Columbia University, says it is important for women to know that they can have a "great objective" in terms of career and to meet it.
It's very important for women to believe I can have a vision.
Most people don't allow themselves to believe this," she says.
He once held a presentation in front of 200 people, including government officials, in Italy during a webinar, when he was pregnant in eight months.
She also helped with technology, she says, because she can stop the car and answer the phone after taking the kids or answering an e-mail from the march.
The yoke between maternity and an applicant career was helped by an optimistic personality, aimed at solving problems, she says. The ability to bring things to a good end even when this seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, aged 33, Executive Director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and mother of two children, says that making maternity and career work together only through private aid networks, such as dolls, is wrong.
"You should not be lucky or win the lottery to succeed," she says, describing the failure of the system to support women and families - mentioning very small wages, the poor health system and the lack of a paid maternity leave.
"As a society, we don't care about each other," she says.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of mothers who just were born.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while following law school courses, gave birth to her baby while she was getting a scholarship.
With a husband and a child based on the medical care provided by the scholarship, the labor leader was able to take a maternity leave of just two weeks, then return to work.
Lisa Mosko, a fashionist and mother-in-law of two children, says that less and less women will leave their profession if they benefit from more social support, in the form of day care services from companies, maintaining programs established by common agreement and accepting that efficient work does not mean staying over the program.
In the face of logistical constraints, says Mosko, there is additional pressure to act in an area where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epitom of a lack of taste (“mother’s clothes” is one of the most serious insults).
"The image is part of our job - it raises you or shoots you down," she explains.
Moscow's "Permanent Negotiation" for its multiple roles to function harmoniously means to keep its appearance and a beautiful bag in hand, from which, however, sometimes to fall a double toy.
If he remembers that men are fathers, society could allow women to do more.
People don't judge men that they're not good fathers as they judge women who are mothers.
Shola Olatoye, president and executive director of the New York City Housing Authority, which deals with the dwellings of over 400,000 new Yorkers and has over 11,000 employees, says that maternity and career do not mean talking about "cheilbria".
The notion of balance is a bit inappropriate.
It looks more like a balance sheeter," she says.
Mother of three children, one of whom has only three months, she just took a seven-week maternity leave after she was born this year.
"It was a very important period for the agency," she explains.
He knew that seven weeks would not be enough, but her husband managed to give up his paternity, and she managed to have a flexible program, which means to leave early or late, so that she could breastfeed her child.
Olatoye, who runs with her friends every morning ending at 06:00 (“ cheaper than therapy”) still breast-feeding.
At work, he tried to create an environment "friendly for parents", in which a child's delay is allowed, and the reply to e-mails should not be sent uninvited from the office.
"The concept and family notion have changed and changed very much," says Olatoye.
"The family is very different from what was 25 or even 10 years ago."
The job is the one that needs to be adapted.
Russian killers say they cheated Elton John on a Putin phone.
For scientists it seemed too nice to be true: a phone from Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, to Sir Elton John, a singer and militant for the rights of sexual minorities, in which to discuss the rights of homosexuals.
Unfortunately for John, it was not true: despite an exuberant post on Instagram in which thanks to the Russian leader that he addressed him about the problem, it immediately became clear that anyone who would have called him at night would certainly not have been Putin.
The Kremlin had already declared that he had no knowledge of that conversation.
And on Wednesdays, two famous Russian humorists admitted that they, not the president, were foreign voices from the other end of the conversation.
"We thought it was unlikely that Putin would like to meet with him or call him, or at least not too soon," says Vladimir "Vovan" Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his colleague, Alexei "Lexus" Stoliarov, became the spokesman for the president's speech, Dmitri Peskov.
"It seems that Elton John was really waiting for this phone, so he immediately thought that it was really a conversation with the right people we were giving us," he told Komsomolskaya Pravda.
He said, "Thank you, it was the surprise of the day."
This day and this conversation have been the most beautiful and delightful of my life.
In order to complete John's plight, the two announced that they would publish a recording of the conversation at a popular Russian night show.
John's representatives did not make statements about the speculations.
The story is based on comments made by the song this weekend, in which Putin criticised his attitude towards homosexuals while fighting for LGBT rights in Kiev, in particular criticizing a Russian law adopted in 2013, which prohibits the spread of "propaganda for non-traditional sexual relations" among minors.
"I would like to meet Putin, to talk," John told the BBC, saying that although the idea was "probably unrealistic", it still deserves a trial.
Then, on the evening of the evening, the singer voiced the distrust of observers when he published a message on a social network, claiming that Putin responded to his critics by taking the phone and calling it.
He said "he looked forward to meeting [the president] in front of him to discuss LGBT equality in Russia".
Unfortunately for John, Putin was not the one from the other end of the line, but Stoliarov and Krasnov, known for the phones given in the joke of many Russian and Ukrainian celebrities and politicians.
Stoliarov, who speaks well English, played Peskov's role and claimed to be the interpreter of the two.
When asked about the possibility of a conversation, true Peskov told reporters Tuesday that Putin would "prepared to meet Elton John and answer all his questions", but Kremlin did not receive such a request from the singer.
The Kremlin had reason to question the authenticity of Instagram's post, he added, "especially because it is not completely written in a correct English."
We don't think Sir Elton John would have written such grammatical errors.
Before the Russian duet declared his public platoon, local media channels already suspected that John was the victim of a joke.
Some users of the online environment identified Krasnov as guilty, known for the farts made by the telephone politicians he recorded and posted on his YouTube channel as Vovan222.
Phone calls to public people, then publishing recordings have become a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliarov, who is considered by many as the founder of the genre, has developed the ability to make them pass on to Ukrainian politicians.
He was interviewed on the phone on Ukrainian television, imitating Anton Gerašchenko, the direct adviser of Interior Minister Arsen Avakov.
He imitated Geraşchenko so well that last year he spoke to Dnipropetrovsk's former governor, Ihor Kolomoski, better than six hours in several days.
Krasnov became known after the 2011 parliamentary elections, which led to massive street protests following mass fraud reports.
As Arkadi Dvorkovich, the president's councillor Dmitri Medvedev since then convinced the president of the electoral committee, Vladimir Churov, that Medvedev intended to release him.
In addition to numerous Russian celebrities, among his victims were former President Urss Mihail Gorbaciov, the Prime Minister of Kiev and the champion at the Vitali Klitschko Box and the Russian Sports Minister Vitali Mutko, who tricked him to apologize for the behavior of his athletes.
Last year, Krasnov would have called the Belarusian president Aleksandr Lukashenko, becoming the son of the Ukrainian leader, Viktor Ianukovici.
It was so convincing, that the person from the other end, whose voice was sown with Lukashenko, offered him asylum.
John's initial statement that he would like to discuss with Putin caused a huge reaction in Russia.
The legislator Vitali Milonov of St. Petersburg, who contributed to the "propaganda" law, told The Guardian that John should not bother Putin with a "so irrelevant subject" and that he was ready to meet with the singer to explain Russia's position.
Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper opened an online survey for readers, in which 39% of respondents felt that Putin and John should meet, and 22% felt that such a meeting would damage Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that more people die from air pollution than malaria and HIV/AIDS
According to a new reference study, more than 3 million people a year die prematurely due to air pollution from outside, more than malaria and HIV/AIDS together.
The main cause, especially in Asia, is wood and coal burning for housing and cooking, but research reveals that agricultural emissions in Europe and the USA are such an alarming reason for these deaths.
The report warns that if no measures are taken, the number of deaths - already equivalent to six deaths per minute - will double by 2050.
"These projects should signal an alarm to public health agencies around the world," said Professor Michael Jerrett, an environmental expert at the University of California, who was not involved in research.
Most of the deaths caused by air rain are caused by tiny particles, which can be inhaled deep in the lungs.
They cause heart attack and stroke, which are responsible for three quarters of the 3.3 million annual deaths, while the rest are caused by lung cancer and respiratory diseases.
Research did not include the effects of indoor air pollution, for example from cooking fires, which are estimated to cause another 3.4 million deaths a year.
The new study, published in the Nature newspaper, is the first to highlight several sources of air pollution from outside and estimate the number of premature deaths caused by them, taking into account road traffic, fossil fuel-based plants and other sources.
Researchers have used a detailed computerized model of the global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on the various populations, including new information on how pollution affects the inhabitants of China and India.
A third of all premature deaths have been the result of the use of smoke-extracting fuels, such as wood and coal, for housing heating or cooking, and the use of dirty diesel generators for electricity, all of which are recognized dangers.
The consumption of this type of domestic energy results in half of the 645,000 annual deaths in India and one third of the 1.4 million annual deaths in China.
However, the research found that ammonia agricultural emissions had a "remarkable" impact, according to Professor Jos Lelieveld of the German Chemical Max Planck Institute, which led the research.
A fifth of deaths at global level are caused by these emissions, mainly from cattle, birds and pigs and from excessive use of fertilisers.
Ammonia reacts with exhaust gases from traffic and industry and produces small particles, being the main reason for the deaths due to air pollution in the US, Japan and Europe.
"For London, agriculture is the main source," says Lelieveld.
Throughout the United Kingdom, 48% of premature deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Traffic pollution is still an important factor in the developed countries, causing a fifth of the deaths, despite measures against the pollutants.
This caused only 5% of deaths worldwide, but the number could increase as more cars appear on the streets in developing countries.
Air pollution by the centrals, in particular by those operating with coal, has been significant at global level, causing one of seven deaths.
In the US it is the main single factor, causing a third of the 55,000 annual deaths, compared with 16% in the United Kingdom.
Natural air pollution, especially in arid and dusty regions, has caused nearly five deaths worldwide due to air pollution.
This source is a major factor in some arid countries, responsible for 92% of the deaths in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
"The overlap between the high level of pollution and the large number of people say the word about public health, but nothing else is known about the sources of pollution responsible for premature deaths," Jerrett says.
The results are surprising and potentially important for the protection of public health at global level.
Currently, all particles are as toxic as they are.
However, if fuel burning is more toxic, as some scientists suspect, the percentage of premature deaths that can be attributed to agricultural emissions would be smaller.
Even so, says Jerrett, "the discovery is very valuable... because agriculture has not generally been seen as a major source of air pollution or premature death and suggests that much more attention should be paid to agricultural sources, both by science and political leaders".
Dr. Oliver Wild, an atmosphere specialist at the University of Lancaster in the United Kingdom, said: “The study really emphasizes the need for air quality control to avoid these deaths, especially in the very populated areas of Asia. ”
Victor Ponta's statement tensions and more relations with Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to stop lying, the Roman Prime Minister speaks of attitudes that bring to mind Nazism
Relations with Hungary, already stressed after the announcement of building a fence on the border with Romania, after the sarba border, have experienced a new depression following the statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who has accused the authorities of treating refugees "with battle and insemination" in Budapest months.
Hungary's diplomacy has reacted strongly to the assertions of "extremists and liars", but Victor Ponta has not been left any worse and has accused the government officials in the neighbouring country of being "a shame" for Europe.
Note that it is not for the first time when Ponta is trying to strain Romano-ungarian relations by making statements in delicate moments or with an electoral character.
It all started with a statement made by Victor Ponta Monday, in which he tried to argue that Romania could not receive more than 1,800 refugees.
The problem you have with our logistics ability to treat those people like some people, not how they treat our neighbors, with battles and battles.
I don't agree with that.
Mr. Basescu has put himself in the face of an ugly and horrible feeling that exists in all societies, namely a xenophobic feeling.
It's very good to have a debate, but it's our job to solve the problem.
"We'll treat those people like us," said Victor Ponta, quoted on Monday.
It is not clear what Victor Ponta referred to when he spoke about the inclusion of refugees, but Cehia was recently in the centre of criticism after writing numbers on the hands of migrants in several trains, in a gesture that remembered the procedure used by Nazis to identify Jewish prisoners from concentration camps.
Peter Szijarto appreciated, according to the Hungarian news agency MTI, taken by Magyaridok.hu, that perhaps internal political crises that have shaken Victor Ponta's position make him make the statements "extremist and liar".
The business in Budapest was called to provide explanations, mediafax reports, quoting MTI.
"Mr. Victor Ponta has recently made inadequate statements about how Hungary manages the immigration crisis," the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs states.
Levente Magyar, State Secretary for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in Hungary, expressed "surprise" in connection with "the constant attempts of Victor Ponti to save his controversial moral position by anti-ungulate lies", he stressed the diplomacy of Budapest.
"I do not want to respond to the challenges that have come from a representative government of the Hungarians - but read the report below and you will understand the indignation that I feel, as a European man and a citizen, the face of the mentality and attitudes that Europe saw only in the 1930s!!", wrote Ponta, on his Facebook account.
He argues that, like other European politicians, he has "the duty" to attract attention and sanction "the constant conduct of government officials at the highest level in Hungary" who are "a Russian for European Union culture and values" by "anti-Semitic attitudes", "the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now in the refugee crisis!"
"Sarma gimpata, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, political decisions are better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which the refugees fled!", accused Ponta, claiming that he believes in "solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in the superiority of European values", and "what we see in Hungary in the last days is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!"
During the series, Ponta was invited to Antena 3, where the main subject was Hungary.
If Mihai Gadea called Viktor Orban the black sheep of Europe, a dictator, Ponta wondered what would happen if the Hungarian military were to arrest and shoot or kill some children or women, in a speech that made several references to Nazism.
In the dispute, UDMR president Kelmen Hunor also intervened, who considered that the Roman authorities should not have a "sensitive approach" in relation to Hungary's intention to build a fence on the border.
The UDMR leader claims that it must be understood that this solution is not directed against Romania or the Roman citizens, he argues that the fence could even help our country not become an intense transit route by migrants who will reach the Schengen area, according to Agerpres.
First of all, I want to stress, to say, that we don't have to get married, take this whole thing as something against Romania, and don't have to use it to worsen any relationship between the two governments, because it's not the case.
I think any sentimental approach is wrong.
"We need to see the rational part, see why we have come here, and we need to know and say this, that it is not against us, it is not against Romania, Roman citizens, and it does not prevent the free movement of the two states within the EU," Kelemen Hunor said.
The West ignored in 2012 Russia's bid to infiltrate Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership
Russia has now proposed to introduce President Bashar al-Assad, President of Syria, as part of a peace agreement, in accordance with an official high involvement at that time in the negotiations with the doors closed between the West and the Russian Federation, The Guardian writes.
The former President of Finland and Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti Ahtisaari said the Western powers have not benefited from the proposal since then.
Since 2012, tens of thousands of people have died and other millions have been forced to flee the country, giving birth to the most serious refugee crisis since the end of World War II.
Ahtisaari held talks with the representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (USA, the United Kingdom, France, the Russian Federation, and China) in February 2012.
It further stated that during the discussions, the Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churchin offered a plan that included among others and the proposal addressed to Assad to give up power at a given time, after the beginning of the peace treaties between the regime and the opposition.
It proposed three things:
One - we don't have to arm the opposition.
Two - we need to start a dialogue between Assad and the opposition immediately.
"Three - we have to look for an elegant way to get Assad back," Ahtisaari said, relating the position of the Russian ambassador.
However, he also said that Ahtisaari, the United States, the UK and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator followed him each, although they ignored the Russian ambassador's proposal.
"It was a lost opportunity in 2012", Finland's former president continued.
Russia has officially supported Bashar al-Assad throughout the four and a half years of war, insisting that its induction cannot represent a proposal in any peace agreement.
Assad believes that Russia will never abandon him.
Moscow recently began sending troops, tanks and military aircraft to Syria, in an effort to stabilize Assad's regime and to confront the extremists of the Islamic State.
Antenea 3 live program will be available at cost
Antenna 3 informed her, Tuesday, viewers as from 1 November the program or live will be able to be viewed online at cost, on the basis of a monthly subscription.
In a "record to the viewers", the post of the story of the Trust Intact states that "we do this with the heart of our heart, wanting you to stay with us and at this new stage, imposed by the conditions of the market".
According to the message, the subscription will be 1 euro per month "for those of you who follow us online", the television promising that the viewing will be of a very good quality.
Antenna 3 argues that "all these broadcasts live in the country and abroad, campaigns, daily news have been and are possible through a constant financial effort, assumed, which has assumed a permanent reintroduction and quality focus".
We managed to support ourselves, provided that offline and online distributors contributed nothing for the content offered.
The announcement comes under conditions where the television news program is accessible on the basis of subscription and online Antena Play platform, where, otherwise, it was most often accessible exclusively and the Antene's broadcast recordings.
Reports show that the populations of marine animals and plants have half-life over the last 40 years
The scale of the crisis facing marine animals and plants is documented in detail in a study stating that marine species from all over the globe, including those essential for human food security, are in a decline that can be catastrophic.
Unprecedented pressures from several directions to the global ocean ecosystem combine and create an era of difficulties for almost all marine life, says the WWF's report "The Blue Planet".
Coral reefs are subject to serious risks of decline (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and sea herbs, which depend on many other species, have recorded a significant decline, while all fish populations with commercial value, such as macro and tuna, have dropped greenhouses with three spheres by the 1970s, the report shows.
Many coral reefs, usually described as tropical oceans forests due to their huge biodiversity, could be threatened with extinction up to half this century if ocean acid continues to deteriorate, as a result of increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, resulting in a direct increase in the level of carbon dioxide in the sea.
"Healthy seas are a source of extraordinary beauty and natural surprise and are also a basis for the functioning of the global economy," said Louise Heaps, CEO of marine policies at WWF-UK, who contributed to the launch of the report.
"By overfishing, which damage coastal habitats, and without solving the global warming problem, we look like seeds of an ecological economic catastrophe," said Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of published scientific literature, but also on the indexes of the living planet, a database maintained by the Zoological Society of London, is one of the most detailed marine life studies ever undertaken.
Nearly 20% of the total mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) It has researched a great variety of marine species, fish, brownfish and sea turtles - an animal similar to a worm, with sharp skin - to marine plants such as mangroves and algae.
The report found that the areas of algae decreased by approximately 30% in the last century, while the total of mangrove areas decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of shrimp fishing and other forms of aquaculture.
During a single generation, human activity has caused huge damage to the ocean, catching fish faster than it can reproduce and also destroying their banks.
Deep changes are needed to ensure an abundant ocean life in the next generations," said Marco Lambertini, CEO of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines have been recorded in fish species for commercial profits.
For example, 58 populations of 17 species belonging to the Scrombidae - macrou, tuna and sardines - have dropped by 74% between 1970 and 2010, without any sign of recovery, says the report.
We are in a course of fishing that could end with people being deprived of a vital food source and an essential economic engine.
The overfishing, the destruction of marine habitats and climate change have serious consequences for the entire human population, and the poor communities, based on the sea, will be hit the fastest and most powerful," Lambertini said.
"The collapse of ocean ecosystems could trigger a serious economic decline and could undermine our struggle to eradicate poverty and undernutrition," he continued.
Professor Ken Norris, the scientific director of the ZL, said: “These alarming figures show how fast people and animals in the oceans change and represent a clear warning about the problems we could face as a result.”
Sea grass: deep "peas" submarines, which capture the rich sediments in minerals and stabilize the seabed.
Over the last century, the surface has decreased by 30%.
Mangrove: their existence is known in 123 countries, almost half of the total area representing only five countries.
Nearly 20% of the total mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005, mainly due to human invasion.
Coral reefs: some of the richest and most productive habitats on earth.
A quarter of all marine species live in coral reefs or near them, but three quarters of them are currently threatened and many can disappear during this century if the acidity of the ocean continues to deteriorate.
Deep habitats: very little is known about the deep ocean areas, but the decline in the number of fish caught in these inaccessible locations over the last 40 years suggests that they are also affected by global marine changes.
Steven Gerrard denies the charges of racism that would have been brought to him by his former Liverpool coach, El-Hadji Diouf
In a passage from his autobiography in "My Story", serialized by Daily Mail, Gerrard criticizes the Senegalese player saying that "he is not really interested in football" and that he is the colleague who liked "the least" in the 17 years spent at the club.
As a response, Diouf would have replied to Gerrard on the Senegalese radio station Groupe Futurs Media, with quoted translation attributed to the attacker, who would have said that "Gerrard never liked the colouring people".
Gerrard's lawyers denied any charges of racism he brought.
In his most recent book, Gerrard, who made himself public even before his bad opinion about Diouf, criticised the attitude and degree of professionalism of his former colleague.
"I don't want to waste my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his irony seasons in Liverpool as an example of how things can go on track," he writes.
"It seems to me that Diouf is not really interested in football and that he doesn't care about Liverpool at all," he continued.
For example, the way in which he shot a huge and vicious flag in a Celtic fan in a game of Cupa Uefa from Parkhead in March 2003 is evidence of his contemptuous and ranchiunous behavior.
Diouf proved himself a controversial figure all the time spent on Anfield, his most famous night being that of Celtic Park.
The former Senegalese was questioned by the police after the episode of the escape and amended by his payroll for two weeks at the club, the amount of 60,000 pounds being given to a humanitarian organisation at the Celtic election.
In his previous autobiography, published in 2007, Gerrard describes Diouf as lazy and selfish.
"His attitude was completely wrong," Gerrard then wrote.
I felt that he wasn't ready to make every effort to help Liverpool get back to the top.
Diouf, who now plays at the Malaysian club Sabah, criticised him, in his turn, in public Gerrard and attacked the old friend and teammate of Gerrard, Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf called Gerrard "egoist" and claimed that no Anfield liked the player who led the team to the 2005 Champions League victory.
Diouf is also quoted as saying that Gerrard is "gelos".
He said: “Gerrard is just jealous of me.
He didn't touch the results I had in football.
When I came to Liverpool, I came with the status of the boss, and he lives there.
I'm respected in the world of football, the biggest football experts have framed me between the first seven players at the World Championship and the first 100 players of the century.
Many big players don't have a feeling of belonging.
Wherever I go in other countries, I'm venerable, while Gerrard is hated every time he leaves his hometown Liverpool.
From the hero to the professional dancer: Alek Scarlatos's fast way to "Dancing With the Stars"
In this season of "Dancing With the Stars", Alek Scarlatos does not only play the role of hero in uniform.
It is also a young, attractive and athletic guy, equally discreet and modern, says producers.
"There are many categories and we are always looking for the most popular of the time," said Deena Katz, an executive co-producer of the ABC show.
I swear he'll find his impression after that.
It's delicious.
He's got something special.
Before he competes in the famous show - but only a few weeks before - Scarlatos came to the international press after taking a stand for a great danger.
He and the two friends of his childhood, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler, immobilized a man armed with an AK-47 in a train full of travelers going from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three stopped what could have been a mass murder by a possible terrorist.
After that, Scarlatos, a 22-year-old saint in the National Army, who grew up near Sacramento, received a phone call from President Obama, a message on Twitter from Donald Trump and a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the American army and the French government.
Although it may anticipate some local appreciations - Friday, at Sacramento, there was a parade in the youth's ranks - there was not expected to be so many positive reactions or the invitation to participate in "Dancing With the Stars".
"Not in a million years I wouldn't have thought I'd get this offer," said Scarlatos on Saturday, at a dance break with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.
Everything seems new and crazy.
Even though before the show last night he acknowledged that he was "easyly excited", he managed as a professional at his first Foxtrot, getting points that brought him close to the front of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hough, who formed the jury, said he offered one of the best performances of the series.
Katz and the executive producer from "DWTS" Rob Wade said they want to keep a free place in the show for competitors invited to the last hundred meters, as is the case of Scarlatos, who grew up in the eyes of the public.
In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends on vacation, who launched a gun attack on a 500-passenger train and immediately thought of inviting one of them to the dance competition.
He searched the social networks, found the family members and sent messages to Scarlatos.
When it appeared at Good Morning America to tell the incident during which Stone and other passengers were injured, Katz worked with ABC's program to avoid passing through all media bars.
And he supported the "five-minute prayer", then he looked forward to finding out if Scarlatos would agree to participate in the "DWTS".
"For a while everything was very uncertain, because that's so different from what he does," Katz confessed.
A little while ago, fighting in Afghanistan, and now I'm asking him if he has a dance leader.
Scarlatos, who is in a short holiday at the National Guard, had not even seen a whole show before.
He hesitated to participate, mainly because he didn't want to be the only one who showed up.
The show couldn't invite all three friends.
But the producers had an ass in their hands: Noah Galloway, a war veteran, with their hands and legs amputated.
They encouraged Scarlatos to call Galloway, the favorite fan and finalist of the past season, and ask him about his experience.
That was probably the critical point, along with Katz's unstoppable "damaging" and "insistent messages", she said.
"Noah is a wonderful guy and I wanted to know how the army will be seen and how my friends' image will be protected," Scarlatos said.
He told me I should go.
So, after that conversation, I accepted.
Scarlatos, the great sports and history lover, never danced before, and Arnold testified in interviews that he was trying to make him relax and give up the military position pretty hard.
But Katz says it is confident that it will adapt and that viewers will react positively.
He'll get a lot of love from the beginning, because people are proud of him and what he did.
"How can you not stand it?" said Katz.
But this will only take a few weeks.
To go further, he has to dance.
Scarlatos, who is a burlach and wants to become a cop, says that, so far, he's had a lot of fun in this completely unknown environment to him.
The program was the hardest fight, and it was necessary to travel frequently to Los Angeles between the times when it was called on in the media and the various premieres.
He said that at the end of August, when he returned to the U.S. immediately after the train incident, he just wanted to relax with his family.
"It lasted about a day and a half," he said.
In total, I stayed home for four days.
There is a risk in the presence of a person who attracts media attention, but it is not usual to be in the light of reflectors, executive producer Wade said.
And the issue wants to ensure that the competitor manages and entertains himself.
"The pressure is great and we want participants to have a nice experience," Wade said.
"I don't want Alek ever to say, "Aoleu, what did I stick to?"
Let's keep his fingers to the fun.
McRib McDonald's coming back.
The time has come for those who wait all year for the pork sandwich in the form of mini-coast to enjoy.
But is it harder to find this year?
CNBC reports that only 55% of the French McDonald's in the country offers this season specialty.
Last year, 75% of the restaurants served McRib sandwich.
"The McRib 2015 promotion participates around 8,000 restaurants," McDonald's spokesman Lisa McComb said in an e-mail to The Times.
In the US there are less than 14 300 restaurants of this fast-food.
However, according to McComb, individual French owners decide whether or not to serve McRib.
"Participation is not significantly different from last year," McComb says.
Owners/operators are free to offer the menu that they consider to be desired by their local clients.
And if you still wonder what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain his ingredients last year, with a video that shows the reality.
According to the video, McRib sandwich is prepared from pig meat, water, dextrose and preservatives.
The sandwich will be available by the end of the year, at McDonald's participating restaurants.
There is also a website where McRib (unaffiliated at McDonald's), which can be useful.
People can report on the website if they discover restaurants with McRib and can look for the nearest place to where this sandwich is served.
However, a quick search on the site shows that the closest restaurant with McRib of Los Angeles is in Sebastopol in Sonoma County, discovered last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.

Keith Richards suggests that new Rolling Stones recordings will be prepared
Keith Richards is again in the light of the reflections with a new solo album and an appearance in a documentary, but soon, and other members of the Rolling Stones group could join him in the studio.
Richards announced that he and the others at Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - met recently in London and made "clear plans of registration", as he says.
Tuesday night, Richards spoke in the ICONS series from iHeartRadio to reporter Jim Kerr.
A possible new album from Stones would be the first LP of the band after "A Bigger Bang" in 2005.
But the team wasn't inactive at all.
In recent years they have had many tournaments on stadiums and played in several small concerts in L.A., including representations at the Echoplex and the Theatre Foundation.
In the last of these, they reinterpreted the classic LP in 1971, "Sticky Fingers".
In particular, Richards was busy this year, working with the documentary "Keith Richards: Under the Influence", scheduled to be launched on Netflix on 18 September.
This year, he released the single album "Crosseyed Heart", his third solo in a career of five decades.
Randy Lewis of The Times described Richards' new album in a previous interview with the guitarist: "Always Richards' voice is a more kind instrument than distinguished..."
But Richards gets excited in all the 15 songs of the album and that always meant, in fact, the rock 'n' roll.
In the interview, Richards says the team will most likely enter the studio after the South American tournament from the beginning of next year.
He did not give any other details, but, judging by the last concerts, the band is still very full of life.
The Toronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman on Childhood, Mature and "The Family Fang"
Jason Bateman has already gone through some difficult transitions in his career, with a discreet pharmacy that made them seem much simpler than they actually were.
Sometimes an actor child in television shows such as Silver Spoons, as an adult, has reaffirmed himself as an inexpressive typical in the television series "Situation of Crisis" and in films such as "Chief of Cosmar".
The first film he worked as director was the very acid comedy "Bad Words", in which he played and played.
The film was nominated at the International Film Festival in Toronto in 2013.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with "The Family Fang", the second film he directed, an ambitious tonal film, adapting the 2011 Kevin Wilson's popular novel. The script is written by David Lindsay-Abaire, the winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and in the movie Nicole Kidman and Bateman, in the role of the troubled brothers.
The film is about a festival looking for American distribution.
Many book reviews have considered it a comedy with strong emotional tents; the film reinterprets the story, placing more emphasis on its dramatic, darker side.
In an interview given to our publication Tuesday, Bateman says he has always considered the book more drama than a comedy.
"I've never seen a book like this," he confessed.
In the book, the subject and the topics are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin was dealing with a very sensitive subject in a very funny way.
So that was always the order in which I saw things, a drama with moments of frivolity and comedy and eccentricity.
The world premiere of the evening has benefited from an introduction by the festival's programme director Kerri Craddock, who expressed his particular enthusiasm for the website "The Hogan Family" since the late 1980s and early 1990s, where he worked for Bateman. "I did not meet too many fans "Hogan Family", the Bateman said when he entered the stage.
However, the few episodes he directed from that site brought Bateman, now 46 years old, to Directors Guild at the age of 18.
The story of his new movie has in the center a family called Fang.
Parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are artists with an average reputation, best known for the way they use their children, Annie and Baxter, in their shows, for example by putting in place a bank robbery with academia or playing the role of very weak street musicians.
At maturity, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) are trying to find their own identity.
Annie is an actress with some fame, although she is better known for public scandals than for performance, and Baxter is a novelist and journalist of magazines trying to get famous.
When Caleb and Camille disappeared in mysterious circumstances, Annie and Baxter suspected that it was just another trick of theirs and tried to discover the truth about their parents and find new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to see what the story of the children who want to evolve in adult life has reflected directly and deeply in Bateman.
"My childhood was a very atypical," Bateman confesses.
I started acting when I was 10 years old, with parents like managers, and this movie has many elements that overlap with the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story as a superficial and fun story.
"It's a story I feel connected and I understand it deeply," he added "and although I didn't try to add my personal experience to it, I knew very clearly how to show this film to represent children with a non-traditional childhood."
The project started with Kidman, and she was the producer of the film, which obtained rights for Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write his own adaptation, Lindsay-Abeire was co-opted, who adapted his own play "Treat to Reality", in which Kidman played.
Bateman testifies that he accepted the chance to drive the movie and play in it.
(Kidman, currently on stage in London in "Photograph 51" production, did not participate in the premiere of the month.
The author of the book was found in the public.)
In the Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney named Bateman's film "a smart and caustic adaptation" which "gives a lot of cliche of the disfunctioning family and tells the mission, sometimes of a life, of children to understand their parents in ways that can be fun and sweet, incisive and usually very dark".
In Variety, Justin Chang named the film "a very sharp portrait" and mentioned that Bateman "proves visible progress and a greater maturity as a film director with this structured intelligent adaptation, but never too narrow or mechanical".
After the month projection, when Bateman and Walken stepped on the stage for the question session, the audience ovated the multipute Walken.
About Bateman as director and actor, Walken said during the question session that "I was impressed every day.
I couldn't believe the ease with which he changed the work of film director, which is very difficult, and the actor in the scene.
His concentration is really amazing.
In a particular scene of dialogue, Bateman stands on a ladder in the family house behind the frame, hidden in the façade, just a shadow of the profile, while Kidman is closer to the room and sees more clearly.
It's not hard to imagine Bateman's actor talking to Bateman about the fact that he can't be seen.
"It seems incredible to me to drive movies," Bateman said.
All my decisions come from this, I never take them to benefit me as an actor.
Having a privileged position to be responsible for creating the entire public experience, not just one instrument in that orchestra, being an actor, is a whole thing.
No matter what, that... actor wants a prime plan.
During the question and answer session, Bateman testified that after reading the script, he immediately thought about Walken for the role of Caleb, but also about the composer Carter Burwell for the sound column.
Famous mainly for the long friendship with Coen brothers, Burwell has composed the sound column for two other films present at the Toronto festival: the animated film "Anomalisa" - a story about love and isolation directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Legal Gangsters", by Brian Helgeland, the interpretation of the English gangster twins of the 1960s, Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell also composed the sound column for Todd Haynes's "Carol" movie.
"The lightnings with long tones or obtuses seem very interesting to me," Bateman says, giving more explanations Tuesday.
Sail among those tones and guide the harmonious audience and something elegant from one to the next, during the film.
Carter built his career and an incredible reputation as a person who can navigate among the most complicated tones.
With “The Family Fang”, Bateman took another bold step, both director and actor, in a career dominated by reinventation and determination, a mix of comedy and drama, light and dark.
As Bateman confessed when he finished his film introduction to the world premiere of months, "Well, unfortunately, it came out exactly as I wanted."
The festival is about Oscars on the Boston Globe investigation story on pedophile priests
Did you win $240,000 on the lottery?
A ticket to X-LOTTO worth over $240,000 is unclaimed for a month.
The unregistered ticket at X-Lotto's extraction was purchased from the English Farm Shopping Centre on Montague Rd on Saturday, 15 August.
Along with the winning ticket sold in South Australia, another 16 winning entries have been registered throughout Australia, which have shared the estimated X-Lotto single premium fund of $4 million.
SA Lotteries asks all those who bought tickets to X-Lotto from England Farm Lotteries Kiosk to check them as soon as possible.
The winning numbers from the X-Lotto 3555 extraction on Saturday, 15 August, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
The additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Kath Venables, the manager of English Farm Lotteries Kiosk, says he looks forward to receiving the good news that the one who won the big prize checked the ticket to X-Lotto.
"We've been trying to spread the news from the background, because a person is our winner and doesn't have the slightest idea," she said.
Detectives from crime search the house on the street Beadell, Burton, where the man who disappeared Daniel Hind was last seen
Hind's sister Chelsea Hind said it's frustrating to wait for information about her missing brother, especially because the police offered two different versions of that trip the night she was last seen.
Her family asked the police to search her home since her brother was gone.
"I was hoping they'd look at the house, we weren't told they'd do it," she said.
Ms. Hind also says that her family also wanted those who knew what was going on with her brother to talk and tell the truth to the police.
"We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night," she said.
We're four children and we have many other family members and half of us think he's alive somewhere, and the other half think he's not.
Anyway, we want him home and end the story.
By 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 kilometers of highway
By 2022, the Bulgarian government plans to build 635 kilometres of new highways and repair 17,000 kilometres of existing main and secondary roads.
The completion of work for Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotine motorways, all of which are part of pan-European transport corridors, are among the priorities of the road infrastructure development plan approved on Wednesday.
The plan aims to create a sustainable road infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network, but also to ensure greater safety on the road and efficient road transport management, the government said.
Bulgaria is a transit country for the traffic of cultural goods in Syria
According to Interior Minister Rumyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit country for the illicit traffic of cultural goods stolen from the Middle East, due to its geographical location.
During a speech held on Wednesday at a conference on the fight against the plundering of the Syrian cultural heritage, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgaria's national legislation has been rebuilt to fit the new context, stressing the prohibition of cross-border trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian Press Agency (BTA), said that the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of the Interior, in particular the Directorate-General for the Fight against Organized Crime (GDBOP) focused on preventing the smuggling and illegal sale of Bulgarian cultural objects.
He said Bulgaria is a country with a rich history, which recent studies have placed on the third place, after Italy and Greece, in the top of the traffic of objects and cultural goods.
Bulgaria's internal minister has also shown that the trafficking of cultural objects and the destruction of historical sites in areas such as Iraq and Syria are a phenomenon that has taken on a large scale, being described as an extremely serious war crime.
He stressed the need for concerted and decisive measures to stop the intentional destruction of history.
Director General UNESCO, Irina Bokova, mentioned that films of illegal archaeological excavations in Syria demonstrate that the country is affected by industrial robbery.
Participants at the Wednesday conference acknowledged that Syria's cultural heritage is seriously endangered and that the international community must unite to stop the illegal trafficking of cultural goods in the war-stricken country.
Rockettyne Aerojet says the program for the new AR-1 engine could be modified
On Tuesday, Rocketyne Holdings Inc Aerojet announced that it is expected to complete the new AR-1 missile engine by 2019 to replace a Russian engine that will soon be banned, but the date could be changed if it does not receive sufficient funds from the US government.
Vice-President Aerojet, Julie Van Kleeck, refused to make statements about the fact that Aerojet offered $2 billion to purchase the United Launch Alliance (ULA), a mixed company with equal shares for the launch of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.
Analysts say the proposed amount is a strategic move of Aerojet to cross its rival Blue Origin, a company owned by the founder Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, who develops a new engine that ULA wants to use for its new Vulcan rocket.
ULA says the Blue Origin engine programme is about two years before the Ar-1 engine from Aerojet, an assertion that Aerojet is a contradiction.
The issue of new engines has become a priority after US legislators have approved a ban on the use of Russian RD-180 engines for the launch of U.S. military or spy satellites, following the annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region by Russia last year.
Van Kleeck claims that Aerojet test equipment hardware for the engine, which is designed with three-dimensional printed parts to fit both in the Atlas 5 rocket of the ULA, now powered by the RD-180 engine, as well as in the new Vulcan rocket that develops the ULA and costs about $1 billion.
Aerojet says it will be less expensive and less risky to integrate its engine into Atlas 5 than to develop a completely new engine and rocket, as ULA is currently planning.
Van Kleeck says that Aerojet was planning to start a wide-scale engine test in 2017, followed by obtaining the certificate in 2019, but the date could be delayed if the company does not receive sufficient funds from the Air Force in contracts expected at the end of the first half of the fiscal year 2016 beginning in October.
It further states that the whole company was impatient to see how the Air Force will share a funding of approximately USD 160 million between rival competitors.
It also says that Aerojet was planning to try other private financing options for the engine, but did not offer details.
Competition from the Air Force is a public-private partnership and each of the bidders must provide a third of the funding, and the Air Force covers two thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both of which are private companies, have self-funded the engine creation process and say that they are not looking for unresolved government funding.
AB InBev Beverage Company intends a 275 billion-dollar merger with SABMiller
Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the world's largest brewing company, approached the rival company SABMiller (SAB.L) about a takeover that would form a colossus that would produce a third of the total number of brewing in the world.
Such a merger would have a market value of approximately USD 275 billion at current prices and would combine AB InBev's dominance in Latin America with SABMiller in Africa, both representing markets with rapid development, but also with their beer factories in Asia.
"The true attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but also some places in Asia and Latin America," analyst Andrew Holland from the General Society said.
AB InBev and other top beer companies are trying to enter new markets and strengthen their weak points in North America and Europe, where consumers increasingly prefer beer produced by independent players or wine or spirit drinks.
SABMiller, a company located on the second world market and the producer of over 200 beer brands, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said on Wednesday that he was informed of AB InBev's intention to make an offer to him, which must happen by 14 October at the latest, in accordance with British law.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private capital fund managed by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the approach.
3G, renowned for its policy of reducing the cost of marketing socket, has previously orchestrated the acquisition of Burger King, the ketchup producer Heinz (KHC.O) and Kraft Foods.
An appropriate source of SAB mentioned that it is too early to say what it will do, as they have not received any offer.
"At this point, we are in the stage waiting and deciding," the source said.
Speculations on a merger, which would very likely raise concerns about the infringement of competition rules on markets such as the United States and China, have been circulating for several years.
The time to approach, after better than a decade of purchases by AB InBev, follows a decrease of approximately 15% of the price of SABMiller’s shares from August.
"It's exactly the moment they were expecting," analyst Phil Gorham from Morningstar said.
Financially, for the first time in many years, it has logic.
AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds (62 USD) for the operation of SAB Miller, perhaps even 45 pounds, according to analysts, which would mean a total price of up to USD 130 billion, which would also include the duty of SABMiller.
This would make the most significant M&A transaction in 2015, which is already a record year after the financial crisis in 2008 from the point of view of the transaction, and one of the largest acquisitions in 1980 here.
The SAB's shares amounted to 19.9% to 36.14 lire, giving it a stock exchange of $90 billion.
AB InBev shares reached 6.4%.
Rivali Heineken (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (Carlb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) suspect that SAB could seek another merger as defence strategies, as it happened in the previous year when Heineken offered to buy, but failed.
Since then, the African bottle bottler has combined refreshing drinks with Coca-Cola (KO.N), and over the past few weeks there has been a ban on a combination with Diageo or Australian Coca-Cola Amatil drinks firm (CCL.AX).
The global market share of AB InBev’s beer market, Budweiser’s producer, Stella Artois and Corona, was 21.1% in 2014, while SABMiller was 15%, according to the Plato Logic industry experts.
AB InBev intends to report between net debt and gross profit (EBITDA) of 2 times, from the present 2.5.
It is possible to achieve the objective in 2016, the closest realistic date to which the transaction could be concluded, so that it would have a way to borrow to finance a purchase.
When he bought Budweiser's company, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008 with US$ 52 billion, the biggest acquisition of ice money in history at that time. He let the report grow more than 5 times.
A rise like that would allow them to collect a debt of 100 billion.
The families that control AB InBev hold less than half of the company, while the two main shareholders from SABMiller are the tobacco producer Altria (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family in Colombia.
On Wednesday, Altria refused to make statements about the fact that AB InBev had been approached, but on 9 September, its financial director, Billy Gifford, said in an analysis conference that he regularly evaluated the investment in SABMiller and that "this time we consider the maintenance of assets to be in the interest of our shareholders".
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for statements.
Neil Dwane, head of European Investments, equity, at the Global Investors Alliance, which holds shares in both companies, says AB InBev has faced an increasing pressure to return the excess cash to shareholders.
ABI pays a very high price, but the accumulation of small debt revenues reaches about 15% somewhere.
But we believe that the profit obtained from this acquisition would be a disappointing percentage of 8% after 10 years," Dwane said.
In the case of any combination there are significant weights related to the infringement of competition rules, in particular in the United States, where companies hold approximately 70% of the beer market.
"Economys that could be done in distribution operations are large, and the penalties related to the infringement of competition rules are even greater," said Erik Gordon, professor at the Ross Business School at the University of Michigan.
Such a transaction would allow Molson Coors to obtain the 58 per cent of the company participating in SABMiller, in accordance with the operating agreement governing it.
A change of control at SABMiller would automatically grant Molson the right to obtain another 8 percent and to appoint a new executive director of the company.
Molson, based in Denver, would have the right to the first and last offer for the rest of 50 percent.
One Molson speaker refused to comment on whether the company was interested in an auction, but the Molson shares increased by more than 12 percent, at their highest value.
Any merger could also have to sell shares in China, where market leader is SABMiller's participation in CR Snow with China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or Tsingtao from China could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that, after surrenders, the combined group could hold 28% of the global market.
AB InBev is advised by Lazard, and SABMiller is advised by Robey Warshaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.
Pakistani police accuse a former Air Force pilot of helping Qaeda
Pakistani police arrested a former Air Force pilot who would have given further funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, police officers for Reuters said Wednesday, in a rare case that targets those who support financial activism.
The suspect, Syed Sheaba Ahmed, was detained in the southern town of Karachi.
It paid for the treatment of injured Taliban militants, at a hospital in eastern Lahore, the police said.
He also influenced two militants involved in another month's attack on a bus with members of the Muslim minority and Ishmaeli, after which 45 people died, said to journalists the senior police officer Naveed Khawaja from the Department of Combating Terrorism of the province.
It will be accused of financing terrorism, Khawaja said.
"Ahmed has further funded the Afghan Taliban, we are still conducting research to see if he has provided financial assistance through his business or behind him is someone else," the officer said.
"Ahmed also offered financial assistance to AQIS," said, referring to the Al Qaeda organization on the Indian subcontinent, a branch of Al Qaeda founded one year ago.
This arrest is a rare success for Pakistani police forces, facing activism, corruption and crime.
After, in December, the Taliban rifles massacred about 150 people, mostly children, at an army school, the government swore to undermine activism.
There were severe attacks, while the army also advanced more in the tribal regions outside the border with Afghanistan.
But the militant groups remain a threat and many of them flock from Pakistani cities under the control of very weak police forces and with insufficient funds.
Ahmed, 52 years of age, used to preach at a mosque in the good area of the Karachi Army Locations Authority.
His public sermons were moderate, but in particular he encouraged radicalism, the police said.
He studied at the Pakistani Air Force College in Sargodha and left Pakistani Air Force in 1998, another security officer said for Reuters under anonymity.
He later entered the chemical wax and substances industry.
Rapper Rick Ross rejected his application for copyright for "Everyday I'm Hostlin"
New York Rapper Rick Ross cannot claim copyright for the words "Everyday I'm Hostlin'," decided an American judge, refusing to complain against the music group LMFAO, who sold tricours with a similar verse, "Everyday I'm Shufflin'".
In a decision published on Tuesday by the Miami federal court, District Judge Kathleen Williams said Ross's slogan, the leading part of his early 2006 hit, "Hustlin'", is a short statement for which the courts have mentioned several times that he cannot receive copyright.
Williams' ruling weakens the process of violating the copyright of Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, attempted against LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that the Los Angeles electrotropic duo, composed of Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied "Hustlin" for their famous 2010 song "Party Rock Anthem", which contains the verse "Everyday I'm shuffle".
The hip hop star said the LMFAO song is "a clear attempt to capitalize the fame and success of the Hustlin song".
He also tried Kia Motors to use the song "Party Rock Anthem" in a advertising campaign.
In his complaint, Ross claimed that LMFAO violated his copyright by selling tricotes and other products with the sufflin slogan.
In Tuesday's ruling, Williams says "Hustlin" as a melody, is protected by copyright law.
But Ross's slogan of three words is made up of ordinary words and can't have copyright, she said.
The judge compared it to other famous music from the past, such as "you get the right one, uh-huh", "holla back" and "we get it poppin'", saying it is "a short expression, which all courts have unanimously declared as impossible to place under copyright".
The judge did not decide whether the song of the LMFAO team is an unauthorized copy of Hustlin'.
The process is scheduled for October.
Ross and LMFAO’s lawyers could not be contacted immediately for statements.
The case is William L. Roberts, II et al. v. Stefan Kendal Gordy et al, at the American District Court for Southern District, Florida, No.

Dr. Carson approaches Trump in the most recent presidential poll of the Republican Party
According to the latest presidential poll for 2016, newsman Ben Carson approached the bombing leader Donald Trump in the preliminary republican elections.
Carson got 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush went down in seven-point polls.
After Trump's 27% support in the latest CBS/New York Times poll, Carson, retired neurosurgeon, reaches second place with 23 percent, followed by Bush, the television star Mike Huckabee, Senator of Florida Marco Rubio, every 6 percent.
The support of Republicans in the preliminary elections increased from the beginning of August to the beginning of September for Trump, Carson, the governor of Ohio John Kasich and former executive director of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.
Support for the last two remains, however, to numbers of one digit.
Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida and the one leading the Bush family standards, dropped by seven percentage points in a month, while the Governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker dropped by eight points.
In the last survey, Walker's support is 2%.
Carson attracted greater support than Trump among college graduates (29% to 21%), while Trump is ahead of Carson in the preferences of non-university voters (30% to 19%).
Trump is supported more by men than women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of respondents to the poll said they were determined what candidate to support in the preliminary elections in their state.
Those who said I know who will vote with twice as much support Trump as Carson.
It is still too early to say for 63% of the Republican voters for the preliminary elections.
The results of the CBS/NYT survey conducted between 9 and 13 September will be made public on Tuesday, before a presidential debate in the Republic.
Carson's rise in this survey reflects the leadership of Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders for the nomination of the Democrats to Presidential, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The latest follow-up to the CBS presidential nominations shows that Sanders entered Iowa, New Hampshire, with 10 points and 22 points respectively, among the premier democratic voters.
A leading ethics specialist claims that sexual robots should be prohibited
A leading ethics specialist in the robotics industry launched a campaign calling for the ban on the development of sexual robots.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, a robotic expert at the University of Montfort in Leicester, England, warns that sexual robots could contribute to the systematic dehumanization of women and children.
"Sex robots seem to be an increasingly important subject in the robotics industry, and the models from which they are inspired - the way they will show, what roles they will have - are very disturbing," she told the BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sexual robots is not one against sex, but against exploitation.
Technology is not neutral.
It's inspired by class, race and gender.
Political power inspires technology development," she said for Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about it.
These robots will contribute to increasing the degree of sexual exploitation.
Although sexual robots that are now being manufactured are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that they are the first step towards something worse.
It's a new and emerging technology, but we have to stop it from the face.
Of course, the industry seems to be moving forward.
A few years ago, the True Companion, a company producing flammable dolls, launched Roxxxx, the first sexual robot in the world.
However, concern about the potential dangers posed by artificial intelligence is not unusual, even among the great representatives of industry.
Even this spring, executive director of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk, wrote about “the risk that, in five years, something really dangerous happens.
In an interview with BBC last December, physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned that "the development of a complete artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race".
British First Refugees in Syria - RT UK
The following days, Britain will receive the first refugees who fled the Syrian war, Interior Minister Theresa May announced.
They will receive assistance under the government's extended re-installation programme.
Asylum-seeking refugees arrive from camps on the border with the war-stricken country.
These are the first of the 20,000 refugees the United Kingdom plans to receive by 2020.
In a speech in the House of Commons, the Interior Minister said the government "works fast" to ensure more arrivals.
In the process of receiving vulnerable refugees in the United Kingdom, it is imperative that the assistance and support that they need and deserve are already taken into account.
I know that honourable Members and the general public want to find out more details about the number of persons and the date of their arrival.
May mentioned that the government must also make more plans to ensure that refugees have adequate provisions when they arrive.
I have to stress that the level of enlargement requires careful and thorough planning, to ensure that everything is done properly.
Me and the Syrian refugee minister Richard Harrington, we will continue to keep the camera up to date in this regard.
But I am pleased to tell the Chamber that we expect to meet the first wave of refugees in the next few days and work quickly to plan more arrivals in the coming weeks.
Prime Minister David Cameron attracted the anger of parliamentarians and militants when he revealed the government's plan for refugees, many thinking the figure was too small.
In September, Cameron said in the House of Commons that the United Kingdom "will rise to the highest moral responsibility" and receive 20,000 refugees from the camps in the Middle East to the next general elections.
He added that the refugees would not automatically receive complete asylum, but a humanitarian status that would allow them to apply for asylum after five years.
However, the critics noted that the figures meant only 12 refugees a day, and the former Liberal Democratic Liberal Paddy Ashdown said the measures were "directors".
Further, Ashdown has revealed that children included in this scheme are to be deported when they are 18 years old if they do not receive asylum.
They also condemned important public figures and seeps.
In a common letter, great names such as Benedict Cumberbach, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said the answer to the crisis is "too little, too late".
"It is a responsibility that must be shared with our European neighbours, not just thrown on the shoulders of the countries close to the conflicts that take people away from their homes," they wrote.
Rubla is headed on the global uncertainty fund - RT Business
The Russian Rubla strengthened on Wednesday, being traded with 65.66 against the US dollar and 73.98 against the euro at the Moscow Bursa at 10:00 GMT.
In general, the Russian currency won seven percent from its lowest rate of 71 rubles for a dollar on 24 August.
Analysts say that the return of the rubble was due to the investor's reaction to the current global market disturbances produced by Chinese weights, the possible increase in the US Federal Reserve's interest rate and the excessive reaction to cheap oil.
Brent's quotas increased by 61 cents on Wednesday, reaching 48.36 USD per barrel.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) has traded 72 cents more, at 45.31 USD per barrel.
OTHER MULTS: Most likely, the interest rate will increase in the USA by the end of 2015 - US Fed
"Vulnerability is possible to say the word, fuelled by uncertainty about China and by the rise in the rate of federal profits, which will continue to give rise to oil and rubble prices," said Bloomberg Piotr Matys from Rabobank, expert in monetary policy strategies on emerging markets, established in London.
Experts also indicate another factor that explains the strengthening of the Russian currency.
The main Russian oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft, whose contracts are related to the US dollar, began to buy rubles.
The global markets await with the soul at the mouth the Federal Reserve's decision of Thursday, whether it will increase or not the interest rate.
The markets do not consider that what could be the first growth in the nine-year US interest rate and traded at higher Wednesdays.
Nasa and the United Kingdom work together on the drone traffic system
NASA is already working with the U.S. government and with companies such as Google, Amazon and the Verizon telephone company to develop a database that allows drone pilots to reserve airspace blocks for flights.
Nothing has yet to be established at EU level.
The collaboration comes as a result of a very common non-linear with regard to the possibility of an air collision between small drones and commercial aircraft.
A new Forrester report describes the potential negative effect in the colours.
"Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies by delivering products or catching data in urban areas with high density, such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco," the research says.
Without a common set of technological protocols and air rules, chaos could be installed.
According to this O'Cathain, Baroness of the House of Lords, concern has been amplified on the background of the reports on events at the limit of the production of an accident and the operation of drones over football stadiums, near nuclear power stations and the Eiffel Tower.
"In the last two years, more than 400 calls to the Metropolitan Police have been linked to drone incidents," O'Cathain said.
What is the solution: to build a system that follows all drones, especially those flying at a height of less than 150 metres, whether driven by commercial or amateur pilots.
"As small drones increasingly operate commercial flights at low altitude, beyond the pilot's visibility level, or even completely autonomous flights, there is a need for some air traffic management infrastructure to separate flights, in order to ensure the safety of complex operations, such as the delivery of urban harvests," she said.
According to NASA, this drone traffic management system will include services such as air space design, methods to avoid unfavourable weather conditions and wind, congestion management, route planning and redirecting by similar methods with rules for road traffic, such as signs and bands.
They are expected to have a functional prototype by 2019.
The drone industry is going to explode in the European Union over the next few years.
"We already see small and innovative SMEs in the UK using this technology with significant effects in the energy, agriculture and the media industries," says Lord Tariq.
Only 670 licences for commercial drone operations were granted in the United Kingdom by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014.
The European Commission estimates that the drone industry could generate 150 000 jobs in the EU by 2050.
Dislike button: why does Facebook want to know what it says to you?
"A Look Back" works similarly, gathering the most important moments (on Facebook).
But what will this mean for many users within the virtual Facebook borders, who are now more than the population of any country?
First of all, of course, a empathy button will allow Facebook to understand you better.
The huge value of Facebook - about 240 billion USD after last statistics - is due to the unimaginable amount of data about the consumers it holds.
Every interaction, postage, appreciation and friendship you make are gathered and build a remarkable picture of a complex, in a permanent update, about your person and the preferences you have.
This is valuable in the first place for advertising agencies, who can use all this information to carefully choose what people see on Facebook ads, selecting those who are most interested in their products.
An empathy button adds another set of data and, of course, opens a door for another type of advertising agent to use the platform.
While a sports company is looking for people who "appreciate" a national football team, charitable organisations and promoters want to address those who, for example, "empathize" with the refugee crisis.
It will also probably change what you see in News.
Facebook uses incredibly intelligent and sophisticated algorithms to restrict that vast universe of content that you could see, in the smaller stream that you actually see.
This algorithm depends essentially on what you considered interesting in the past and, above all, on what you liked.
There is no doubt that there are many interesting posts on Facebook, but unhappy ones do not enter the algorithm, because people don't feel that they should be appreciated.
However, if Facebook understands more about what upsets you or makes you feel unhappy, it might decide to remove this kind of news item.
Facebook has conducted experiments in the past to understand how what you see in News affects your emotional state and, above all, how this is transmitted from one person to another.
The academic environment representatives call this "emotional contamination" and, although it sounds bad, it is probably just a simple trial of Facebook (and published, with their agreement) to better understand how their platform works and whether they can adjust the algorithms to distribute more elements.
What's going to happen with the empathy button stays at Facebook's latitude.
The real challenge is how the decision of a single company to add a single button to its services can produce so much speculation.
The reason for this may be that the decisions made by Facebook - whether it involves the visible buttons that we see or the invisible algorithms that work hidden - have profound consequences on us today.
Now we spend a significant part of our life in the digital world, which we access to find anything, from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and still a constant struggle for survival in the ferocious Darwinian world of social technology and networks.
The decisions it takes, including with regard to the new buttons, will be the most appropriate ones to remain on the surface in this course.
I think a lot of people can empathize with this and soon they'll have a button for this.
Biometric hugs can anticipate crises in people with autism
In the course of ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team have established that body signals can anticipate these changes, sometimes violent, before they occur, giving assistants the opportunity to take appropriate measures.
The autism kids we work with can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say that his head hurts or that "here's too much noise" or "I don't like this teacher."
If we want to understand them, we need to see what their body transmits, and we need to do this in a mild and unintrusive way.
For example, simple color viewing in an application can show the level of agitation. The red can be used to warn about a change of behavior, and blue for lack of interest, giving the assistant understanding that the person is tired and needs stimulation.
Data from the brochures can be collected in time and saved on a secure server, helping caregivers to understand the overall picture of how the person responds to various situations and which would be the most appropriate intervention.
I have to say very clearly that we don't read the mind.
Biometric sensors are not magic. They need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team will work with producers to further develop this technology, to be specific to autism.
The research was appreciated by Jane Carolan, director of services for customers from the Wirral Autistic Society, who will present technology at the Autech 2015 conference on autism and technology from Manchester on 1 October.
When you work with people who suffer from severe autism, as we do, you see the spectacular difference that can bring in the quality of their lives the assistance technology. Now, the apps for iPad give a voice to people who have never spoken.
Robots help the autistic kids learn to play hiding.
"Who knows where this innovation could lead us," she says.
Assistance technologies can really change life and we feel that they are part of our mission, as a charity for autism, to ensure that everyone has access to this information and they are also part of the discussion of how we want to support people with autism in the future.
France will attack Isis in Syria "in the coming weeks"
In the following weeks, French warplanes will launch air attacks on the targets of Isis in Syria, announced the government on Wednesday, just a few days after President François Hollande said the intervention was a "necessary".
France will launch the first air attacks on the jihadist group Islamic State in Syria "in the coming weeks", Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Wednesday.
French air forces are conducting reconnaissance missions in Syria on 8 September, and the attacks will follow "in the coming weeks as soon as we have clearly identified targets," Le Drian said for France Inter radio station.
Le Drian said in parliament on Tuesday that the Islamic State made "very significant progress" in Syria, especially in the northern region of Aleppo.
"In the town of the Great there is an extremely strong offensive, and if it succeeds, it could destroy what we still call the Syrian Free Army or the Syrian national coalition or what remains of it," he said.
France is part of a U.S.-led coalition, which bombed the Isis positions in Iraq for one year, but the Netherlands changed its strategy last week to extend its actions in Syria, under the conditions of political pressure it accumulates on the basis of the jihadist threat facing France.
The United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the Gulf States have already been involved in attacks on the Isis militants in Syria.
Blocking feature of iOS 9 ads will make the phone even faster
The latest version of iOS 9 launches Wednesday and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners - and worrying for online editors - is the ability to easily block ads during web browsing.
The new feature will allow users to download third-party extensions that block cookies, ads, pop-up windows and other types of advertising during the use of the Safari mobile browser version from Apple.
In the test, it was proved that, after blocking the ads, news sites such as the New York Times are loaded twice as fast, according to Reuters.
The blocking of advertisements also helps users to preserve their data usage and battery autonomy.
Users will benefit from multiple advertising blocking options, including 1Blocker, Blockr and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular desktop block tool, launched its own iOS web browser that limits ads; its creator intends to launch an extension for Safari in the future.
People using software blocking programs happen a few constraints.
Advertisements are still displayed in applications (this is where Apple wins money on iOS).
More media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, try to prevent visitors from using such blocking features.
However, their level of use on desktop computers increased to almost 48% in the previous year.
Their development raises great challenges for online media, which is largely offered to consumers free of charge and is supported for many years by advertising.
One report says that blocking ads could cost online editors nearly 22 billion in advertising revenues only this year.
To enable the blocking of ads in iOS 9, users must download an application for blocking ads, then access Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to activate an extension for blocking content.
Obama talks about terrorism and the crisis of immigrants with the king of Spain
President Barack Obama happened to King Felipe VI of Spain on Tuesday at the White House, where the two discussed various subjects, but which were probably reduced to the importance of international cooperation.
Obama and the kings have addressed the issue of the fight against the Islamic State and the growing crisis of immigrants in Europe - which already faces hundreds of thousands of people who have left their country of origin to go west.
"Spain has worked very hard to deal with this problem in the past, with North African immigrants who are often involved in very dangerous journeys, and the problems of human trafficking," Obama said.
Of course, the problem has worsened in the last few months.
Obama also stressed the importance of cooperation, especially in the context of the Spanish territory of Catalonia voting in elections to take place this month.
"As regards foreign policy, we have firmly committed ourselves to maintaining relations with a strong and united Spain," Obama said.
The supreme commander told King Felipe that he would like to visit the country before the end of his mandate in 2017.
"We welcome you with open arms," answered Felipe.
The first lady, Michelle Obama, made the queen a tour of the White House and had a discussion at tea.
That was the first visit of the royal couple in the United States of America from the throne.
After they left Washington, they were going to visit South Florida.

Also, Jessica Jones and Iron Fist will soon be broadcast, but also the second season in Daredevil.
"Scream Queens" and "Empire" have the world premiere on the same day
Fox foresees many positive results before the premieres of two of his most expected series: Scream Queens and Empire.
The first season in Queens and the second in Empire will be broadcast on all Fox International channels one day after the internal premiere.
As Variety reports, the strategy is a trend applied to high-profile series, as global social networks traffic guarantees success.
"Hollywood realizes how important it is to value the common voice of sincere international fans, especially for the series that is very much discussed, such as Empire and Screen Queens," said the president of Fox International, Hernan Lopez, according to Deadline.
"We are looking forward to broadcasting these very interesting series for fans from around the world," Lopez continued.
The viewers we serve every day bring the success of a show to the premiere and throughout his life cycle.
The next season in Empire, in which they will play famous seeings such as Mariah Carey and Vivica A. Fox, has the premiere in September.
The new Scream Queens series, in which Emma Roberts and Ariana Grande will play, will be broadcast on the second day in September.
Members of the British royal family will participate in the world premiere of the movie "Spectre"
Prince Harry and Dukes and Dukes of Cambridge will participate next month in London at the world's most recent film premiere with James Bond, "Spectre".
The Kensington Palace announced the news on Twitter Wednesday, appointing the premiere as the Royal Film Performance for the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.
According to a press release by producers, "Spectre" is the third Bond film selected as the 1946 RFP here.
In the past, the prizes have been selected and "Don't Die Today" (2002) and Casino Royale (2006).

Director Sam Mendes and producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson will also go on the red carpet with members of the royal family.
"Spectre" will be broadcast in US cinemas in November.
There are rumors that Christie Brinkley and John Mellencamp would be together
The Christie Brinkley model and the musician John Mellencamp were seen taking dinner together for months, skating the rumor that the two would have a romantic relationship.
The two met to have dinner at the Bowery Hotel in New York City, where the photos surprised the happy and smiling Brinkley.
The 61-year-old supermodel was seen wearing clubs, tennis and a yellow jacket, while the 63-year-old rock star was dressed in broken clubs, pallets and boots.
Last year, in October, Mellencamp would have been seen again with his girlfriend, whom he separates from and with whom he is constantly at peace, the actress Meg Ryan.
Mellencamp praised the Message star for you at Today's NBC show, saying it was "an angel who sent me and I am very happy".
He added that "nothing ends until it ends".
In August, Brinkley's youngest daughter, Sailor Brinkley Cook, took pictures of the Seventeen magazine, walking on her mother's tracks.
The kings of arctic captivity are large enough to capture a caribou
Many studies have highlighted species that have become more vulnerable due to the increasingly warm climate, but global warming has proved to be a blessing for others.
One of these advantages is the Arctic port.
According to researchers from Dartmouth College, the warmest temperatures in the Arctic region have allowed the prisoners here to appear earlier and grow larger, leading to the development of their population.
In a new study, researchers from the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth, experts in the Arctic region, used the ground observations to illustrate the effects of temperature changes on Arctic dams.
Their analysis anticipates an increase of 50% of the survival rate of adult infants in the condition of an increase of 2 degrees Celsius.
The tensions are small, but they are important members of the Arctic trophic chain and of the ecosystem.
The new analysis - detailed in a new work published in Procedures of the Royal Society B - aims to help biology better anticipate how a growing population of prisoners might affect the caribou with which they feed, the birds and insects that feed with them and the plants that they pollinate.
In order to build their demonstration, scientists from Dartmouth combined the results from the field with the results of laboratory experiments that have researched how the temperature influences the development of the insect and the predisposition to be hunted by predators.
Although the increase in temperature makes the larger prisoners more vulnerable to coleopters, it also offers them a temporary start in spring and makes the development of their larvae faster and more efficient, which certainly represents an advantage.
Several births mean a larger population, which can only be developed to the extent that they can support the food sources of insects.
The ability of citizens to transform their improved survival rate into an improved breeding rate depends on their ability to provide their blood for food.
Antidepressants taken during pregnancy do not affect the child
Three new studies have shown that the administration of antidepressants to pregnant women has no effect on the development of their children's neuronal or behavioral development.
Studies have shown that selective serotonin recovery inhibitors (SSRIs) present an increased risk of postpartum bleeding, but researchers have claimed that depression is a higher risk for women and children, therefore it is necessary to be treated.
"This study adds a growing set of evidence on the safety of the administration of antidepressants during pregnancy," said John Thorp in a press release, deputy editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, who published all three studies.
Although there are some increased risks, the evidence so far seems to show that the risks of untreated depression are greater than those raised by the administration of antidepressants.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health has coordinated a study on the development of the motor of children whose mothers have been treated with SSRI, analysing the data of 51 404 children in the Norwegian mother and child cohort study, examining the effects of using SSRI for the development of the motor capacity at the age of 3.
Researchers found that 381 mothers used SSRI during pregnancy, and 159 of them treated drugs for an extended period.
Although exposure to SSRI was associated to some extent with a delay in engine development, researchers wrote in the study that the association "was not so significant as to give the delay a clinical significance".
A group of researchers from Adelaide University of Australia conducted a data review for 49,000 Danish birth cohort women to discover the effects of SSRI administration on the behaviour of children up to the age of 7.
The study found that untreated depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems.
There was no increased risk of behavioural problems in 210 children whose mothers were treated with SSRI depression compared to 231 children who were more predisposed to behavioral problems such as hyperactivity, lack of attention and socialization.
The same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more predisposed to blood after birth if treated with SSRI.
Analysis of medical data from 30 198 who were born at a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 showed that the risk of postnatal bleeding increased by 5%, between 11-16%, if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe bleeding or postnatal anaemia has doubled, researchers reported.
Researchers said that although the study has linked the administration of SSRI with increased risk, there are a large number of variables - from medications taken during birth to the limited amount of information received by researchers on the specific medical conditions of women - that could have had an effect on the potential for bleeding.
"It is possible that women who have taken antidepressants at an advanced stage of pregnancy have been those with the most severe stage of the disease, and this is the reason for the increased risk of postnatal, non-antidepressive bleeding," says Dr. Luke Grzeskowiak, professor at Adelaide University.
On the basis of this study, we do not recommend that women stop drug treatment against depression during pregnancy, but that they be monitored closely to minimise the risk of potential bleeding.
Matthew is charged with murder in the case of the murder of a student at Virginia Technical University.
The man accused of killing a student at the University of Virginia was charged with a qualified murder in the case of a student at the University of Virginia missing in 2009, the authorities announced Tuesday.
The great jury in Albemarle, Virginia, accused Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr. on Friday at the age of 33 from Charlottesville to kill Morgan Harrington, officials say.
Matthew is also accused of being kidnapped with the intention of rape.
Each accused head receives the maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
Harrington, 20 years old, disappeared from a concert in Charlottesville in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Their parents say the news of the prosecution brought them relief.
"For six years we have been working resolutely and unbiased for this purpose," says Gil Harrington, Morgan's mother.
I'm glad to know that when you take someone's life, you have to bear the consequences for what you do.
For Jesse Matthew, the dominoes of the consequences began to sit down.
The police say there is a legal link between Harrington, Graham and a sexual abuse in 2005 in Fairfax County.
In June, Matthew was found guilty of this and waited for the feeling in this case.
He's staying in prison in Charlottesville.
Jesse Matthew accused of murder in the case of the death of a student at the University of Virginia
Harrington went to U-Va. on October 17th. 2009, together with friends, to a Metallica concert.
The group separated when Harrington came out of John Paul Jones Arena from Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and couldn't come back.
She was last seen trying to take a cab around 8:30 in front of the arena.
Harrington was wearing a black shirt with Pantera.
After her disappearance, Harrington's bag and mobile phone were found in the arena parking lot.
The family and friends began an extensive search of Harrington, a graduate of pedagogical studies, who wanted to become a teacher. Metallica people wrote about her disappearance on their website.
In November 2009, the shirt she wore was found next to a set of apartments in Charlottesville.
Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in an isolated chain, in a farm south-west of Charlottesville.
In the period of Harrington's disappearance, Matthew worked as a taxi driver in Charlottesville, but it's not clear if that period was over when Harrington disappeared.
Police say a significant advance in the Harrington case was represented by Matthew's arrest in the event of Graham's disappearance last year.
Officials who knew the investigation said that these cases were linked by DNA evidence.
The investigators did not immediately publish the details of the new evidence that led to Matthew's being accused of murdering Harrington.
Defense attorney Douglas Ramseur, representing Matthew in Graham's case, refused to make statements.
The announcement of the prosecution comes two days after a year of Hannah Graham's disappearance in September.
This case is similar to the Harrington case: they were both young students who disappeared when they left town in Charlottesville.
Graham, 18 years old, from Fairfax County, was seen walking with Matthew in a mall in the center near the U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for that case a few weeks later, after a national search.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be tried for qualified murder in Graham's case.
In the first days after Graham's disappearance last autumn in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington represented a constant presence at meetings and views organised for the missing student from U-Va.
Harrington says he endured for her daughter speculation and criticism in the media that needs to be reduced to silence by the new charges against Matthew.
"In all this time there have been discussions of the kind "Why was it short-lived?" and "And look for it with the candle?" but this kind of questions and judgment are not valid when it is clear that we have to deal with a predator on the trail of hunting," Harrington added.
In the case of Fairfax County, Matthew was sentenced to sexual assault against a youth in 2005.
The woman, who was 26 at the time of the attack, told the jury that, on a September night, while she was returning home from the store, a stranger came behind her.
She took her to a veritable area, beat her and strung her throat, and then attacked her sexually.
"I thought my end had come, that I had to scream all the time," the woman testified.
I was afraid I'd die.
Matthew took a quick run, the woman said.
A prosecutor told the jury that Matthew might have been afraid of the lights of a car entering a nearby parking lot.
He was sentenced years later, after DNA tests linked him to this case.
Matthew's gonna get the feeling in October.
Matthew will come to trial for the first time in Harrington's Charlottesville on Wednesday afternoon.
Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, said that the most likely will come to Charlottesville on Wednesday and visit the bridge where his daughter was last seen.
"At least today we've taken a step," says Dan Harrington.

In an interview with the Dutch magazine Humo, he said he knows what duration the contract has or with the HBO, according to Digital Spy.

But one thing is certain.
"When I leave the Games of Thrones, then it will be the time when I'll be stuck in long-term films," the actor said.
The show returns to small screens in the spring of next year.

Good news for Romania from the European Commission
The European Commission decided on Tuesday to resume payments for Romania under the "Economic Competitiveness" and "Media" programmes, both interrupted at the beginning of April 2015.
According to a Communication from the representative of Romania of the European Commission, after this Decision, approximately 120 million euros will be transferred to the Roman authorities in the immediate next period.
I am pleased to announce the closure of these payments and I appreciate the efforts made by the Roman authorities to improve management and control systems within the two programmes.
It is important that the Roman authorities have been involved in identifying weaknesses and solving problems.
"I hope that the measures will significantly reduce the risk of errors and irregularities in the future," said European Commissioner for Regional Policy Corina Cretu.
"The extremist statements made by Mr. Gianni Pitella are incorrect," the chief of Hungarian diplomacy responded.
Peter Szijarto asked European socialists to stop the "false campaign" at the address of Hungary.
Referring to the statements made by Harlem Desire, the French Secretary of State for European Affairs, on the guard built by Hungary, Szijarto stressed that Budapest "supports a common European immigration strategy", insisting that national borders should be protected.

Refugee Crisis: I'll have no solution.
European Council President Donald Tusk announced that Thursday will take a decision on the possible convening of a European Union summit on migration in Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and counterpart Werner Faymann asked Tuesday to organise a European Union summit to resolve the refugee crisis.
At a joint press conference in Berlin, Merkel said that Germany, Austria and Sweden cannot manage the refugee crisis alone.
The German executive chief expressed support for the recent decision taken by Berlin to impose border controls on the massive flow of asylum seekers, mentioning that the measure aims to facilitate the registration of refugees.
On the other hand, Slovakia - which opposes the European Commission's proposals for redistribution of refugees among Member States on the basis of mandatory quotas - has decided to organise an extraordinary EU summit.
The EU Interior Ministers, meeting in Brussels last month, failed to adopt a new proposal for an urgent redeployment of 120,000 refugees among the Member States of the European Union, presented on 9 September by the European Commission.
The first point of the plan, represented by the urgent resettlement mechanism for refugees, provides for the rapid redeployment of 54,000 refugees in Hungary, 50,400 in Greece and 15,500 in Italy.
Charlie Hebdo, new controversial cartridges
The French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo once again raised controversy, after publishing cartoons that undermine the response of the ruling Christian European countries to the wave of immigrants from the ruling Muslim lands affected by riots.
In the most recent issue or publication has attracted attention again, as well as critics on social networks, the Reuters agency writes.
One of the paintings highlights a fascinating image of Aylan Kurdi, the angry Syrian boy, whose body arrived on one of the beaches in Turkey, after an exhausted attempt to cross the sea with the boat, by his family, from Syria to Greece.
Charlie Hebdo's drawing shows a kid in short pants and shirts, with the girl down on the back of the sea, next to a advertising panel that offers two menus for children at the price of one.
"So close to success," is the message that follows the drawing.
Another drawing, also the work of a cartoonist who survived the attack from the Paris editorial headquarters in January, is accompanied by the message "God as Europe is a Christian".
The drawing presents a character like Jesus, who goes to the water, while a smaller character wears short pants with his feet up in the water, the first saying "Christians go to the water", takes the second "Muslim children get angry".
The French magazine became a symbol of freedom of expression, after it was marked by an attack of Islamist militants in January, as a result of repeated threats after the beating of the prophet Mohammed.
A chain of supermarkets present in Romania, dramatically threatened in Russia
Auchan's French supermarket chain was amended with more than $370,000 by Russian officials, being accused of food security intruders.
Anna Popova, head of the Russian Consumer Protection Agency Rosprenadzor, said that the amnesty totalises over 25 million rubles, i.e. $372.000, relates the Associated Press agency, quoted by the US News.
There were no reasons why these threats were granted, and Auchan did not comment.
The French chain of supermarkets is also the ink of the accusations of the Russian Agriculture Agency, which argues that some meat products have been found to be infected with bacteria such as E.coli and Listeria.
Food controls come within a period of tension between France and Russia on the extension of the European Union sanctions and the decision of France to cancel an understanding on the supply of Russian Mistral ships.
The Roman Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the news that Hungary could raise a metallic guard at the border with our country.
MAE appears to have been briefed on this decision and that it is not a right political gesture.
MAE shows, in a communiqué sent to Ziare.com, that it was informed by the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this intention shortly before it was announced to the public.
At the same time, the MAE informed the relevant decision-making factors in Romania in relation to this situation in good time.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that raising a guard between two Member States of the European Union and which are strategic partners is not a political right gesture, in accordance with the European spirit.
This position has already been communicated to the Hungarian party, it appears in the communication.
Hungary plans to build a metallic guard on a border segment with Romania, in the context of the immigration crisis, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto, quoted by Mediafax, said Tuesday.
"The measure is necessary in order for trafficking in persons transiting Serbia to change its routes, there is a likelihood of moving towards Romania," the Hungarian diplomat chief explained.
"The guard would start from the border point between Hungary/Serbia/Romania and continue on a reasonable distance if the migration pressure shifts to Romania," Szijarto explained.
At the end of August, the press reported that extra-Community immigrants crossing the Serbian territory on their way to the European Union were trying to bypass the guard built by the Hungarian authorities through its eastern end, at the common border between Serbia, Hungary and Romania.
In this context, extra-Community immigrants have discovered that they can relax the fence through the Majdan/Rade area (Serbia) - Baby Veche (Timis, Romania) - Kubekhaza (Hungary).
The government of Hungary has allocated 22.2 billion forts (EUR 71.8 million) to build a controversial metallic guard on the border with Serbia, at a distance of 175 kilometres, and for special centres needed for immigrants.
The Guard initiative is criticised by the European Union and Serbia.
No need, he'll stay there.
The letter with the unsuspecting body of Cornelius Vadim Tudor will not be deposited in the Senate of Romania, despite his will in this sense experiential by the politician's leader.
According to a communication submitted by Ziare.com, the Permanent Senate Bureau held a request by Don Vadim Tudor on Tuesday concerning the approval of the uninsulted body of former Senator Cornelius Vadim Tudor at the Senate headquarters.
"From the receipt of this letter until the time of analysis, in the Permanent Bureau, the uninsulted body has already been deposited at a cult lake and will remain there, the Permanent Bureau being grateful that it no longer needs to be moved from there to the Senate of Romania," the Senate said.
Senator PNL Teodor Atanasiu argued that this request "is not in line with Romania's geographical position somewhere in Europe".
Also transmitted by Agerpres, senators held a moment of recollection of former PRM leader, at the proposal of UNPR Senator Serban Mihailescu.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor died at 6:30 p.m. on Monday night.
The president of the PRM went to the Emergency Centre for Cardiovascular Cardiovascular Diseases of the Army.

Are refugees coming to Romania?
Primary of the granite sites, asked about the accommodation
The mayors of Arad's border areas are questioned by the Border Police and Police, these days, about the housing sites for refugees who might arrive in Romania, but also for Jandarmi, where they will be mobilized at the border.
The town of Nadlac, Vasile Ciceac, said he had meetings on this subject.
Discussions were conducted with farmers in the area, and they were asked to report on the presence of any foreigners near the border.
We had discussions with border police, national police and local police, but also with farmers in the area.
We all need to be more vigilant in the next period.
"I have asked the farmers, who have worked in this period on arable land, to be careful and report any movement," the idea said.
Immigrants' Crisis Gives The Clock in Hungary: Blinds and Water Tunes on the Granite
It, like other mayors in the border area with Hungary, said that the police had requested information on the accommodation available in the event of a wave of refugees.
We were asked how many people we can hunt.
We don't have room for refugees in the community.
We believe that such special centres must not even appear at the border, because they are more difficult to control here, migrants are tempted to flee, because they are not interested in staying in Romania.
It would be best to establish such centres in more remote areas of the border," said the mayor of Iratosu, Papp Atila Iosif.
On the other hand, the mayor of the Dorobanti municipality, Vincentiu Almasi, said that he had been asked about accommodation for refugees, as well as for the intervention forces, in case they would be mobilized in the area.
The police were wondering if we could make the case.
We could find places on the Cultural Path, but for refugees we have no possibility of accommodation.
"I have been asked about the length of the border with Hungary, probably working on an action plan," said Vincento Almasi.
He added that at the local police post, "starting on Tuesday, when Hungary sealed its border with Serbia, it was established permanently".
"There is always a police officer at the post, and locals know that they have to inform if they see any stranger in the area," the idea said.
Primarily Pilu's representatives said that they could have at least one hundred people on the Cultural Path, providing the information to the police, at their request.
The mayor of Curtici, Nicolae Aanitei, also said that there are accommodation spaces in the former headquarters of local public finances, but threats are needed here.
A former border police barracks could also be threatened to host refugees.
The representatives of the Jewish Police Press Office Arad did not offer a view on the question of primarys during this period, only confirming that "the patrol activities were intensified at the Arad border sites".
Commander of the Army Club announces radical measures against Becali's Star
The commander of the Army Sports Club, Colonel George Boroi, announced a series of radical measures that will be taken against Gigi Becali's Star.
Even though the two parties have negotiated an impasse, Boroi argues that the Army will have its own football team, which will take over the historic palmares of the "ros-albastrels".
The team that won the Cup of Champions is on their way out.
"It's not a historical break, it's just a competitive break, because we don't have a team, but things can change from next year," said Boroi at Sport.ro.
At the same time, he announced that the process of requesting damage from Becali's team will continue.
The period we refer to through the ICCJ decision is very clear.
We had to recover the damage from FC Steaua, the team that used the Steaua brand without the owner's acceptance - CSA Steaua.
It appears very clearly and the continuity of the section, which in fact was permanent of the Army Club.
"So the Steaua Bucharest football team, in one form or another, but in one legal form, must exist as a continuation of the professionals it has so far in palmares," George Boroi says.
Becali's star and the Army Club are in an open war since the end of last year, when the Supreme Court decided that the military are the ones that own the "Steaua".

According to this document, in 2015, the accumulated assets of the millionaires in Asia Pacific will exceed the total of $15,800 billion registered in 2014, as well as the assets of the millionaires in North America, which currently represent the richest people in the world, with a accumulated assets of $16,200 billion, transmitted by the AFP.
The study states that the Asia Pacific region already has the largest number of very rich people, named in the High Net Worth Individuals financial jargon, HNWI, with 4.69 million such individuals in 2014, with 4.68 million in North America.
HNWI are the people who can invest at least one million dollars, without taking into account the value of real estate and other properties.

"Dorel" mounted the back of the semafort
In Suceava, the workers mounted a semi-trailer with the top down, so instead of being taught to wait for 4 seconds, the passersby receive the message "h", which I don't know how to decrypt.
Don't worry, however everyone passes on the red, reports the Truth.
Each one passes through the way he cuts his head.
Two guys were to be taken up by a car because they passed on the red.
"The Routiera politicians should be here to help, until the world is used," said a woman to the quoted source.
The Semafor was recently mounted in front of the Piete Mari in the center of Sucevei, but the passersby do not seem willing to take it into account, as much as the information received seems to be incomprehensible.
After 6 comes 8, followed by an L, instead of the 9-8-7 series.
If "Dorel" did his job properly and someone was found responsible enough to give the ok to finish the job, then it would not have come to this absurd situation.
The Head of Administration Strazi and Systematisation Road in the Suceava Primary recognizes that it was the girl when the traffic light started to work, but did not realize that something was wrong.
We put them in use, but we didn't realize it was a mistake.
"Even I was the girl when they were put into operation," said Stefan Vasincu, promising that the problem would be resolved in the shortest time.
Praise the Lord that it can be remedied, because there are situations in which "Dorel" has made irreparable ravages.
For example, when he worked at the Giurgiu-Ruse gas station, "Dorel" missed out-of-the-way that knew the tunnel under the Danube, he did not know where, probably under the ground, the impromptu, however he had not been found, after even supported the Minister of Economy, Mihai Tudose.
Police put the water barrels on immigrants
On the main border of Hungary and Serbia, the Hungarian border has been used, Wednesdays, water tunnels and tear gas against immigrants.
Although Hungary closed the border with a gimpata sarma guard and introduced harsh measures against illegal immigrants, including the arrest, to the sarbo-ungara border continued to gather refugees, The Guardian writes.
The water tunnels were put into operation when the immigrants managed to patrol through the sarma gimpata through the crossing point at the Roszke border.
Hungarian police support that the action of the tuna was a control measure of the crowd, which throws water bottles.
There are no reports of possible injuries, but some people were crying after the use of tear gas.
The publication Elena Enikos writes at the same time that two German companies refuse to deliver the sarma gimpata of Hungary.
Tara has already raised the fence to the border with Serbia and Tuesday announced her intention to raise one and to the border with Romania, a strong initiative criticised in Bucharest.
German companies maintain that gimpata sarma is very dangerous and causes cuts that can be infected.
It is used to secure prisoners or military installations, but it should not be used against people seeking shelter, supporting companies.
In parallel with the Hungarian border confrontations, Croatia has mobilized to make it available to bus immigrants to transport those present at the country border with Serbia.
The Croatian Ministry of the Interior confirmed that the buses were sent to the border to take immigrants to reception centres.
373 people entered Croatia between Serbia, of which 73 children, the Ministry showed more.
Tsipras, on Greece's drama - why it agrees with the third EU agreement
The declared purpose of former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was to save the country from more austerity and to fundamentally change its relationship with EU management in Brussels.
Finally, the Syrian leader made Greece part of a third loan agreement for this country, which also involves more years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews, who conducts an interview with it.
Now, however, Tsipras calls on the Greeks to reinstate their prime minister's mandate, in some elections that he argues will bring his political position back to him.
Our aim was to get an agreement, not a exit from the euro area or a demise of the euro area.
"Now, for the first time, remains the possibility of restructuring the debt for Greece," the former prime minister said.
Now, we have an agreement that can be described as a strict one.
"But I knew from the beginning that any compromise would have been concluded in the form of an agreement," Tsipras added.
It is of the opinion that the financing part of the agreement is a great success for the Elen government, stating that all the financial needs of the country are covered by 2019.
"Alexis Tsipras also says that Greece "is definitely in need of reform," stating that it must start with state reform.
Tsipras announced his resignation on 27 August, thus opening the way for early elections in September, after 7 stormy months in front of the Athens Executive, during which a third rescue loan was approved for Greece.
He picked himself with a broken neck and burned the grade one after he exploded in front of his electronic cigarette.
A 23-year-old man in Georgia suffered fires of one degree, fracture to the throat and to a finger and a hole like a coin in the sky, after an electronic cigarette that smoke exploded in the face.
James Lauria took a short break from smoking at work, when the accident occurred after a week's stay in the hospital for intensive therapy, writes The Daily Mail.
Lauria, who was connected to a breathing device, suffered also burns in her hands and horns and a tooth from the girl entered her throat.
I was at work and things calmed down and I went out for a second, as I always do.
"On the contrary, it exploded and I was on my way to the hospital in an ambulance, that's the last thing I remember," said Lauria.
Six weeks after the accident, Lauria still can't swallow solid food and follow a liquid diet as she recovers from her parents' home.
The electronic cigarette that caused man’s injuries is in the custody of the authorities, which conducts an investigation into the incident.

Activist from Star Trek, in prison because he undressed in front of some kids
Actrita Jennifer Lien, known from Star Trek, where he played for three seasons, intrusing Kes, was arrested for inadvertent exposure to children.
The incident that led her to prison, where she was from September 3rd - the claim was set at $2,500 - and took place in front of her home in Tennessee.
The Vedette started arguing with a neighbor, Carey Smith, because of one of her crying children, Mirror reported.

When the police came, Jennifer refused to dress.
Moreover, it threatened to kill the cops and was driven with the force to the car.
It's not the first time the actress in the age of 41 has problems with the police; in April, she was also arrested, then guilty of assault.

Stop supporting terrorism!
Syrian President Bashar of Assad has given a rare interview to the Russian press, speaking about refugees and accusing the West of supporting terrorists and "in sight" immigrants.
"The West weeps for them and the West sustains terrorists from the beginning of the crisis, when it says it is a passionate revolution," Assad said in an interview given by Russia Today.
The leader of Damascus argues that his Western homologies say about the situation in Syria that he is a terrorist like the Islamic State, "but because of the Syrian state or the Syrian regime or the Syrian president".
As long as this propaganda follows, there will be more refugees.
So it's not about the fact that Europe didn't accept them, or that it didn't embellish them as refugees, it's about not treating the cause.
If you're worried about them, don't back the terrorists.
That's what we believe about the crisis.
"This is the core of the whole refugee issue," the Syrian leader added.
Assad continued the charges to the Western states and as regards the treatment they show to the refugee girl.
It's like the West now cries for refugees with an eye and takes them in a vision with a second eye, because those refugees actually left Syria because of terrorism, in principle because of terrorists and crimes, and in the second round because of the results of terrorism.
"When you have terrorism and destroy infrastructure, you will not have the basic living resources, so many people leave because of terrorism and because they want to cast their existence somewhere in this world," Bashar Al Assad says.
"If we were to ask any Syrian today what he wants, the first thing he would say would be 'We want security and security for every person and every family'," the Syrian president stressed, adding that he is political, whether he is inside or outside the government, "we should join around what the Syrian people want."
The President of Syria is of the opinion that the country's dialogue should continue "to reach a consensus", which cannot be implemented "unless we break terrorism in Syria".
"I would like to take this opportunity to ask all the forces to join against terrorism, because it is how we, as Syrians, can achieve the political goals we want through dialogue and political action," Bashar al Assad said.
He also spoke about one of his country's allies, Russia's president Vladimir Putin, arguing that, in the context of the crisis in Ukraine, he was transformed, from a friend of the West, into his enemy.
Bashar al Assad compares the situation in Syria with that in Russia, accusing the West of falsifying reality in both cases.
Notice what happened in the Western press after the hit in Ukraine.
What's wrong?
President Putin was transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy and was characterized as a tar.
It is portrayed as a dictator who suppresses the opposition from Russia and who has come to power through non-democratic means, despite being elected in democratic elections, and the West itself acknowledged that the elections were democratic.
Now, I'm no longer democratic.
"This is Western propaganda," said Damascus leader.
Not least, it included Russia on the list of friendly countries - and regional partners - with which Syria is prepared to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, alongside Iran and Iraq, "because it faces the same type of terrorism".
Instead, Bashar al Assad criticised Turkey, another neighbouring country, as well as President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who said that "I can't even make a move without first coordinating with the United States and other Western countries".
In addition, Syria's president accuses the "International Coalition", led by the United States, who fights against terrorism: "In fact, when this Coalition began to operate, the Islamic State began to expand."
In other words, the coalition has been and has no impact on the ground.
At the same time, countries such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Western countries that provide coverage for terrorism, such as France, the United States or others, cannot fight against terrorism.
You can't be against terrorism at the same time.
"But if these countries decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in your pocket, it will overtake you - then we have no object to cooperate with all these countries, given that it is a real coalition and not a false coalition, that will fight against terrorism," Damascus's leader said.
Toamna?
Not a word.

Map of the Tari with the largest cheaps and how to stay Romania
The decline in the oil rating has led to large losses in the last year for workers in the extraction of the title, the shareholders of energy companies and the countries that depend heavily on this resource.
There is also a positive effect: the gas has been very cheap.
A map compiled by Bloomberg shows that, in the period October 2014 - July 2015, in almost all 76 countries taken into account, the price of fuel has dropped.
The most important reduction in the price of the pump is seen in Venezuela.
In this country, the engine has saved 97%, so you can feed 24 SUVs with less than a dollar.
On the opposite pole is Saudi Arabia, where the price is kept fixed by the state.
The cost of the engine varies from country to country, depending on the refining conditions, the changes in taxation, but also the fluctuations in the exchange rate.
For a more accurate comparison, Bloomberg turned the average price from each state into US dollars.
The situation in Romania
The Bloomberg data show that in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a gas gallon (approx. 3.8 liters) was $5.49.
So, we were in 27th place in the range of the most expensive fuel.
But we don't have to worry about this position in the top.
The last quarter of 2014, the gas was also cheap in the Romans.
At that time, the average price of a gallon was $6.14, which means a 10.6% price reduction.
Still, the tides around me stay even better.
In Bulgaria, a gas gallon costs $4.92, and in Hungary, $5.20.
The Germans put the fate of immigrants in the middle of the night: What Merkel promised
German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised Tuesday night that the federal government will provide additional support to the 16 countries of the Federation in receiving and distributing tens of thousands of migrants entering the country through southern Europe.
After a meeting of nearly 4 hours with the prime ministers of the 16 federal states, Merkel said that "the most important thing now is to create an orderly and transparent process to face the large number of refugees," the DPA agency notes.
She added that the federal government will create 40,000 places for initial arrivals, as well as distribution centres.
"They need such pivot points," she pointed out.
The whole country must provide a massive boost to face the crisis, Merkel added.
The country premieres requested more assistance than the 6 billion euros agreed by the ruling coalition at the federal level over a week.
Turkey's Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow from the Stanga Party asked for an "at least double, and for commitments, to be accelerated", in comments to a local newspaper.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister of the Rhine-Palatinate country, Malu Dreyer, insisted that migrants be quickly integrated into German society.
"We need a national pact among all players, not only the federal government, states and municipalities, but also business, trade unions and civil society," she said.
Dreyer also asked that the bureaucracy in handling refugees and migrants be accelerated.
She noted that Switzerland completed the trial in 48 hours and the Netherlands in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
The prime minister of Bavaria Horst Seehofer expressed similar feelings.
So far, Bavaria carries the worst burden, with the most migrants arriving after crossing the border with Austria.
Seehofer, a strong actor on the federal stage as head of the Christian-Social Union (CSU), a key component of the federal coalition government, entered into a public conflict with Merkel after the Chancellor announced a virtual policy of use opened at the beginning of the month, the DPA recalls.
Mircea Lucescu makes a scandal after the humiliating breakup with Real Madrid
Mircea Lucescu was a nervous car at the end of the game with Real Madrid, which Sahior Donnetk lost with 0-4.
The Roman coach turned out to be completely disturbed by arbitration, saying that Sahtior lost the intruder was favored.
Before the game, I said one thing, that I want to be respected.
Unfortunately, in the games with major teams in Europe, we are always in favour of arbitration.
There are two different ways.
The new one gives us a yellow cardboard right away, while the top teams don't.
Besides, the first penalty wasn't in any case!
The ball hit Darijo in the back, without touching his hand.
A similar level game should not be influenced by arbitration.
"Regret that the referee broke the game," Mircea Lucescu said at the press conference.
"Ma'am, what smells so ugly here?"
They were broken by the broken husband
A murder of a sadism came out of the commons and threatened the inhabitants of Targu Fromos and Roman.
Yesterday morning, in the early hours of the day, marketers in Targu Fromos were able to see terrifying scenes near the main market entry.
In addition to the three Tomberoons, the criminals took away what seemed to be a man's body.
It was crushed, but it was missing its head, internal organs and genitals.
Finally, he had to prove that it was the body of a former officer, who had been harassed by his wife, professor of geography.
"The newspaper of Iaşi" has been on the sidelines even with the taxi driver who helped the killer, without knowing it, on the road of the bags with the dead body.
His stories make your hair soft.
The one who alerted the police yesterday about the fact that a woman who had three bags that worked awfully, after cutting from the body was found on the market, was a taximer from Targu Fromos.
As in American films, the man himself helped transport bags full of human pieces, which smelled hard, but without knowing it, the killer was his client for a race.
The taximer told, exclusively for the "Iaşi Journal", the shocking scenes that he went through, helping without wanting a killer to hide evidence.
He carried with his hands the bags in which the body pieces of the husband's geography professor were broken.
She came to the Beautiful Square to hide the evidence of the murder, as far away from her home in Rome.
Maybe he's mine.
I didn't have how you know.
Nea Mihai, as is known by his friends who practice taximetry in Targu Beautiful, came to see over the night in the small town he lives in.
He saw American films throughout his life, but never thought he would ever catch himself standing on the basis of the discovery of a sadistic crime, and he would see with his eyes pieces of corpse.
It tells that, on the night of Monday to Tuesday, it usually expected the arrival of regular buses crossing the locality.
It is close to the intersection of the roads to Roman and Pašcani.
The taxi meter reports that the woman who killed noticed it in the mirror, next to the bags with body pieces supported by the indicator showing the appropriate locations.
She came at night with the Massaro race from 1.30.
The car left it at 10 metres from the passage of pedestrians to Pascani, exactly at the edge where the km is shown.
The bags were cut off by the banner with the indicator.
After the bus left, I put in the marcher ten meters up to it.
I opened the trunk and, after putting a bag, I asked, "Ma'am, what smells so ugly here?"
I saw she was an old woman, and I told her to help.
I thought it was taking meat to the market, to the decompose, maybe it's mine, I didn't know how to know.
I thought maybe she wanted to fool someone with that ugly, smelly meat.
She was trying to pick up a bag alone, and I refused to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the bag, where it was tied.
"He specified me to go to the big door of the market, when I took it from the bus," he began telling her Mihai.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He completed that the woman said absolutely nothing, and, therefore, he was no longer curious to ask her anything.
Until the destination, I didn't say anything, because I was nervous that he put my shoe in the car.
And when he put his bags down from the car, I noticed that smelled and hated.
She put the bags down from the trunk.
When I got back in the car, I put two meters in the back to get back, and I realized I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
I left the trunk open and moved the car back and forth, to disappear the smell.
I couldn't see if someone had been helped to get the bags down, because I had lights in the back and I didn't see them well in the mirror.
"There were two bags of plastic and one of rafie," the man finished.
Seeing the strange behavior of the woman, he says he's starting to notice his curiosity.
In my mind, I realized something was wrong.
After she put her bags down, I went to the hospital, to the Mayor, and when I got back, I especially forgot to see what the woman was doing with the luggage.
She passed through the luggage after the guard, where are also the Tombs inside the market.
Then I left again.
It was a little nervous, as they arrived a microbus from Italy and a bus.
I've seen how the woman went to their drivers to get into them, disappear, but probably the drivers didn't want to take her, because they have international races, and I don't take passengers on occasions.
The woman was very excited, she walked over and over again.
At a given time, the woman entered Peco and, curiously, I asked an employee outside what she did inside.
The employee replied that he went and washed his hands.
Then I asked him where the police patrol was, because I had seen her before for a while.
I searched them and found them coming to the market.
I showed them the woman and told them it was something suspicious.
"Then I went to the other side, a race to Belcești," she completed Mihai.
He already told us that the woman got upset after she left the bag in the graveyard.
To me, the suspicion went away from the fact that the luggage was gone, and I was curious what he did with it.
When the cops went to her, they asked her what she was doing there and showed her to me, telling her that I paid attention to her having a suspect luggage.
Then the woman went to the graveyards and showed them the luggage.
"I went back to the place where he hid the bags around 3:00 when I gave statements to the police and prosecutors from the place," the taxi meter concluded his report.
The prosecutors in Neamt, who investigate the case, say that the 64-year-old Professor Ana Zaharia was surprised by the cameras to see a gas station in Rome at 0.55, coming up with the three bags in the car.
She arrived at Targu Beautifuls at 1.30.
According to the investigators, she would have killed her husband, with whom she had been married for four years, with a knife, and then dragged him into the house.
The man was named Gheorghe Zaharia, and he was a reserve officer.
On Sunday night, the woman put the pieces of the body in two plastic bags, which she carried to the garage, and hid them.
The other night, he transported one, then decided which direction to go, and chose the Bucharest - Iaşi bus.
Yesterday, the prosecutors still didn't know where the woman hid her husband's internal organs, nor the genitals.
But the head was found wrapped in paper and bags, in a leak from the woman's apartment.
She was retired, like her husband.
Until last night, the prosecutors did not find out from a woman who was the reason why she killed her husband with so cold and sadistic blood.
Most likely, the professor will be mentally experienced and the body will be examined by legal doctors to officially determine the cause of death and any other relevant details.
The Prime Minister took over the national roads at the municipal level, after years of government taking over, in order to be able to raise money from the national budget in the 2004 electoral campaign.
The decision was taken yesterday by the Local Council (CL), and a decision of the Government must be implemented to enable it to be implemented.
Some sources say that the transfer of the right of administration from the National Roads Regional Directorate was a con dition in order for this to be in the constitution to give the opinion on the General Banistic Ur Plan (PUG).
The mayor took over a network of 11 km of roads.
In any case, a legislative amendment adopted in July 2015 obliges the municipality to take the national roads that cross the municipality.
No opinion can be delivered from the National Roads if the law is not respected, so it was necessary to approve this.
The national routes have passed into our administration since today.
"Of course, the decision of the government will also have to be issued as a result of this local Council decision," said interim Prime Minister Mihai Chirica.
National roads calling for the municipality are DN 24 and DN 28.
The 28th National Road hits the Iaşil on the artefacts: the Păcurari road, the Monteni road (to be mafort), the Moara de Foc, the Silver road, the Silver road, the Nicolae Iorga road, the Spring road, the Chişinăla road, the Tuutára road until the exit of the municipality to Tomești - Albíța.
The other national road, DN 24, includes Bucium, bd. Socola (up to Semafor), street Bucium (up to Baza 3), Chisinău Road, bd. Tudor Vladimirescu, bd. C.A. Rosetti and exit to Cârlig-Sculeni.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
Following the description of some files in the "file" of Mircea Eliade's youth political sympathies, which, however condensate, would be presented beyond the size of a daily article and should be broadcast in the series, deserves, believe, the bond between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the most powerful accused of using the great Roman detractors.
A less immoral description would be, I hope, useful in the real debate that the recent law, called "antilegionary", would have to be crushed in the Romanian intellectual environment.
Criticizing the various versions that spoke of Elijah's reign in the Legion through the Cube of "Axa" and Radu Gyr, Florin TURCANU brings into discussion, in the volume Mircea Eliade.
The prisoner of history (Bucuresti, 2003), another hypothesis, which is of the highest interest in understanding the resumption of epistolic contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after Ceausescu played "the balcony scene" that August.
Based on documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure, during the security investigation, in 1941, documents kept today in the SRI archive (FD, File 573, f.15) as well as on a tracking note from 1938, Florin Türcanu claims that "Eliades will not enter their group, but thus said "legionary family" called Luminića, a group of "cuburi" intellectuals, especially writers, led by the poet Radu Gyr".
As there is no verifiable data on the Luminist cub, those in exile considering the existence of this questionable "legionary family", which must be discussed, until the context in which this information was recorded in the file.
Leaving to a surprising part of the SRI's kindness to make these secret files available to Mr. Turcanu, it is more than evident that at that time the aim of the Security pursuit was "commandant" Radu Gyr, Elijah's mention being made, in accordance with the note of 21 March 1938, in the context of which Armand Calinescu, the Minister of the Interior received free to take all the necessary measures so that King Carol could impose his Royal dictatorship, suspending parliamentary life and eliminating the main political force of legionnaires who began to enjoy an unexpected popularity (Party of the Third Country in the 1937 elections).
The arrest of Eliade was carried out as a result of this note, quoted by Turcanu: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, framed in the Legionary Movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets under the leadership of Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr".
As far as I am concerned, I see this note as a subtle bureaucratic coverage for the repression of 1938 and it is likely that such superficial notes would have been made at the re-eployment for the vast majority of legionnaires or supporters in the public space that had to be arrested, but which had to be linked by an important legionnaire leader.
Radu Gyr's olograph statement mentioned above, given in arrest in February 1941, after the fall of the Legionary rebellion, only confirms it retrospectively on the first, the banal method of bureaucratic coverage in any police regime, author.
It would be interesting if TURCANU had provided more details about the content of the mentioned dossier 573.
Was it Elijah's file or Radu Gyr's file?
Because it has to be a file built on the basis of the security documents, but then processed by Security to be used either against the other.
There is a mistake here, as in the use of the term "member" of the Movement, which only someone who knows the achievement of the internal structures of this radical organization based on a religious foundation knows that it is a pre-emptive stage, by proof, in which the person concerned behaves as an active sympathizer, found in the three-year trial period before becoming a "comrade" with acts in order.
Also, all these forms of secondary organisation such as clubs or intellectual dinners, settlements, discussion groups with citizens, youth organisations or students were grave around a cube, they were his "family", they were not the cub of their own words, as a form of political organization and action.
This kind of nuances completely escapes the uninvited reader by making Elijah's "member" status (which may be plausible) understood and used by letter to designate political regulation in the cube.
Of course, the invocation of subtleties to interpretation of this kind cannot conceal the public activity of the Guard and no clear sympathy for the Captain who encouraged Elijah in the period 1935-1940, whether or not in the site of Nae Ionescu.
The public support of a case in which you believe does not necessarily mean, however, and the self-regulatory policy that is so much more generally expressed by the intellectuals of this case preserves a type of superiority in the face of activists as such and does not go into politics than when they are directly given high privileges.
As far as I could have formed an opinion about Elijah's thinking at that time, in which he was "the leader of the generation", I find it hard to believe that he would have accepted the hierarchical rigours from a legendary cube.
And Radu Gyr didn't have Nae Ionescu's intellectual ascendent, though!
To no longer mean, but in the past, that, in any legional "file", what it receives is anti-Semitic public activity as well as violence, both worthy to be stigmatized, but not in the case of Elijah, until new evidence.
With regard to the correspondence Eliade-Gyr between 1968 and 1969, Mircea Handoca, an enthusiastic advocate of Eliade, tries to sanction Florin Čurcanu's claims (based on some archive documents, even though it would have been more serious) with a discussionable argument.
Mircea Handoka notes, in the volume of Our gloss on Mircea Eliade (Bucuresti, 2006), that "there is no line of correspondence between Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr contains no allusion to this setting".
He didn't even have the way in 1968, when he came out of some kind of communist wave, Radu Gyr couldn't have risked any allusion in a letter that was obviously intercepted by censorship.
What I think wanted to highlight is the fact that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was a respectable, admirer and affection without any doubt about Elijah's ascension.
There is really no suggestion that Radu Gyr would ever have been Elijah's boss.
Intelligently, the poet obliged to write at the Glass of Patriots, unveils out of place the state of standing by signaling to Eliade (who knew very exactly what the mission had that publication that was constantly dealing with the downfall of the right exile), in signing, after "your old friend", what to expect, and is visiblely easy and happy when it responds to him in an emotional and emotional way after almost three decades of separation since "the viclean time" has distracted him.
There is no doubt that, beyond the "mission" with which he was charged (to convince Eliade that now, in the new Romania, he could return at least quietly to see his mother and friends) and that, possibly, he also fulfills it through short suggestions, separated from paragraphs, to suggest their character as a foreign body, Radu Gyr shows his interest only in literature.
Nor does it speak of esoteric allusions, of refined political complicities suggested or of any statement of the years of youth in a register other than cultural.
It is hard to believe that Radu Gyr would have been superior to Eliade's legional line, but until this version is consolidated with less circumstantial evidence than that provided by Florin TURCANU, we have in this corresponding memory stores that testify to a mutual appreciation of some characters who have marked different but stable, our culture and who, beyond the trials of life, find the tone of civilization and inter-ethnic education.
Important human and cultural documents and, why not?, pillars for the strength of friendship and mutual respect beyond the "under the time" destiny of the authors.
At the beginning of the 1970s, Eliade finally gave up his refugee status by getting American citizenship and, under the pretext offered by the country's health problems and catastrophic floods, announced the authorities of the RSR through the embassy (with a sporadic correspondence used to obtain passport for his sister), that he could not take the invitation to return to the country.
The sequence was predictable: it's back on the index, it's mounted in Israel's "Toladot business", the books sent to family and friends (Fragments of a newspaper, Galligard, 1973) are stopped by censorship, it never comes back to its mother.
Among the country's friends only with Noica has a sporadic correspondence, although surprisingly, as a Chicago personal archive testifies, many individuals or Romanian institutions are more able to send messages to them.
It's clear why Radu Gyr didn't get permission to write it after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Ceausescu regime tried the second operation of Elijah's conviction (by official invitations, Noica's sermons, translations, etc.) Radu Gyr already passed into eternity.
New coach, foreign player
Due to the shortage of autohtone volleyballists, Penicilina Iaşi tested in sports tournaments in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
Exits take part in training tournaments under coach Dan Gavril
Back in the first half of the year of Division A1 of female volleyballs, Penicilina Iaşi kept his place on the first stage due to the retreat and then the disassembly of the Miroslava Science formation, promulgated on the first stage following a bar tower even in the issuing community.
The news has taken little of the unprepared lead of the exit group, which has woken up without the main coach (after the departure of Rareş Puni, reached second to Bacau Science) and many missing players, some retarded like Cristina Lungu and liberal Diana Studeanu, or gone, like Ana-Maria Berdilla (at the Blue Baj Volleyball champion) and sisters Maria and Iuliana Fica.
Fires, until the start of the scheduled championship on October 10th, existed and there is still time to complete the batch.
Initially, a new coach was found in Dan Gavril's person, from the male team LPS Piatra Neamţ and who has worked little in Penicilina for the past few years, hoping to sign a contract with the group led by the Left Vasile.
Two players were then brought from Miroslava Science, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconic, being tried and several foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland, closer to transferring as the holiday player Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and Montenegrin Jelene Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of the month, the Peniciline lot led by Dan Gavril made a canton at the Humor Gura, after which he participated in a tour conducted at Lugoj and equipped with the Banata Cup, where the exits achieved a victory (3-0 with Cluj University), but also suffered two failures, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMU Craiova.
Next week, between 23-25 September, Penicilina will take part in another tournament in Craiova.
For the new championship, we're trying to build a valuable team.
We have a skilled and experienced coach, but the player fund in Romania is quite small and that's why we're going to call foreign volleyballists, especially after the decision has been made that teams can use an unlimited number of players outside the country.
This decision will affect the young generation of athletes from clubs in Romania.
"We hope to reach the end of the competition year at 5-6 places, even if it will be very difficult," said Vasile Left, president of ACS Penicilina Iași.
Emotional meeting.
Gems gathered after almost 70 years
Gemen George Skrzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, aged 69, were born at the end of World War II in Germany, after their Polish mother had just been released from a labor camp.
Because she was too sick to care for him, the twins were sent to Poland for adoption, the two brothers being so separated not only from the one who gave them life, but also from the other.
Ten years George and Lucian didn't know each other about the other's existence.
At the age of 17, George discovered documents showing that he was adopted and that he had a brother.
In the 1960s, he asked Red Cross to help him find his brother, but they didn't find any clues to lead him to Lucian.
In 2015, thanks to the program, "Restoring Family Links" of the Red Cross, the twins met again, and the moment was one more than exciting.
The BBC reporters were surprised by this episode.
Ten children from Iaşi brought home from Stuttgart four medals to sports dance
Two gold medals, a silver medal and a bronze medal were won by children who went to the German Open Championship in Stuttgart, an international sports dance competition organised by the German Federation of Sports Dance and the World Federation of Sports Dance.
Five pairs of Iaş participated in the Dance Energy Club and danced along with 9,000 athletes from 20 countries.
The 10 children who left participated in five different categories (youths 1, youths, June 2, youth and amateurs).
Those who returned home with the medals were the pairs: Rázvan Andrei Zaharia and Ana Maria Târzianu (two gold medals and one silver), Vlad Constantin Donosa and Otilia Ştefana Gologan (the bronze medal).
And three other pairs managed to occupy the front seats: Bogdan Stelian Sunday and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad Ene and Antonia Iosub Cujb, and not least the couple Andrei Emilia and Raluca Elena Ionică.
As a coach I greatly wanted to confirm the results achieved in March this year, this confirmation is needed for both us and athletes, as regards their future developments.
The fact that we have managed to make Romania hear twice this year at the German Open and return home with four medals makes us very happy and gives us hope and confidence that we can raise both the club and its athletes to the highest level.
"All of this would only be feasible with a few important elements: involvement, respect, trust and a lot of work," said Andreea Ramona Manolache, a coach for children from the Dance Energy Club.
Romania has been represented this year by 34 clubs in the country, this getting a total of 9 medals, thus qualifying our country as 4th of the 20 participating countries.
To mention that out of the new medals, four came to Iasi.
6 methods to escape stress in a minute
Too few of us allow us to run a weekend up the mountain to escape stress.
Some of us have our time, some of us have our finances, and some of us have both obstacles.
There are solutions to anyone who wants to escape some stress.
They do not involve any high costs or special time allocated, according to lyla.ro.
Day-to-day grids are inevitable, but it depends on us how we do them and what attitude we take them.
Instead of sitting inside and feeling an implosion takes place in your mind, you better try the next relaxation tactics that won't steal you more than a minute.
Deep breath
Respiratory exercises are not intended only for soloists or yoga practitioners.
They work for any person in part, and the regulation of breathing in a tense moment helps to release endorphins in the body, a process leading to a state of relaxation, reports Livestrong.
Be a Child
We know that we've exceeded the age of copying and we don't let ourselves get sidetracked when we have the boss.
But that doesn't mean we can't go in a corner of the office office or anywhere we know we're alone (even behind the building) and don't type as much as we're looking at.
You can escape the nerves and the negative energy accumulated over a day with some healthy birds.
Imagine a beautiful place
We know that the recommendation is worthy of a replica during a psychotherapy session, but it doesn't detract from psychology often.
The imagination of a beautiful place, which inspires us to calm down and capture daily braking, can lead to attenuation of the state of nerves.
It is, in fact, self-suggestion, a process that can even change lives, both good and bad.
Everything depends on what we're suggesting.
It's best to think of an idyllic place that warms our soul.
Listen to music
Put your castles in your ears and listen to the music of relaxation.
Attention, it's not about the favorite music, because if it's about heavy metal, you might have a hard time relaxing.
Listen even to the songs of relaxation, which are lines and do not contain verses, to restore the balance at the moment when your fit is lit.
Decoy the orange
Does it sound strange the advice to wear a nerve orange?
Well, it's not!
Caci is not a fruit in itself, because it does not contain miraculous substances or Xanax to disconnect us completely (occurringly, too total).
It's about aroma therapy!
The smell of orange coji during decoying stimulates the brain to produce endorphins, a hormone of good condition.
Mangae and animals
Those who have animals nearby, whether it's about the one at home or it's about the one who got up next to the job, take a few seconds to eat it.
According to the U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases, animal eating can decrease blood pressure.
watch and rock with violin and guitar
Two musicians in love with instruments like rivals, but collaborators in this acoustic project, sing Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, but also famous parts of the Romanic folklore combining life with guitar.
The acoustic project belongs to the musicians Cristian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe and is titled WHEN violin Meets Guitar, writes hotnews.ro.
Florentin: "We found ourselves, and since that time it has made us very pleased to sing together, having a practically unlimited repertoire."
We thought that was the moment when a soul met with a guitar.
Cristi: "From the first meeting we realized that what we were singing is very good and that, from the point of view of the human component, things are working."
Each of us has learned from the other repertoire and, what is very important, is that the sounds of the two instruments match.
Florentin: "I know there's a mess between people of classical music and the rest."
I think a lot of people can listen to classical music.
And in the second round we still stole a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rockers and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the bridge between genres, we want to offer a kind of music that can do to those who only listen to classical music to listen and rock, and those who only listen to rock to like classical music.
And we were surprised to be told at the end of a concert that they never imagined they'd listen to something like that and they'd like it.
Cristi: "When we find young people - and we find more and more - who know who Pink Floyd was, it seems amazing to us."
The students in Iaş stayed more in traffic than at school on the first day of the holiday
Hundreds of exits were "captive" yesterday in the infernal traffic in several areas.
The Prime Minister announced that today the bullevard Mangeron (splai Bahlui mal left), between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roş, is closing.
The Chiefs of the Prime Minister failed to meet their commitments to carry out work to smooth traffic at the start of the school year.
One of the assurances given by the municipality, at least twice in the last few weeks, has been seen in the re-establishment of the rotation in the International Cup area.
Although only a few provisional elements had to be installed, and the last deadline for the work was the end of last week, yesterday the rotation was not carried out.
Driver nerves have been reached to the maximum on Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, given that another Prime Minister's promise has been breached: the shifting of the customs activity from Nicolae Iorga to Tehnopolis "the late end of August", in the context of which this transfer has been discussed since 2012.
Currently, interim prime minister Mihai Chirica says the problem of the International Race is more complicated.
The rotation will be made at the right time, we need to take account of the traffic of the trams in the area, we need an opinion and from the National Roads.
"It's not like in Zimbru, where it's time for the tramway to stay in rotation, but we'll sort it out in a way," Chirica said.
One of the solutions, according to that, would be to stop the tramp with a semafort before turning.
The problems in circulation were also in the intersection of Podu Roş.
The range of cars on the street, the Saint Lazarus, extended to the SRI headquarters.
"I've waited a good minute to go out to Podu Roș," said one output.
By Podu Roș in September it was necessary to circle trams to the CUG if the project of rehabilitation "Development and rehabilitation of the South functional artery" was completed during the initial execution period (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complement the original one.
"I drew European funds for new works, such as overeating, on the original version of the Nicola Passion was narrow," Chirica commented.
The most recent deadline for the re-introduction of tramway traffic is October.
During the day, the exits reported problems in traffic mainly in areas such as Păcurari, Centre (Târgu Cucu, Independence, Armenian Street) or the intersection of Database 3.
Admission could return as chief to the CJ.
In the course of tomorrow you'll know for sure.
The judges of the Court will decide tomorrow whether the suspended President of the Jewish Council will maintain judicial control and prohibitions.
The judges of the Iaşi Tribunal have issued a new term in the file "Album", in which the President of the Iaşi Jewish Council is also indicted.
At the end of yesterday's sitting, the magistrates decided to vote in the course of the morning on the judicial review currently imposed against the Admonition.
It subsequently wishes to reside or revoke this measure, which keeps it away from the CJ's head office for several months.
In the case of a favourable solution, and if it is maintained by the Supreme Court, Christian Adominitity will be able to resume the CJ's presidency.
Admission was sent to the Court of Justice by the Antico breaking National Directorate (DNA), being accused of favouring the manufacturer and false intellectuals after, for the course, he would have tried to mask an audit control which revealed a number of irregularities regarding the reception of a public contract signed between CJ and Laser Co.
Admissions would have tried to hide the fact that the institution that led them would not have received more material to promote the Iaşi case, although Iaşi wrote these materials as being received by the CJ.
In addition, he was also referencing justice and three CJ directors, as well as the company administrator of Laser Co.
There are still 3,500 results expected in the vote until 25 September
The prime minister is prepared to distribute other questions if the 12,000 will be exhausted.
The exits have only ten days left to express their opinion on replanting the Great Stephen.
According to municipal officials, up to now some 8,500 of the 12,000 questionnaires were completed at the city centre and in three additional points (Copou Park, Alexandru del Bun and Primarye Planada).
A record number of exits was presented on Sunday in front of the Prime Minister.
According to the representatives of the civilian group "Iaşul loves the teas", 530 outers voted in 140 minutes, respectively nearly four votes expressed in each minute.
Instead, over the course of the month, about 440 came out in the same place.
The group's volunteers say that many outlaws call for the re-signal and the people to have inefficient public consultation.
Therefore, they called on internet users yesterday to print a group information sheet and to hide it in the block stairs.
Volunteers also showed that at the additional point in Copou Park the last forms were completed by Sunday exits.
We'll provide a form from the neighborhood centers, where it's not too complete.
"Any additions will be made when all the 12,000 forms will be completed," the municipality spokesman Sebastian Burga said yesterday.
"Non-Secret" will end on September 25th, and if the majority vote of the outputs is in favour of replanting the trees then the Prime Minister will plant your silver in this fall.
The exits can express their opinion at the district centres of Dalia, Frumoasa, Tatarasi, Nicolina and Păcurari, as well as in the additional points mentioned above.
The Chiefs of the Primate decided to cut off Stephen the Great in early 2013, an action that attracted an amendment of 60,000 lei to the municipality.
The decision was taken unilaterally, without consultation of the population, and led to the spontaneous appearance of the civilian group "Iaşul loves tevi", an online community of about 13,500 people.
In the virtual environment, a petition initiated by the civilian group for their replanting was signed by more than 9,100 supporters until last night.
RECORD of students registered at USAMV Iaşi!
I'm 920 in year I
This year the university has 920 students in year I.
Representatives of the University of Agricultural Science and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ionescu de la Brad" stated that this year were the most admitted candidates ever, in the history of the higher education institution, since the establishment.
We are very grateful for the results of this year's admission.
We have the largest number of admitted candidates in the history of the university, nearly 920 students in the year I. I have never exceeded such a number.
"We also had senior candidates, we occupied the places from the budget to the license and master," said Prof.Ioan Tienu, a procurator responsible for teaching.
It further stated that the university registered a considerable number of tax students, occupying 20% of those places, a significantly higher figure than in other years.
Although the results of the study were also published on the Romanian-language lines, the English-language study programme from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine has continued to be accepted, which took 50 places, where the fee is EUR 5,000, and now the Minister's response is expected to confirm the files of students and study visas required.
At the autumn session, a total of 120 files were submitted to the 14 budgeted seats and 209 out of the competition under the "tax" scheme, to the licensing studies.
Most files were filed at the Faculty of Agriculture, in number 75, in Horticulture, were 23, and at Zootechnie, 22.
At the master they filed at the autumn session of 18 files, at the 150 tax places proposed by USAMV, seven of them at Agriculture, five at Horticulture and six at Zootechnie.
Drivers are afraid to enter the wheels of cars on the bridge Tudor Vladimirescu
The bridge across the Bahlui from Tudor Vladimirescu remained as curious as when the newspaper of Iaşi wrote about the problems they faced 10 days ago.
Our daily reporters then signaled that on the axis that limits the two motions of the asphalt left, defending deep pits, some even 20 centimeters, through which concrete plates representing the primary infrastructure of the bridge are seen.
The asphalt also began to be fixed on one side and on the other side, with signs that the depths would be accentuated.
At that time, interim Prime Minister Mihai Chirica specified that the bridge had no structural problems, being recently made a technical expertise to start a project to rehabilitate the bridge and tram, worth EUR 5 million.
Prime Minister Chirica specified that the area affected by fissures and pits will be signalled, with rapid work on asphalt recovery to be carried out.
The only measures taken so far, however, have been the assembly of poppies and a signal band, without even making a single flood.
In this period, we have focused more on opening school and the necessary work for this purpose.
"It's a point-by-point expertise for the bridge we're waiting for in about a week with the necessary details of the intervention, I appreciate that within two weeks we could move on to remedy the situation," the interim prime minister said.
At the beginning of school year
Yesterday, my eldest son, Stefan, started school.
The preparatory class, as he tries to improve the situation.
I don't know if I'm happy or let go of melancholy; turn, passive, to the second.
First of all, because I've had the feeling that it's only been three weeks, not three years since I took him to the gym for the first time, with emotion.
Although it is not easy, no normal parent is happy to raise their children.
Secondly, because I remember perfectly the same day of my childhood; then a story that, at the end of the day, didn't even come to an end.
I wasn't even what's usually called a conscious student.
Instead, I'd say.
But I always liked school.
So much, I chose to continue to attend, even though I was a teacher.
When I decided that this is what I want to do all my life, I knew it wasn't an easy job.
And no one with a table.
That's because, like each one of us, I've given myself over to all the so-called teachers: better or worse, more sympathetic or unbearable, smarter or rightless.
It happens, unfortunately, that there are also people with other calls in this puzzle.
I think they're toxic, because it leaves the enthusiasm and even the mind of a young person willing to form.
I had the luck to give, as long as I was a student or student, over a few, a little, an exception.
These meetings can be crucial if they are to be held at the right time.
Who thinks that the role of the department is the banal transmission of information is atrocious.
This can be done by anyone; to inform the student very well by one alone, that we are only living in the time of transparency.
A good teacher, however, molds the minds of the students.
He's training them, he's flattering their thinking.
Staying in the booth is not a privilege, as I think enough, but a great responsibility.
Young people are very mofturos, they are demanding, unforgiving, and always willing to seek out those in front of them.
That's how they dictate age, temperament.
As a teenager, we all thought that we knew everything, that we had some uncertainty about anything.
When we mature, we get to understand that we only have doubts.
Therefore, the role of a teacher is to take the adolescent out of the category of self-sufficiency and make him think.
I mean, he starts to doubt himself, ask himself questions.
Discover the answers on their own, whether they or not.
Get involved in everything he does.
To direct him discreetly to the profitable models.
It's very difficult, especially that most of the time the student thinks the teacher is his enemy.
One who is just waiting to catch him on the wrong foot to sanction him.
But this corrects him, the foolish, the rebellious, and the debtor to live with full age, to look at the man from the chair with suspicion.
That he just doesn't have a way to naturally accept his attempt to order him.
Adolescents are not allowed to be released, they do not accept restrictions.
Or, if I give the impression that I do, they're getting revenge.
And, unfortunately, when there's a stiff person at the camp, who insists on the hardness and does not communicate, the students take revenge on the object taught.
There are thousands of such teenagers who miss meetings with the great writers because of the lack of tact of the Romanian teacher.
There are thousands of such students who have the impression that history is a data merge, that mathematics is all that can be more tiring for their improper mind.
I always ask students: if you give a teacher that you don't swallow, who doesn't know how to communicate as from man to man with you, don't let him take you away from the literature to which you should be directed.
How did it happen that I became myself?
I had a very good teacher in the VI-VIII classes.
He has opened my mind to some texts that have spoken to the pub since then on his mind.
I've met in high school a university professor who opened my door to his library.
I looked at him as a man from another world: had walls of the house covered with rotten books.
I was lost in his library and I was dreaming to have the same.
Now I might have it, but if I hadn't gotten rid of it, I might have decided to become a football player.
Or an engineer or an attorney or who knows what else.
I don't think such meetings are happening.
I don't believe in gambling.
It is essential that you give over the man who takes your hand and patiently directs you to his own vocation.
And this is, most of the time, the professor.
Now, my experience helps me to discuss just what it means to teach literature.
Only the literature can't be handed over.
There's no literature teacher, just like there's a math teacher.
How do you fix the infallible concept?
You can, by the way, approach him, without claiming to convey petrified truths.
The one in the chair can guide the reading, that's all.
But especially can you have some miraculous meetings, between a reader and some books.
There are meetings that can change the life of the bank.
These are meetings that can open their minds, that can raise their voices, talk to someone, their eyes open.
Therefore, the professor of literature must first of all be able to make his students understand (if they feel) that there is no divorce between literature and life.
On the contrary!
A great coseur, Al. Paleologist, says one thing that seems paradoxical: "How much literature, so much life, not vice versa!" and was right.
That's why, a good record prepares you for life, doesn't make you a specialist in any open field.
Luckily, we always have to learn a few things.
And we, the teachers; or especially the teachers.
Most of the time, it repeats only a great truth from the inertion: not only the disciples have to learn from their masters, but also vice versa.
Ideally, the teacher should be a teacher, and the student should be a student.
Which, like any valuable young man, leaves his master when he discovers his own way.
A little bit of it, it's right.
But the master was the one who lit the candle.
I don't think there's any greater happiness for a professor of pure blood than to endure as many divisions as possible.

If an investigation is extended to FIFA
The US Justice and Switzerland will undergo new arrests
The US and Swiss authorities have announced that they will start prosecutions in the case of new persons and organisations, in the investigation of FIFA corruption, inform the international press.
US Justice Minister Loretta Lynch announced, on Monday, in a press conference organised in Zurich, that the area of investigations into global football corruption was widened.
"On the basis of our cooperation and on the basis of new evidence, we will commit additional prosecutions to new individuals and new organisations," Lynch said.
In May, several senior FIFA officials were arrested in Switzerland in this case of corruption.
Many of them have already been extracted to the United States.
"We have hopes that other people who have been prosecuted will also arrive in the US," Lynch added.
The Swiss Attorney-General Michael Lauber, also present at the press conference, said that his institution had sequestered several goods, including dwellings and land in the Alps, as well as financial assets, in the course of the investigation carried out in collaboration with the US.
"I didn't even get to the end of the first replay," Lauber said.
So far, a very large amount of information, 11 terrabytes has been confiscated.
At the same time, 121 bank accounts are being investigated.
In the attention of the investigators, there was also a contract to award media rights to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and 2014 - Brazil.
FIFA faces a major corruption scandal, after the US justice has accused 14 people, including two FIFA Vice-Presidents and seven forum officials.
Detained persons are researched for bribery and other benefits from the early 1990s and up to now, totaling over 150 million dollars.
Following this scandal, Swiss Joseph Blatter announced, at the beginning of July, that he resigned from the FIFA presidency, after being realized for the fifth time.
Fighting like a movie at the theater
In the Gala Supekombat de Milano, the exit of Cătălin Moroşanu will fight with the "beast" James Wilson
A series of Romanian fighters, including the "scorpion" of Cătălin Moroşanu, will take part on 2 October in the Gala Superkbat at the Linear 4 Ciak Theatre in Milan, the last before the end of November, is shown in a communication released by MEDIAFAX.
We were impressed by the atmosphere last year, and as I promised, we'll come back this fall with a new five-star gala.
If we're still choosing a place to do this, a theater, then we promise to fight like in movies.
We're going to have eight Romanian fighters in the event program.
In addition to the games with the already consecrated stars, we will have another gala in the opening, which will include the best fighters of the new generation, including the Romans Cristi Sceptcu, Cristian Stancu and Amansio Paraschiv.
"It will soon be announced and the full programme," said the promoter Eduard Irimia.
Cătălin Moroşanu will fight in the Supercombat World Grand Prix Final Elimination Gale with American James Wilson, known after participating in the last pyramid in 2012 in the heavy category organized in Japan and the numerous awards from bodybuilding conquests.
I can't wait to fight in Italy.
I've seen Wilson, it's really a beast, but I'm demolishing him!
I'm still angry that last year I couldn't fight in the end, so now I'm going to avenge him.
"From beast to cat," said Moroşanu.
In 2015, Andrei and Bogdan Stoica brothers will have the last confrontations in Italy before fighting for world titles on 7 November in the final sea.
Last year, both of them were imposed by KO in Italy, and now I promise they'll repeat the scenario.
I'm glad I'm back in Italy, the atmosphere last year was incredible.
"I'm looking forward to meeting with fans from there and promising them a new show," said Andrei Stoica, a world champion.
Raul Catinaş will also fight with an opponent to be established in Milan.
A little girl invited the Queen of England to her day, but she also argued in writing
A girl from Britain sent Queen Elizabeth an invitation to attend her birthday.
At the same time, the six-year-old girl congratulated the Queen for the longest rule, but did not forget to mention that she was not allowed access to the Buckingham Palace when she went to visit him along with his family.
Writing did not go unnoticed, but the girl received a reply from the representatives of the Royal House.
The Queen thanked him for his invitation, but she also apologized for not being able to be present on 27 September, so she hated him for having fun with family and friends.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together to a talk show shortly before the poet Adrian Păunescu died.
Both writers died of heart.
The fate of Adrian Păunescu and of Vadim Tudor is similar.
They were both writers and politicians, and they both came to an early age, with a heart.
Adrian Păunescu, 67 years old, Vadim Tudor, 65 years old.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together in 2010, shortly before Adrian Păunescu died, on a TV show.
Plin de vervare, Vadim Tudor has ironied Gheorghe Flutur and criticised Elena Udrea, Minister of Tourism since then, for the situation of Romanian tourism.
At some point, Vadim Tudor said, with a smile on his jokes, to Adrian Păunescu: "I'm envious of your posthumous glory, Adrian."
He smiled, and then he said, "It's not too laudable what you've said to me right now."
Adrian Păunescu died on November 5, 2010, at the age of 67.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor died today, September 14, 2015, at the age of 65.
Two INCONSENT persons after an ACCIDENT in Dumbrava
An accident took place Monday night around 7:00 a.m. in Dumbrava District of Iaşi County.
A biker was taken up by a Volkswagen bus.
The cyclist was not observed by the driver.
Luckily, they're both stable.
As a result of the impact, the parking space and the mirror of the cars were broken.
Two injured persons are unconscious at the time of transmission of this news.
A SMURD team is on its way to provide medical assistance to victims and to transport them to the hospital.
The cops are at the scene.
A Syrian artist turned Super Mario into a refugee.
A Syrian artist created a version with refugees of the popular game "Super Mario", which evokes the plight of his compatriots on their way to Europe.
Instead of presenting the adventures of the Italian installer Mario in the Kingdom of the Cyprians, the modified video game has its centre on the Mario Refugee.
The person is trying to cross the border police and human trafficking, on his way to a European Union refugee centre.
The artist established in Istanbul uses the pseudonym Samir al-Mufti for security reasons and said he made the video game with the Mario refugee after his friends took an adventure on a dangerous journey to Europe to escape the horrors of war.
At the Craiova Prison Centre, the youngest student is 15 and is in class I
Justice Minister Robert Cazanciuc said, at the opening of the school year at Craiova Prison Centre, that the youngest student is 15 and is in class I, and the oldest is 25 and is in class XI, showing that they could have another life if they went to school.
I have chosen to participate in the opening of school year in a centre belonging to the National Prison Administration to try to attract attention, and in this way, on a few less known realities.
The youngest student, at the age of 15, is enrolled in class I, and the oldest is 25 and is enrolled in class XI.
"There are complicated subjects that society is concerned about discussing at this moment, we are all overwhelmed by our own concerns and problems, but we do not have to pass on the lesson that these over 100 young people from the Craiova Prison Centre offer," Minister Robert Cazanciuc said on Monday at the opening of the school year festival.
The Minister of Justice drew attention to the fact that the lack of education, motivated in many cases by the lack of material opportunities, may lead to tragedies, specifying that young people in this centre would have another chance in life if they could follow any child's fair school course, if they had the opportunity to learn not only to write, read, but also to receive a set of moral values, to know what respect for the law and what consequences it might have had.
"The role of the prison system is not that of permanent isolation of the people who have violated the law, of closing them behind high walls, but that of trying to bring them back and prepare them, for when they return to the middle of the community to have more chance of reintegration," Cazancic added.
The Minister stated that investment in schools, hospitals, roads, but also investment in the prison system should be made, because, in many cases, conditions of detention are limited to humanity and because, in the absence of money and staff, it will be difficult to talk about the reintegration of convicted persons.
We work very well with the Ministry of Education and because of this partnership, every year in the prison system, there are over 2000 graduates of school courses.
Obviously, we won't be able to change overnight what hasn't been done for 25 years, but it's important steps that we're taking.
"In all these ways we need the support of society, and this support can only come if we demonstrate that we are doing our duty, that through your work these young people have a chance and do not pose a danger to society," Cazancicuc said.
The Minister of Justice hated success for both students and educators, showing that success comes only through the joint effort of all.
"And because today is the celebration of the Highness of the Holy Cross, I would invite all students and teachers to visit the mausoleums from the Soviet Union, the Great and not only, to understand what it means to fight young people for ideals," said Robert Cazanciuc.
A Russian came to vote with the bear
Doctoral schools caught with two plagiarisms to be destroyed!
Request of prestigious university students in Iaşi and country
Over 200 researchers, university frameworks, personalities and students from the country signed a petition launched by the Romanian Academic Society calling for the Ministry of Education and Research to assess, sanction and even disassembly of the doctoral schools in Romania "which allows and promotes academic taxation".
Among the signatories to the petition launched on 10 September are also the teaching framework and teachers in Iaşi.
Among the signatory university students of the petition from the academic environment is, for example, Prof. Liviu Antonesei.
At the national level, the petition has names from former Ministers of Education, such as Mircea Miklea, to people of culture who are also academic frameworks, such as Andrei Pleșu, Aurora Liiceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.
"Although the Education Law provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this has not been achieved so far, thus determining the lack of specific sanctions for doctoral schools that flammablely violate the ethical standards of scientific research and do not produce relevant and internationally recognised performance," the requested request states.
That request specifically requires compliance with the National Education Act, evaluation of doctoral schools, suspension of the right to work for any doctoral school where more than two were found, until evaluation and remedying the situation.
The last requirement is the suspension of the right to operate for any doctoral school in which there is no minimum number of doctorate directors provided for by law to meet the criteria imposed by the National Scientific Research Council in 2011 for eligibility for IDEI type project grants.
Do you respect less a general without a doctorate, or a politician, or an information agent in the Middle East?
"Why don't there be other universities in Europe to give doctorate organised by secret services, and the top military who give the doctorate to autonomous academic institutions, where the quality is verified by the academic environment?" said Alina Mungui-Pipidi, president of the Romanian Academy Society, initiator of the petition, originating her from Iasi.
This can be completed by all volunteers on the Company's website, and the final signatures will be submitted by organization to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.
We're not looking for three people with money, but 10,000 who want to get involved.
The "Pentru Iași" party, founded by young IT managers of political unaffiliated, was launched elsewhere in the Copou Park.
The president of the "Pentru Iași" Initiative Group gave an interview to the "Iaşi Journal"
The island will have a dedicated party exclusively to the development of the city.
A group of unaffiliated political entrepreneurs and managers has so far launched at the end of last week's Party for Iasi organisation that will propose candidates for the 2016 local elections.
At present, the party core is formed by IT specialists, but formation initiators say that all people in the organization are welcome who want to be involved in modernising the city.
The launch took place on Saturday, in Copou Park, and at the event more than 200 supporters attended, almost all being young.
The special invitation to the action was Nicoşor Dan, president of the Bucharest Save Association.
He was a surprise of the 2012 local elections when, from an independent position, he managed to gather 10% of the Bucharest votes for the capital's primary function.
"The people I saw at "Pentru Iaşi" think they're very good at accessing the public administration of Iaş."
I believe in this initiative, I think it has a chance, I think it has a chance in a community smaller than that in Bucharest.
"I'll be with you all the time," Nisushor Dan said.
ZDI: Why didn't you leave Iasi to work in an IT company abroad?
Andrei Postolache: The reasons are rather sentimental and emotional.
I've been away on many short business trips, I've lived a year in Cluj.
I came back every time, because I felt here is my house.
ZDI: Why did you now decide to set up a political party?
Andrei Postolache:Now we've come to a certain maturity, we're a group of people that we've been getting to know each other for a while.
We met in professional contexts, we started discussing how we could get involved.
At first, we have involved ourselves more shyly, in smaller things, with projects at NGOs, various building or charity actions, and, in some cases, things have evolved natural and organic and now it has happened to be the moment we have reached the decision that we need to involve ourselves more than that.
ZDI: Name three concrete projects for the efficiency of local public administration activity!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of a minimal computerization of the primary activity so that the different departments, institutions and regions can cooperate as best as possible.
But more importantly, they can publish transparent data on the activities carried out in detail: budgets, reports, projects, etc. We are talking about information organization.
The second would be transparency because this leads to efficiency.
If you have a project in a certain neighborhood, public consultation of the affected people is important.
If we talk about efficiency, we don't have to forget the transport in common, we have the worst buses in the country.
You have to buy new means of transport.
ZDI: Today, the image of a city is extremely important.
How would you promote the Iaş?
Andrei Postolache:You're on a plane and you're looking for investors in this world.
There are conferences, industrial events where you can "sell" the city.
You have to want to do this and you know to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from business and we brought customers to Iaşi.
ZDI: What is the brand of the Iaş?
Andrei Postolache: My opinion is that we need to be a city of technology in one way or another.
We already have the IT industry and we need to expand it, go into medicine, enter the robotic area, into the 3D printing area, continue in this spirit and join such elements.
I think the brand should be in the science area, I refer here to the modern city brand.
Of course, the Iaş already has a historical brand that must not be changed, that is, cultural city.
I see the two elements in balance: culture and technology.
ZDI: How will you compensate for the lack of experience in public administration, as well as the lack of traditional party structures that still win elections in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: Administration is a form of management, which means organizing, planning, communicating, working with people and delivering projects.
We have experience in management.
We don't want traditional structures, we don't care.
We want to get people involved, we're gonna talk to everybody, we're not just staying on Facebook, we're not online.
We don't want to have "volunteers" brought by bus.
That means we rely on people who really want to get involved and help, and we think they're quite people like that.
ZDI: Should Iaş's prime minister be more concerned about promoting the image of the city at national and international level, or is it necessary that the area of concern be permanently built?
Andrei Postolache: One without another doesn't work.
First of all, you need to solve today's problems, emergency.
Or, if you don't make a known city, if you don't attract money in the city, at a given time you'll be without money and you won't be able to do, for example, streets.
You have to do both at the same time and you need competent people.
The mayor doesn't have to do everything.
We have to give up the model of the father-in-law, who comes and beats with his fist in the table and solves everything.
No, no, no.
We're a team.
The principal is the coordinator of an orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attract business people from the IT area who can support the party financially?
Andrei Postolache: We are looking for people who want to do something good, have an unspoiled reputation, be clearly integral and be honorable.
From this point of view, we don't have any other filters.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people, or, why not, 300,000, who want to get involved and do something for the city.
Interview by Alex ANDREI
Andrei Postolache has been working in the IT industry for almost 15 years.
In July 2015, the Introspecials company was established, after seven years, as director of the Endava International Group (2008 - 2015), where it coordinated a team of 300 people.
Another four years (2003 - 2007) spent in Synygy.
The company set up by another IT specialist provides management consulting services.
Rabla tractor program proved to be a failure
The Director-General of SC IRUM SA Reghin, Mircea Olitan, said that the programme to stimulate the renewal of the national park of tractors and agricultural cars, launched in 2011, named and Rabla for tractors, was a failure due to red tape.
With regard to the Rabla programme, there have been some attempts in recent years, but it has been proved to be a failure, because the documentation was very laborious and complicated for a farmer, and the approvals were too long and then the world gave up.
That program managed to sell it somewhere at 10 pieces.
"The need for tractors for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces," Mircea Oltean said.
According to this, IRUM Reghin is the only company that produces several hundred tractors each year, the largest in Romania, and that great competition is exercised by companies from abroad, who know the needs of the Romanian market.
It is a very great competition with those coming out, all world producers have looked at Romania, know these things I told you, and have special policies.
"At all auctions there is a large aggregate, all producers exhibit, come with all sorts of variants," said Mircea Oltean, who pointed out that IRUM Reghin produces around 500 agricultural tractors and forest tractors annually.
By the Rabla tractor programme, initiated in 2011, those holding old tractors or other self-propelled means, such as combinations, were able to sell and exchange a valuable 17,000 lei ticket.
The red flag has risen.
The internal scrotum of the labs seems more spectacular and significant political, as the new elected leader automatically becomes his launch peak in future elections.
Raise, therefore, the red-white flag/ Under his traps we will live and die.
That's what Jeremy Corbyn sang yesterday in the London Shrine House.
He's been testifying many facts and oaths/ Let's not change his color now.
Citizens who do not know the melodic line of this unofficial British and international left (The Red Flag) may be looking for it online and would not be excluded from a surprise.
With the heads discovered, let's all swear we'll wear it until we get lost.
The author of these ranks is not at all an admirer of the red flags (and not of those flying them), but respects the democratic political traditions built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn succeeds in joining the left of yesterday with that of tomorrow, this love story between him and the Labour Party base will be part of a happy-end.
I don't think it will happen that way, but it seems to me premature to talk about the great and inevitable electoral defeat, over five years, of an elected leader.
Now, however, we can refer to procedures: we have witnessed a democratic exercise of an impressive scale.
Not British labs invented the voting system directly for the party leader, on the left-hand side.
French socialists have been practicing a more complicated system, based on motions, which allows the expression of all members and supporters; in addition, they have organised a preliminary competition for the nomination of the candidate to the presidency in 2012.
However, the internal polling of the labs seems more spectacular and significant political, as the new elected leader automatically becomes his launch peak in future elections.
It is, of course, also a matter of political system, the personalization of power being more pronounced in the UK than the rest of the Channel.
In addition, participation in the vote was great in all three "circuits": self-employed members, union members and other organisations associated with the party and, finally, the group of supporters (who received the ballot card after a summary registration procedure).
This last group provides us with interesting information about the perceptions of left-hand segments of British society, especially those of young or middle-aged people, educated, interested in the political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to involve themselves more, in the future, precisely because of the signal offered by Corbyn's victory.
There are, as far as I know, sociological investigations that tell us too much about the attitudes of this "outside circle" labyrinth, so careful speculation is allowed.
I think we meet enough similar attitudes to those of the Podemos (Spain) and even SYRIZA (Greece), with the observation that they will cross the traditional left channels.
If we have to identify a term "antisist", it is primarily reflected by rejecting the centralist line, New Labour (for many, only a dissimulated form of multi-hulit thatcherism).
The second component would be the repudiation of the leaders considered guilty of the two successive electoral failures, one of the arguments being that they did not go to the left sufficiently, that they did not stop at Tony Blair's time.
The second reper - after me, and more suggestive - is offered by the recent referendum on Scotland's independence.
If we are abstracting the separatist message and focusing strictly on the aspirations of other political themes, we see that Scottish nationalists have captured the energies of public segments that are favourable to the social state and motivated by the aspirations of equity, appropriate disarmament and the enemies of military involvement over decision-making, but also sensitive to the new themes of left: ecology, gene, assistance for poor countries.
Scottish laborers thus lost an electorate to which, in principle, they should have had at least privileged access, but which they can now recover (see their enthusiasm for Corbyn's campaign).
Like energy exists all over the United Kingdom, but the old leadership couldn't attract them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his calling of outsiders, has more chance of success than Ed Miliband, the "aristocrate"labourist.
The comparison with Scotland tells us more, I think, than the left-wing anti-system in southern Europe.
The term "antistism" is too hard: "anti-establishment" seems more appropriate to me.
Until next week we'll find out more about Jeremy Corbyn's first steps as opposition leader.
We'll see if some red flag will respond in the House of Commons (it wouldn't be for the first time), after the new leader has occupied his seat, first of all the opposition banks.
Anyway, what Jeremy Corbyn now wants from his colleagues in Parliament is first of all unity - and in this regard he has reason to be concerned.
Manipulation trap with or without good science
While I wrote the article, I went through the network to check on the story of the former fighter and the "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" who became in the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marin to his "Jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "Jihadist" - could in itself make me from the beginning circumspect).
I didn't.
In the last week's article (Europe, between refugees and "refugees") I commented in parallel with two pictures - the one with the boy Aylan Kurdi found dead on the Mediterranean Sea and the one, in fact: the two seeing Syrian Laith Al-Saleh once as a fighter, twice as a refugee.
The story with Laith Al-Saleh was taken from the article "Syrian Fighters Come With the Valley of Refugees" (signed by Viorica Marin in the Truth of 3 September).
Monday evening, I posted a link to my article on my Facebook page.
Tuesday, entering Facebook, we found, among other things, a handful of hands from a friend (not only from FB) Marius Cristian: "Subscribe, but a clarification. Laith al Saleh is not a jihadist".
On the contrary, he is fighting against Al Assad for democracy and that one.
"So you could add the grossolan manipulation in the table"!
I have to admit, I felt naked.
The more I wrote the article, the more I went through the network to check the story of the former fighter and the "syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marin to his "Laith Al-Saleh" person (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could in itself make me from the beginning circumspect).
Because I had confidence in the truth, in his journalists.
Instead, I had no other comment on the pull of Marius Christian than this: "So I need to (have) faith in the Truth"
After that, I obviously took the big money and I owe it to readers with the correct presentation of the Syrian story Laith Al-Saleh.
The oldest we found in an Associated Press material (Syrian rebel leader seeks Europe - Syrian rebel leader search for Europe) signed by Nicholas Baphitis and Dalton Bennett from 17 August 2015 on the island of Kos in Greece, where they noticed, among the hundreds, thousands of refugees, on a man who tried to order in the chaos of the majority.
The man was the Syrian destroyer Laith Al Saleh of Aleppo who "was used to be in command", while he "led a unit of 700 rebels in the civil war in Syria".
We also find that at the age of 30, Al Saleh had "a house, a wife and a normal life before he started a struggle that cost more than 250,000 lives and put a third of the population of Syria on the road".
In an interview with Associated Press correspondents, Al Saleh says that "all people want to leave Syria."
My city is the most dangerous cities in the world.
About 70% of the city is destroyed.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (an extremist group of the Islamic State) wants me, the government wants me to fight everyone.
Beyond the fact that he was kicked out of a supermarket on the island, Kos would have offered him "a meeting and a more sinister - with a man who recognized an enemy Syrian": "Now two days, I have seen a lunetist from the government forces."
I haven't spoken to him, but I'm still very upset.
We find more material that Laith (meaning lion in Arabic) was really on his way to the Netherlands, where he had a cousin - he was a senior officer in the Syrian army and then he became a rebel and arrived in the West after he was seriously wounded - hoping to get asylum and can bring his family then - the wife and a three-year-old boy (nearly an old civilian war in Syria, which exploded in March 2011).
After this has been accomplished, Laith Al-Saleh would not have been excluded from a return to Syria to continue fighting for the Syrian Free Army (frozen by the West) - against the three forces: the army of President Bashar Assad (frozen by the Russians), the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
A madness - whoever wants freedom must fight not one enemy but three!
I've been working on a Serbian material since August 22, of which I didn't understand much, just that Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists who come along with migrants: TERORISTS ARE KRIJU MIGRANTIMA calls the title of a news from http://www.telegraf.rs/ves, in which they are accompanied by a photo with Al Saleh with beards holding a Syrian flag in his hand and that of the refugee in which he wears the shirt with "THANK YOU".
On September 7th, then, on the BBC website, Mike Wendling drew attention to the case of handling photos with the Syrian fighter: This viral photo fakely claims to show an IS figure posing as a refugee - This viral photo claims to be wrong that a fighter of the Islamic State poses in a refugee.
We find that the picture (in fact: photos - the one with Laith with beards and arms and the one with THANK YOU) was posted by a user on Facebook, who would have apologized to the user in the meantime.
Just before that, just on his wall, the picture with the two pictures would have been taken more than 70,000 times, gathering a few thousand comments.
That word, too late, the horse's gone!
In Romania, on September 9, Carla Dinu from Hotnews took the story with the manipulation of the BBC, but mistranslated the title: "A fake photo became the virus shows an ISIS fighter being a refugee."
Obviously, the photograph is not false, but the interpretation was a false, wrong, short: manipulation.
