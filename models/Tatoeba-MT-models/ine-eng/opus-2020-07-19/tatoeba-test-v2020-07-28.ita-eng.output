You refused to pay.
Tom called his dog Cookie.
Send her away.
Tom decided to buy a house.
They're too young to drive a car.
He's stronger than me.
I'm the last one to see them.
I watched her.
That man is a soldier.
I thought Tom was guilty.
I played that song so much I could do it while I slept.
I want to borrow your car for an hour.
I can't stop laughing.
South Africa became independent in 1961.
I think Tom's eating right now.
I could have done better.
I have some English books.
Can you make them smile?
Tom can go if he wants to.
I want to work with you.
I love wearing sports clothes.
Why were you so shy?
Tom and Mary are praising each other.
I don't even have a job.
I like to imitate Queen Elizabeth.
We should have told him the truth.
I'm so proud of them.
Who's he?
Is the supermarket open tonight?
I told Tom exactly what I saw.
Mr. Suzuki teaches us English.
What is the best way to travel?
Does Tom live here with you?
What's the matter, honey?
I don't want them angry.
Is Tom really sick?
You didn't wash your hair.
I read your letter yesterday.
Go to the supermarket once a week.
Can I marry my aunt's husband's nephew?
I believe them.
She was fun with her son's luggage.
I said it was okay.
I have no reason not to trust Tom.
He was the first to help her.
Are the kids already asleep?
We have to wait here.
I'm Chinese.
Tom wasn't very active.
We cleaned the way from the snow yesterday.
I'm not busy right now.
Tom doesn't think he'll win.
Maybe he should listen.
He's a brilliant artist.
Give me a move, guys.
I like your painting.
I waited an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like his hat.
I can't be happy when Tom's so sad.
I want to share this with you.
Study at the University of Hyogo.
We'll take part in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life was running out of trouble.
Nobody wants to help us.
They speak very quickly.
Tom was lucky at first.
It's urgent to go to the bathroom.
Mary really looks like her mother.
He didn't have the money to buy the farm.
How often do you go to the movies?
Are you religious?
Did he talk to you?
Are there a lot of sharks in these parts?
Tomorrow, if God wills, we'll be with your parents.
It comes from Sweden.
He didn't have any money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe this?
Tom decided to sell his car.
I don't like fish with lise.
I feel protected.
You're the tallest.
Isn't that funny, Tom?
Tom was born October 20th.
It's a nice picture.
I'll leave her alone.
Tom won't even look after me.
We humiliated them.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom has to sleep now.
Tom's not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.
Tom's working here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see you.
Don't break my heart.
I don't have plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic!
She was crying.
I wish I could be rich like you.
We're having fun.
It's dissatisfaction.
I read books often.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got upset.
I'm already old.
I have the dirty criminal fidin.
Good night, my friends.
I bought a book in English in a library.
Tomorrow I'm going to the bookstore to buy books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom's saying?
What's your favorite historical movie?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
You're all gone.
Giant pandas live only in China.
I'm coming along.
Don't say anything like that.
It's worse!
Jim's Canadian.
You did well here.
Where did all the others go?
I'm relaxed.
The beast was walking in the field.
He entered his private life.
Can I borrow your knife?
I'm late for an appointment.
Tom's still absent.
I ate all the apple.
Swallow the bakkri while the pen is heated.
Is the park open today?
We only prepare egg food.
We're leaving Boston tomorrow morning.
We can't leave you there.
Tom was playing soccer.
Stop chatting.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Get off your bike.
I understood it as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt a pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not an appointment.
It makes me angry.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
It's good in this game, isn't it?
Take care of them.
I live on the Fiji Islands.
You want to eat with us?
It doesn't seem too surprised.
I'm not going to school on Saturday.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom's unfaithful, isn't he?
Does this cage have the purpose of protecting against sharks?
Tom wants to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.
Don't you want a job?
I played the trumpet when I was younger.
I'm faithful.
You want to write in your bra?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate a apple.
I caught him.
He took the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Take a step forward.
You have to get more active.
Tom and Mary are kidding?
She broke out of the smoke.
I don't have an alternative.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than he is.
What's he gonna do this summer?
He became irritated.
Can you speak Shanghai?
He narrowed down because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold on to the fiat.
Am I in London?
She's still there with her, isn't she?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after the sunset.
What's your favorite rapper woman?
Hello, Tom.
It's good to see her so happy.
I usually swim in summer.
Why is he leaving soon?
I'm pretty proud of it.
I smell gas.
I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's your photo.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed its theory.
Tom's lucky.
Pass me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to her at a convention.
There are no furniture left in the room.
Tom presented himself soon for the lesson.
It's a little overcrowded, isn't it?
Who's the man playing the piano?
I decided not to.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
I slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spends all his income on drinking.
Search harder on Google!
It's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Does it look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what should I tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Will they die?
I really like it.
Are you coming in?
Tom sucked her.
I don't feel it.
She's incredibly stupid.
We're landing on a lonely island.
He wants us to be patient.
He convinced the teacher.
When does your new novel come out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unsolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?
It's snow today.
She made a promise to write me every week.
I'm not born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our son alone.
You're gonna get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love to be right.
Tom married a wealthy girl from Boston.
I forgot if you drink came or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give 50 grand for this statue. "Who will offer more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
You should have bought a used car.
I'm going to be in a hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please tell him to take care of himself.
Tom hated them.
I love it almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a hot summer night.
I always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not very fun at parties, are you?
He searched his bag for the keys to the car.
I don't really want to talk.
So he must be Argentine.
I really like my job.
I'd suggest you be more careful.
She's gone.
I should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom's dancing with Mary.
Your destiny is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
Nobody wants to help you.
It's gonna split in the afternoon.
He's blind.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
I thought it was a combination.
What do you imagine when you look at that picture?
How many continents are in the world?
It's good to sing, isn't it?
Tom's mad at Mary, isn't he?
Your idea is superior to yours.
Tom never forgave me.
I'm the expert.
Tom has a secret.
We're losing blood.
Chaucer and Boccaccio are two writers. The first is English, the second is Italian.
Tom's getting emotional.
I was just scared.
Tomorrow's a party.
I drank too much beer yesterday.
I'd like to teach you Chinese in exchange for another language.
I'm still busy.
I appreciate your intuitions.
I went to the park this morning.
Tom loves fishing in flies.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary is jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We need to inform Tom.
Tom's still asleep.
Tom's a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but whatever you want.
Can you ask Tom to stop after work?
He sounds like a drummer.
It must be hot.
Which online dictionary do you use more?
You burned the candles.
We lived in Osaka for ten years before coming to Tokyo.
No one can solve this problem.
German machines are among the best.
Call me.
What a pussy.
Tom doesn't respect Mary's opinions.
You're gonna blow the field.
He came to listen to jazz.
Do you really think Tom is nice?
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
When does school end?
Tom and I are pretty busy.
He took care of me.
I said I'd take it.
I knew they were watching me.
I have plans with them tonight.
I could meet someone who can help you.
You want to ride a bike?
These shoes are too small for me to wear.
I see a model.
You brought me a cup of tea without sugar.
It was published in 1969.
We need to relax, and that's enough.
He's talking Chinese.
Tom told me he wanted to go to Boston.
London is smaller than Tokyo.
I'm three years older than you.
Look, I'll show you.
I said it was innocent.
Fear of failure is one of the world's most widespread fears.
Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
How come you never have anything to say?
Scandalous!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep your tongue in check.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're in advance again.
We left this.
All I want to do is go fishing.
Do you want to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I'll find one later.
At least I'm older than you.
Tom didn't want to spend more time with Mary.
Tom says he kissed Mary.
You can choose what you want.
I'm at the hospital, I've been hit by a lightning.
Did you call them?
Stop the radio.
Why did you decide to become a teacher?
It was a really scary story.
It's in the van.
I don't bring them in.
Do you like golf?
Forgive me for interrupting the other day.
We're in Europe!
Wait for a bus to arrive.
He'll find the chemist.
You'll never know where I am.
I wasn't good.
Your students are required to be diligent.
I won't be able to help you.
It's a scandalous idea!
The sun disappeared behind a cloud.
You're interested in politics.
Many people go to church on Christmas Eve.
Thank you, my daughter.
I can't drive very well.
I heard Tom's learning to drive.
You know I love her deeply.
He's trying to kill himself.
I don't need your help anymore.
The problem is we don't know where Tom is.
It's under the bed, isn't it?
I dropped the branch with an ass.
The minigons are back in fashion.
There are some books on the table.
Come at least six.
I have a lot of work to finish by the weekend.
He forgot his name.
Are you Mary?
After dinner walk on the beach.
Why didn't he go with him?
He's two years older than him.
French is difficult.
I'm sure she's very busy.
My name is Ahmad.
You got the wrong number.
Age is not a result, and youth is not a sin.
I've known him for over ten years.
We are grateful for the music that left us.
It's not that the idea of putting me in the house a ammonia electrodes would attract me a lot.
Judy is a very intelligent student.
We knew the dog would run behind the cat.
I'm a cop.
You kissed him, didn't you?
Why don't I buy them a hat and that's enough?
I thought Tom would be alive.
She's full of bad news.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Are you listening, Tom?
He often shows his anger.
Tom's my dad.
We don't have to leave yet.
Do you like the mountain?
My daughter likes to play with the balls.
Come aboard.
She's fascinating.
Do people drink tea in your country?
I don't want to waste any more time.
We lost sight of him.
The hostages will be released before Christmas.
He's going to wake them up.
What tooth hurts?
You need to read between the lines.
Tom was proud.
Tom was a little unconcerned about Mary's request.
I'm here to help him.
It's not easy to speak English well.
I don't believe in a word of what you say.
Get off me!
Only Naoko drinks coffee.
Sami needed to use the bathroom.
He changed his name.
You're vulgar.
Tom's getting better.
We can help them.
They called us.
I think Tom should be hungry.
The country is rich in natural resources.
It was a difficult start for Mary.
Tom won't be back today.
You again!
Why do these things always happen to me?
Birds are beating the ground.
The park closed Monday.
Didn't you even update the firmware?
I have a job for her.
This is just a game.
Can we do that now?
I like all my friends.
I like my language.
Why don't you answer me?
We're Tom's classmates.
There's nothing better to do.
Tom started writing.
That's what I'm looking for.
He's doing practice.
You're coming in?
Which way should I start?
Have you studied Darwin's evolution theory?
His horse had a heart attack.
It's worth visiting the ruins.
He should be ready for the worst.
Tom pulled the bags out of the trunk.
That reminds me of someone.
I'm so hungry.
Tom lost his new watch.
Tom sang with Mary.
Is that what you told Tom?
Do you remember her number?
He told us a lie.
She has seven children.
Let's listen to the music.
I think it's dangerous for kids to play in the pond.
You bought me a nice hat.
The bell sounded.
Bring him to the men in room 318.
I'm in love with you.
We have to post our departure.
Tom doesn't even care.
We smoke separately.
It's very soon.
You saved Tom twice.
I don't like big cities.
That's what I got.
He doesn't have a few friends in America.
I didn't live in Boston last year.
Do you read this book tonight?
Does Tom have a car?
I'll be fine, don't worry.
Tom laughs rarely.
I can't forget his smile.
I disobeyed him.
Do you know Canadians who live in Australia?
Tom's drunk, isn't he?
I'm perfectly happy here.
Do you like it?
What do you want Tom to do exactly?
Listen, we need to talk.
Tom didn't like it very much.
Can you wash the dishes, please?
The lunch was great.
She turned off the computer.
Torture is against the law.
I remembered that.
It's not impossible.
What does he want me to do?
You should have shared a bedroom with your sister.
You heard the door shut.
He made it drink.
How did you feel today?
Would you be interested in working for me?
It reminds me of my childhood.
Mary and Alice were like sisters.
Tom came to Boston last night.
You're soaring.
I don't feel nervous.
She's got a good dog.
What do you really want to do?
Tom doesn't even leave Mary's letter.
They were perfect.
What are you going to do this summer?
You're going to my house.
But the wolf with his ball reached the quiet Fido.
Tom is engaged to my older sister.
My father always interferes with my private life.
Everyone wants something different.
Tom refused to execute the order.
I know you don't like me.
I didn't know about his plan.
Why don't you go back to Boston?
I don't want to be away from home.
How about we go out for a walk after dinner?
Fight like a man!
Tom and Mary sing?
Tom and Mary are okay?
Contracting is common in the markets.
They shot him.
We're sorry about the inconvenience.
Tom was looking for his pen.
I don't want you to see this.
How many kidneys has a human being?
A saved money is a earned money.
We're not cold.
We need to talk to him.
I know his name.
It's gone with red.
Don't bother them.
We were good.
She started acting weird.
You should ask Tom to help.
Who sent the flowers?
Do I owe you money?
Would you like me to go?
You left this, didn't you?
Say something.
You're random.
Please lower the music.
I'm training Tom for work.
I was watching him swim.
Who broke the vase?
You'd better go with him.
The queen visited the museum.
Tom didn't go, and neither did I.
Would you like to leave a message?
The children sound together.
Say it again, please.
You're bothering her.
Sami is not here to ruin your day.
You're taking my shoes off.
I'm learning the esperante now.
He took mercenaries to kill Sami.
Those are hers?
The woman drinks water now.
Tom was a lawyer.
People who are in need of what they eat, so even if a restaurant is cheap, it will soon close down the bats if the food does not taste good.
The man they're talking to Tom and Mary is a lawyer.
He's changed his diet.
He's a man of words.
I'm free tonight.
Do you think I'm too tall?
What should we do now?
Tom tried a new technique.
Were you blessed?
Are you interested?
Tom cut his wrists.
You look up.
You should have kissed Tom.
I know I'm wrong.
I'm looking for my keys.
Will you join our club?
Don't fire Tom.
He doesn't listen.
I bought it in a store.
Why don't you do it alone?
He's finally here!
Tom thinks they'll all be here by noon.
Why don't you work with me anymore?
It doesn't matter.
You're lying.
She helped him.
Everyone was talking about it.
Are you telling me you're not busy?
He hates the blues.
Go home.
Tom told me Mary was busy.
Where's my money?
No one's seen it.
Tom hasn't read any of these books.
You're still inexperienced.
I have to go to work now.
You've come too soon.
He's capable of speaking ten languages.
Come home before dark.
I got off the train to the wrong station.
I hated the French above.
Shouldn't you be home with your mother?
He's got blue eyes and blonde hair.
I can't understand.
Tell him who you are.
My name seems crazy.
I'll never forget that night.
Be happy! Add a exclamatory point to all your phrases!
Can you see something in there?
You're ready.
Why should I talk to them?
I won't forget.
I don't want to forget her.
I can't open it!
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
I bought a pair of shoes.
I started working here in 2013.
They're traitors.
I'll stay.
I'm not always engaged.
I'll be with you.
You raised me before dawn.
I'll be right behind you.
How long have you lived in Kobe?
We're getting closer.
Tom always says the same thing.
Did you talk to Tom?
Try to rest a little.
Do you have a Facebook account?
Churches like cooking fish.
No one will believe his story.
Tom's a gold boy.
It seems to be prevented from coming from foreign countries.
I bought that book for him.
I didn't mean to hit Tom so hard.
She's making me vomit.
I want a doctor.
What does the cat want?
You'll meet her tomorrow.
You're three years younger than Tom.
Complete the sentence.
The clock's broken.
I won't wait forever.
Just give the order.
Do you know Canadians who live in Australia?
This book is much more interesting than that.
We were obliged to obey the rule.
I hope Tom's not angry.
The rock was moved with the dynamite.
Mary prepared the breakfast.
Where did you meet my father?
Who was Mona Lisa?
He said he had to go.
You can have them.
This smell is unbearable.
He became famous.
What are you suggesting?
You became a friend to him while I was in Taiwan.
He was terrified of his intelligence.
She scored the ball.
We have to go.
Staying at home isn't fun.
I'm sure Tom will be awake.
She can't find her hat.
Mr Young would like his son to study more.
I opened an account in a bank near here.
I don't like that one.
Can you be sure?
I was happy to see her.
You don't have to worry.
We'll be close.
I'm really worried about them.
He wants to go clearly.
I knew Tom would do something romantic.
How much card does he need?
Can you confirm that?
It was a waste of money.
Tom's talking to Mary on the phone.
Take the wine.
I was very proud.
You're too fast.
What about a beer?
I had no idea you were so stupid.
They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You're a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It only costs one coin.
I hope Tom and Mary make a mistake.
My kitchen is too big!
Give them a minute.
We eat together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Take a picture.
You're my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where did he eat?
It's the last person who can say a lie.
June isn't that far, either.
Why does Tom hate so much?
Do you know who said that?
I'm going to bed soon tonight.
He chased me out of the house.
My shoes got wet.
The key was left in the room.
You're leaving me?
You always like Tom.
Why do you care?
Give him a hand, okay?
Did he want to ask me questions?
Don't play Tom.
You'll land on your feet.
I've been taking risks.
Two people were killed in a road accident.
You know Tom, right?
It wasn't my idea to take them.
Last night my grandmother was missing without suffering.
I know why you're mad at them.
You know Tom likes cars.
She passed the exam.
Tom imitated Mary.
I can easily read Spanish.
Do I have to use ink?
Don't fall off the chair.
Tom sent us Christmas gifts.
Can't Tom swim?
Children usually get up early in Christmas.
I'll be your guide.
How long do you study English every day?
Why does he think he's against it?
I can't do anything for her.
Father's good.
I think they're ready.
Tom will try it again.
What a wonderful woman!
They played a table game.
They all believed him.
It means a huge increase in the use of air conditioning, which uses energy, costs money and creates pollution.
I'm a drug addict.
Those are crocodile tears.
He might have said something before.
The job leaves tracks on Tatoeba...
Do you like carrots?
I have pain every 30 minutes.
Tom is much older now.
Tom's better.
I think Tom is pessimistic.
You have to help them.
I used to write to my mother.
Don't trust anyone.
I'm sorry I've never been kind to him.
Make Tom call me.
It didn't change anything.
She's not wearing her hat.
Tom actually apologized to Mary.
Why doesn't he sit with me anymore?
I want you to look for them.
I left the party too soon.
I should have eaten more.
Twenty students, only one read the book.
To love someone means to see him as God understood him.
Don't lie to them.
Do they live with her?
I don't know how I did this.
I'm not sure George's gonna like this idea.
They're afraid to say it publicly.
Please, identify yourself.
You're leaving us.
It would be nice to spend the summer in the mountains.
I lost it.
I almost dropped the dishes.
There's a phone in my room.
Is it serious?
Tom made 911.
We're brothers and sisters.
Is she interested in Buddhism?
It's been nice this week.
You want a vase with that?
She doesn't know me.
Nobody wants to work.
Please drive slower.
How do we do that?
This is the magazine of last month.
They're not back yet.
He's about your age, isn't he?
He's retired.
We can't let them die.
It's a nerve band.
Tom came late.
Tom stayed back.
This point will be discussed tomorrow.
How did he spend his holidays?
When he left the Army, Roger Miller moved to the country music house in Nashville, Tennessee.
Mary made it right.
Have you ever talked to him?
I don't think Tom will be able to do that.
When are you back from London?
Tom's always good at it.
Can I get you some coffee?
He left the village to study.
I've never seen you dance.
Tom's gone for a closer look.
Can you save them?
So you and Hanna are thinking about getting married?
You can drive, can you?
They need us to finish the job.
I've been here twice now.
It looks so subtle.
They're all dead.
I don't want you in my car.
A snake bites Tom.
I don't care about you.
Don't say anything!
I think you're right.
He likes football.
Tom lives next to Mary.
I have to go to Boston next week.
Show them how to do it.
