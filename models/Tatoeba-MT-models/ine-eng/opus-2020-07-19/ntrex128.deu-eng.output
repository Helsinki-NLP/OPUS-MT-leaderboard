Members of the National Assembly for Wales are afraid of confusion with the Muppets
In the case of some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to amend their title in MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Wallisian Parliament).
It is for this reason that plans are to change the name of the National Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
National Assembly members of all political directions are afraid to become targets of the spot.
One of the National Assembly members of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because the name “with “Twp” and “Pwp” is hugged”.
For non-valisive readers: In Welsh there is "twp" for "doof" and "pwp" for "Aa".
A national assembly member from Plaid Cymru said that the whole group was "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the change of name, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is spoken in the English language spoken in Yorkshire, similar to the English letter u.
The Assembly Committee (National Assembly Committee), which is currently drafting a law on amendments to the names, said: "The final decision on the names of the members of the National Assembly is of course the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorised the Wallisian National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Board published the results of a public hearing on the proposals from which broad support for the name ‘Welsh Parliament’ for the National Assembly was drawn up.
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Welsh Parliament Members (Walisian Members) or WMPs preferred the largest support for the MWP option at a public hearing.
The National Assembly members appear to propose alternative options, but the call for a consensus for President Elin Jones to present a bill within weeks could be a problem.
The Law on Reforms will include further changes to the way in which the National Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of members of the National Assembly and on the design of the Committee system.
The members of the National Assembly can finally vote on their names in their debate on the Law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change in the name of the country
The voters decide on Sunday whether to change the name of their country in the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was set to create a decade-long dispute with the neighbouring Greek country, which has a province with the same name as Macedonia.
For a long time, Athens has been saying that the name of its northern neighbour means that it raises this claim in the Greek field, and has repeatedly spoken against its inclusion in the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Mr Ivanov, opposed the vote on the amendment, said he would not accept the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name of accession to the EU and NATO is the price to be paid.
The bells of St. Martin's in view of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people I spoke to said that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," Adams said.
"There is no both of us today."
He said that the disappearance of the bars was possible.
"People's social life looks different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people are regularly present."
He fears that the money from the sale of assets does not last as long as the church leaders accept, and that they will “be at the beginning sooner or later”.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments with properties in which people living who do not support the remaining shelters.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy properties in these buildings will be white," he said, "and in order to accelerate the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who enter these properties will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community came out in the 1930s.
A black community that took up their services nearby became owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem, who refused to set up or support blacks.
In a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's community members planned the reconstruction, they ordered the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly referred to the bells as "the bells of the poor".
The expert, who played the bell game in July, used other words: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first world-class bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had changed 18 years ago to the larger bell in the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has been played in the last few months in St. Martin's is a complicated story with architects and contractors who have been taken as part of the lay leaders of the church and as part of the bishop diocese.
In July, the Board of Commons – the board of directors of the municipality of Lainführer – expressed written concerns about the diocese that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the Board of Commons, although it was not involved in the commission of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members of the congregation complain about lack of transparency on the sides of the diocese.
Hai injured in California 13-year-olds while diving to Lobstern
In California on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, according to official statements, a 13-year-old kid attacked a shark while diving after Lobster.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the broadcaster KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been with friends for about half an hour on the dive on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cry of help and rode with several others to the boy to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought that the boy was glad to have caught a praiser. But then he recognized that the boy shouted, “I was bitten!
I'm fucked!".
When he arrived at the boy's hamlet, he found that his whole cell bone had been broken up.
"I wrote that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’ added Hammel.
The boy was rushed to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego and is in a critical state.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Rescue Swim Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier. However, it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials stopped for investigation and for security reasons 48 hours the beach access of Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Encinitas.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans ahead of the cosmetic market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's attacks cosmetic departments that are located in shopping houses with specialized assistants, boats, superdrugs and Debenhams.
As part of a major effort on the UK's 2.8 billion-pound cosmetic market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow, while fashion and household goods come back, the larger cosmetic distributions will be tested in eleven branches throughout the country. If they prove successful, they will be extended to other branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics is linked with the search for supermarkets to make different use of charging surfaces used for television, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, the scope of its cosmetic offer is doubled for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also available series of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees get more space and brand areas similar to those in shops like boats.
In addition, the supermarket conducts a relaunch of its makeup series "Boutique" so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly required by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test in two Sainsbury's branch sales outlets. The first sales outlet was opened last week in Croydon in southern London, and a second one will be opened in the course of this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local retail stores means that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, sales outlets will increasingly look like shopping houses, as the supermarket chain tries to fight against the discounter Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has established a number of habitat sales outlets in hundreds of Argos sales outlets two years ago. This has increased the food supply and the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments broke out.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats early in the year 2000, but ended up after a dispute over the distribution of revenues from the drug dealer's branches in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branching pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million British pounds three years ago.
The company indicated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan when an extended palette with luxurious skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, is added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, a sales director at Sainsbury's said: "We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetic departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand palette is tailored to all needs. Due to the attractive environment and the affordable locations, we are now an attractive goal for cosmetics purchases, which calls into question the previous type of purchase."
Peter Jones "excited" after the withdrawal of Holly Willoughbys from a business worth 11 million British pounds
"Dragons" The "Star Peter Jones is "suffering", after the TV moderator Holly Willoughby withdrew from a business worth 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand True.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Mark Goop.
The "This Morning" moderator, 37, announced their withdrawal to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby crushed "Dragons" The Star Peter Jones by her extremely short-term withdrawal from her elusive lifestyle brand company to focus on her own new connections with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was supposed to be angry when the "Golden Girl" of television was added during an intense discussion on Tuesday at the center of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, due to its new business – in the value of up to 1.5 million British pounds – the common homewear and accessory brand Truely can no longer devote enough time.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Mark Goop and would have probably doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million British pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from True at Instagram, left Jones Great Britain on the way to one of his holiday missiles.
One source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly at a distance.
It should ensure their long-term future over the next decades.
Your decision to withdraw was completely surprising for all the participants.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the launch of the market.
In the center of Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the "This Morning" moderator, which is one of Britain's most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market introduction.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been closely friends for ten years with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded True in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, came in March as president.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a 40% share of Baldwins TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as moderator of the ITV broadcast "I'm A Celebrity".
A nearby source of Jones said last night: "We do not comment on his business matters."
Hard words "and then we fell in love"
He complained about the criticism he would expect from the news media for a comment that some would view as 'non-presidential' and for such positive statements about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said that the voice of a news moderator follows:
"I gave up nothing."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore in June of Trump was celebrated as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the denuclearisation negotiations have come to the fore.
Over three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the top North Korean diplomat, said on Saturday to leading politicians from all over the world on the occasion of the UN General Assembly that the North did not see the US 'consistent reaction' to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he found that the United States had imposed sanctions to maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We faced a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: the end of the rocket tests, support for the release of hostages and the re-transmission of the mortal remnant of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing here,” Trump said and showed the people directly to him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastated an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok were displaced, no national emergency was declared a prerequisite for the mobilization of international aid.
"In many cases, however, they have made it very clear that they do not require international support, so this is something difficult," said the survey.
While Save the Children are preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work on the spot.
Sutopo, spokesperson for the Disaster Protection Authority, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu as to whether international bodies should participate in the relief measures.
In view of the earthquakes with which Indonesia has been constantly fighting, the country is still being prepared for a tragicly bad natural violence.
While Tsunami protection accommodation was built in Aceh, these are not everyday sights at other coastal zones.
Despite a warning in force, apparently missing tsunamis in Palu have probably contributed to the deaths.
Travels between Indonesia and many islands already pose a challenge in the best case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A Lazaret ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the place of the new catastrophe in three days earlier.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the affected Indonesian infrastructure a core part of his campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
The government of the next year, however, suffers from funding deficits.
Joko is also under pressure from constant confessional tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of people were expelled from their homes and homes when bands from Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machetes, arrows and bows as well as other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge achieves deep compensation against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at the London Stamford Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1 stand of his team in about 27 meters away from the Chelsea gate.
He shot the ball to the left and then shot him towards the back of the pit.
The shooter sailed high above the penalty and drove to the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I’ve just tried to bring myself in this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I’ve just tried to create as much time as possible for me,” said Sturridge against LiverpoolFC.com.
"I came to see edge and had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just accepted the gun."
Chelsea led after a hit in the 25th minute by the Belgian Star Eden Hazard for a half-time with 1:0.
The Blues storm gave a pass with the verse back to Mateo, then turned off near the middle field and sprinkled half into the Liverpool.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the middle field.
Then he shot a good style pass, so Hazard got into the courtroom.
Hazard left the defendant behind and locked up with a left-hand shot at Liverpool's Alison Becker in the back of the net.
Liverpool plays at the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples.
Chelsea stands at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday in London at the UEFA Europe League Videoton.
The number of Tsunami deaths in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, as reported by the accident protection authority on Sunday morning.
Many people were to be caught in the drums of buildings, which were brought to an intrusion by the earthquake of the force 7.5 from Friday, which had triggered up to six meters high waves, reported the official speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was translated with the drums of broken buildings.
Police take a man, 32, for murder suspicion, after a woman has been raped
After the discovery of a female body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. with stabs in Grayson Mews in John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for murder suspicion.
The police ask the residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I ask everyone who has stayed close to John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask all the persons, especially taxi drivers, who may have made contact with a Dashcam. They may have information that is of major importance to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
Today afternoon, friends who believe that the woman was found in the tator to explore where she was found this morning.
The investigation was ongoing, and the police informed that it was about to inform the next members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get to his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours until they can enter the building again.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that the whole area is now being treated as a tattoo.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the place of the incident.
She repeats again and again, “it’s so scary.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the lockdown and another vehicle before the lockdown.
Several police officers were inside the lockdown who were watching the block.
Persons with information will be asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers under number 0800 555 111 anonymous and to refer to Protocol 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue before Parliament becomes the newest monument to the dispute over the rewriting of history
Their ban would be poetic justice for its destruction to the Taliban of so many cultural and religious artists of England by its fanatic Puritan adherents.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "torthing" and "probably rewriting the story".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell became the goal of the Palace of Westminster.
The image tower in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have sacrificed for the deeds of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence to be celebrated for the 19th century's dominant opinion and part of the historical writing of a figure that is still worth it to many.
Goldsmith said regarding Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is defended by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century more than today, than anyone who considers Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case naturally by the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully relevant presentation is the subject of further historical debates.
It is certain that in the middle of the 17th century the conflict formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure that represents one side of this scourge.
Its services as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering them."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China.
The man, to whom only the last name ‘Yuan’ was referred, was found dead with a blood flow through a separated artery near a pig market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject pigs vaccine in Xining, Qinghai Province, China on 30 May 2005.
According to reports on Wednesday, he was driving with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door was open to a nearby pigyard.
He said that in the stable, a large male pig with blood was found on the snause.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that the 250 kilos of heavy pigs had consumed the farmers.
"The legs of my cousins were bloody and muzzled," was quoted by the cousin, who was named after the name "Wu", by the Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man belonged neither to Yuan nor to his cousin.
One market manager said the Evening News, the pig was blocked to prevent attacks on other people, while the police collected evidence at the Tatort.
Yuan's family and the market authorities negotiate reports on compensation for his death.
Although it is rare that pigs attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290-kilometer-hard pig caught a whale farmer between himself and a tractor until the woman of the farmer was able to swallow the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs were normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a "launcher".
“They are only played.
They're happy and are very curious, ... they're not about to hurt anyone.
You only have to treat them with the right measure of respect," he said.
The rest of Hurricane Rosa brings widespread strong rains to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurrikan Rosa weakens on the way over the colder water on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring floods of rain to North Mexico and the South West of the United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 a.m., the east-west time of Rosa showed wind speeds of 136 km/h, corresponding to a category 1 hurricane, and was 620 kilometres south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the Pacific begins to form a path that leads east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, high tropical humidity is transported north into the Southwest of the United States.
Rosa is triggered on Monday in parts of Mexico up to 25 centimeters of precipitation.
Then, in the coming days, the tropical humidity creates widespread strong rainfall in the southwest due to interactions with the adjacent Trog.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation can cause dangerous fluctuating floods, water-driving protection and possibly soil in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, in particular in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation is expected.
Due to the fluctuation of tropical precipitation, there is the possibility of fluctuating flooding with rapidly worsening conditions.
In view of the threatening tropical defeats, it is urgent to stop walking into the desert.
Strong rainfall can lead to the flow of canyon, and winds bring local winds as well as wind that leads the dust with it.
The nearby Trog brings strong rains locally in parts of the coast of southern California.
A total of more than one centimeter can be used, which can lead to a low level of water-driving protection and smooth roads.
This would be the first defeat of the rainy season in this region.
The first single tropical rain shows reach Arizona on Sunday and Monday. On Monday and Tuesday it rains.
On Tuesday, strong rains spread into the Four-Corners region and stopped on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools, while the drops remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example in the middle of the United States of America for drastic temperature differences.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next few days, the constant summer heat tries to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the central and eastern United States, a warmer beginning of October with widespread temperatures is expected at 27 oC from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high probability of over-average temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the United States.
Over 20 million viewers have seen Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
Over 20 million viewers saw on Thursday at six television networks the festive statements of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political patsituation began. On Friday, TV broadcasters interrupted their regular program for a change in the last minute: a deal negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, and the FBI should therefore carry out a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, that she had stressed and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure this didn't happen.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company detected the average viewers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network that had broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring audiences in offices.
To get this back to the right perspective: This corresponds to, for example, the number of spectators at a play-off football game or at the Oscar award.
The sender Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support the nomination of Kavanaughs, listed Nielsen with an average of 5.69 million viewers of the entire day hearing the highest numbers of all networks.
ABC came to second place with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS reported that Nielsen had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest continued to grow after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican had published a statement that he would therefore vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by CNN and CBS, as protestors in the chair on the way to a hearing of the Committee of Justice strongly challenged him with words.
He stood for a minute with a reduced view while he was trained. The scene was transmitted live at CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you believe that he tells the country the truth?"
"They have power, while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said his office had published a statement and added before the chair closed that he would have more to say in the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks sent hours later live than the Judicial Committee should vote on the continuation of the nomination of Kavanaughs to the entire Senate.
Flake said, however, that he would do this only on the condition that the FBI, like the democratic minority, would be required to investigate the charges against the candidates next week.
Flake was partly convinced by interference with a friend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an intrusion with coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flakes' decision was of great importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes without the investigation for the confirmation of Kavanaugh.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the charges brought against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May accused in an interview with the Sunday Times critic of their plans for the withdrawal from the European Union, the future of Britain for political purposes and undermining the interests of the nation in an interview.
British Prime Minister Theresa May meets on September 29, 2018 at the Conservative Party in Birmingham.
In addition to her interview published on the title page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called "Checkers Plan" for Brexit, by proposing that the mutual entry of duties through Britain and the EU be regarded as "very absurd".
Killing shots on Wayde Sims: Police take suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shots on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested after reports of Baton Rouge police.
The authorities published video recordings of the clash between Sims and Simpson. According to the police Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As reported by the CBS partner station WAFB, the police secured the glasses on the tattoo and said that the glasses were found at Simpson's DNA.
After a question, Simpsons told the police that he had been standing on Wayde's deadly shots.
The lawyer reports that the bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, which said the cause of death was a gunshot wound on the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the criminal lab of the federal police, the Southern University Police and the people in the area for their support in the investigation leading to arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the regional law enforcement authority for 'their care and their pursuit of justice'.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m big wing player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played for the LSU basketball.
In the last season he achieved an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach, Will Wade, said that the team was "deeply scared" and "stand under shock".
"Before that, you're always afraid," Wade said.
Volcano sucks ash in Mexico City.
Ash emitted from the Volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity in Krater increased and 183 gas and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of frogs and shellfish.
Pictures in social media showed thin ash layers on the windshields of cars in quarters of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have established, since September 2017, an earthquake of 7.1 central Mexico, increased activity at the 72 kilometres south-east of the capital.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between the police and Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the independence poll
In Barcelona, six persons were arrested on Saturday after clashes between the PD and the Pro-Independence Demonstrators. Thousands took part in other demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the polarising independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, who were detained by the security police, buried them with eggs and also slammed colour powder, so that dark dust clouds were created in the streets normally inhabited by tourists.
In the course of the next day, there was also handcuffs with the police who used their bullets to slow down the fights.
Several hours of scandalous pro-independence groups "No forgetting, no forgiveness" were confronted by Unionists who called "long live Spain".
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries in protests.
However, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which was seen by Madrid as illegal, by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The voters had decided by a overwhelming majority on independence, although the election participation was low, as the dissidents boycotted most of the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes in front of the hooligans.
Pro-independence groups had camped in the open on Friday night to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to take another path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the separatists' protest, said he saw the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out of joy because they could choose, but now we're stuck," he said.
In spite of an important, but hardly, victory in the last December regional elections, the Catalan pro-independence parties had difficulties maintaining the momentum this year. Many of their most well-known leaders are either in exile or in prison, where they wait for their procedures because of their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was cut off by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in investigation since the end of the last year, announced his candidacy for election to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, it is the best way to push down democratic values and repression by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after the car house was destroyed
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a house in Londonderry was built by a car several times.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 a.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the doors and the building themselves were damaged.
In addition, it may have been shot on the car with an armbrush.
Menga hit means for Livingston 1:0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Mengas' first door for Livingston won the victory.
The uplifted Livingstone FC surprised the rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas hit proved crucial to Gary Holt's team being able to compete with hibernian in the second half of the year.
This season, Gerard's team remains without a win in the Premiership and faces the hearts that fall back on the next Sunday.
Previously on Thursday, the rangers in the Europa League are hosts for Rapid Vienna.
In the meantime, Livingstone can increase its winning series in the division to six games, which means that Cheftrainer Holt has not been downgrading since his acquisition of Kenny Miller in the last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against freely playing guests
Holt's team should have been in charge for a long time before the hit, since its direction put the rangers in front of the various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, however, slowed down before the door. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he had entered to meet Craig Halket's head shot at the door.
The hosts agreed to let the rangers play ahead, as they knew that they could prevent the guests in standard situations.
In this way the decisive gate came to stand.
The Rangers left a release, and Livingstone prepared a chance to bring Menga together at Declan Gallagher and Robinson, which shot the door with a ball connection from the center of the penalty.
At this stage, the rangers had dominated the ball ownership, but could not overcome the resistance of the host, and Torhüter Liam Kelly remained largely inconceivable.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly was forced once to resist.
Scott Pittman was rejected by Rangers-Torhüter Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow closed the ball from another standard situation in Livingstone.
Flangs have always returned to the prison of Livingstone and have been regularly taken out of the danger area, while two required fines – one by Halkett against the confused Glenn Middleton and one by hand – have been refused.
"Phenomenal" by Livingstone – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingstone.
They were excellent without exception and have again exceeded the expectations of this upward trend.
Her playing style and team have barely changed since her return to the top teams, but Holt has paid a great praise for the way in which he has guarded the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were at work throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they were sometimes under Gerard, they couldn't reach this standard.
Her last ball was not enough – only once they were able to pass through the host team – and this is something like a call for the rangers in the middle of the table.
Receive Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), smiling faces and blue sky ruled when the government chief of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to repair relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes about issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and EU accession to Turkey.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called security reasons for holding a 25,000 people strong enough to gather in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters found themselves nearby to see their presidents.
Hundreds of anti-erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurden – also became members. They condemned Erdogan's politics as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The opposite protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, which is praised by some German Turks as heroes and mocked by others as autocrats.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Cycling Dies at Car crash
In a car crash, a biker came to life in London.
The crash took place around 10:15 a.m. in British summer time near the crossing of Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver stopped the car, and the ambulances took care of the man who died in the accident.
A month before the accident, another bike driver was killed by an accident with a driver's flight in the Children Street, about 1.6 kilometres from the accident on Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and notify his next family.
Roadblocks and routes for buses are set up, and the driver has been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: Six officers injured in unrest
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in an unrest prison for men.
The unrest broke out on Sunday around 9:30 p.m. in British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and still stopped.
Specialized "Tornado" officials were added to end the unrests of eight seats and restricted to one wing.
Officials were treated locally for minor injuries in the face.
One spokesperson for the Prison Service said: “A specially trained prison staff was used to resolve a still ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and we want to make it clear that the police officers will be handed over and perhaps spent longer behind bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was treated after an attack by a prisoner in the hospital.
In October last year, officials were sent to prison to deal with severe unrest, with which the staff was attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with fluctuating floods (probably profiting areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression is achieved in Arizona, but that is what is likely to happen next week when the rest of Hurricane Rosa pull over the southwests of the desert and bring the risk of fluctuating floods with them.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of floating floods on Monday and Tuesday from west of Arizona to south and east of Nevada, as well as to the south-east of California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to get closer to rain on Monday and on Tuesday directly across Phoenix.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cycles have come close as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a Hurricane within 64 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation with a single to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest, including the central rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely and can be simplified to up to 10 centimeters in total.
For those who do not have the risk of fluctuating floods, the precipitation associated with Rosa may be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, these rains are likely to be useful in part because they are now in the south-west of Dürre.
According to the U. S. Drought Monitor, at least 40 percent of Arizona's extreme drought occurs, the second highest category", said weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane means that Rosa will meet on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have herring strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometres per hour and is 620 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Afterwards, the herring will move 19 kilometres per hour north.
In the Pacific, the storm will meet on colder water and thus weaken.
Therefore, it is expected that Rosa will meet on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on the ground.
The precipitations can be strong in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the north-west of the Sonora desert, precipitation amounts of 7.5 to 15 centimeters are expected, with up to 25 centimeters possible," said weather.com.
Then Rosa will move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the border of Arizona early Tuesday as a tropical depression, and then move through Arizona to the south of Utah until the late service evening.
“As a major risk, very strong defeats in Baja California, the north-west of the Sonora Desert and the south-west of the United States are expected in connection with Rosa or its survivors,” the National Hurricane Center reported.
As a result of these defeats, in the desert life-threatening fluctuating floods and in water-driving protection as well as in mountainous areas are expected Earthquake.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
After the end of a 16-year-old with stabbings in Somerset, three boys were arrested in their teens and a 20-year-old man under the suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital and his condition is "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight by the Avon and Somerset police.
The officials asked all those who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was "under the community, the anger" of the Democrats.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the skrupulous and unstoppable tactics of the Democrats," Trump said in a broadcast in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during the entire nomination process, Kavanaugh had suffered "under the community, wrath" of the Democrats.
Kavanaugh said on Thursday in front of the Congress and showed that Christine Blasey Ford was guilty of sexual harassment, and he had harassed them decades ago, when both teenagers were.
Ford also stated in the hearing that she had been accused.
On Saturday, the President said that the American people saw the Brillanz, the quality and the courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
"A voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for the confirmation of one of the most experienced juridical heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance in the service of the public," he said the number of his followers in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't come in, but in fact I come in," he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats were looking at their mission to "resistance and block".
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place at the latest on Friday in the Senate, a senior member of the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of earthquakes killed in Indonesia, victims increase
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were drowned when, due to a strong earthquake and tsunami, giant waves hit the beaches on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at a party on the beach of Palu, when up to six meters high waves hit the beach, and many people died and destroyed everything that was in their way.
The Tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the threat came through the tsunami yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately, and they fell victim to it," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Disaster Protection Authority BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, he swam cars, wooden stables and houses with it, he hit the ground all," Nugroho said. He added that the tsunami was pulled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
Some people on the flight before the tsunami were climbing on trees and had survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated and housed in 24 centers in Palu.
Many destroyed buildings and shops, curved and destroyed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water, published by the accident protection authority.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shot by other neighbours.
The Earthquake series was to be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that energy released from the massive wave of Friday was the 200th energy component of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have increased, the authorities said.
Nugroho described the damage as “inclusive” and indicated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found under the drums of broken buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 were lost.
Nugroho said the number of victims and the damage along the coast could have been higher 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the baby.
The communication with Dongalla was completely corrupted by Nugrohos's words, and there was no information.
According to a statement of the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," said the statement.
On Saturday, the Authority was repeatedly criticised for not being informed that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves reported official data at the time of the warning.
Amateur footage published in social media show a man on the top floor of a building who is desperate to call the people on the street under him in front of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall enters the river and swims in buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately check the authenticity of the recordings.
As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, there was a massive power crash that interrupted the communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities with support, but the evacuated still need food and other vital goods.
The airport of the city remains closed until October and has only been reopened for aid measures.
For Sunday a visit by President Joko Widodo was planned in evacuation centres in Palu.
The number of Tsunami victims has increased to over 800.
The situation is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Dongalla arrived safely at the city of Palu, where the employees were accommodated in tenthouses in the inner courtyard of their office, but after Dosebabas, they went on their way to scenes of desertification.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the relief teams began with the hard task of launching disaster relief, some demonstrated that experts from abroad would prevent the trip to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible if the site of an accident has been declared to be a national disaster area.
This has not happened so far.
"At the moment it is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international support.
While the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami fell from Friday over Palu, friends and family of the still missing people hoped for these on one of the wonders that revealed the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue forces release a woman who had been stabbed for two days by drummers next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian Paragliding National Team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the beginning of this month in Indonesia to complete Asian games.
Others were prisoners at Roa-Roa-Hotel, as Mandagi added, his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how in the hours after the message of the Roa-Roa-Hotel's interference under the paraglids made the rounds, disappointed whatsapp news had sent to the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach party.
However, his messages led instead to blue hooks only to gray question marks.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Steal 26.750 US dollars while filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release by the Newport police, on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee Diebe stole an employee from Brink’s while filling in a cash machine 26.750 US dollars.
The driver of the vehicle had learned a computer in the entertainment complex and wanted to deposit more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, "a man came behind the staff of Brink's" and stole a bag full of money that was intended for the machines.
According to the press release, several suspects fled the Tator, but the police did not know how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information on the identity of suspects will be asked to contact the Newport police under 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name – in Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The beings officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been the top label of Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eight albums published in June.
The change presupposes his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He is acting as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the manufacturer's information, gave out "emotional reasons".
The word is not only abbreviation of its current professional name, but it has religious significance for the West itself.
“I think “ye” is the word most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “du””, West said this year in a conversation about his album with RadioModerator Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
From Kanye, which means “the only one”, only “Yes” became a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album reflects rather what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known under the name Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with the West, has already written his name with and without string and letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military violence against the civilian population, while the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students in his country approaches.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza "never to use the military to suppress the Mexican people".
On 2 October 1968, soldiers had set fire to a peaceful demonstration in the square and killed 300 people. At that time left-wing students were in the process of establishing themselves in all Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans through monthly student assistance and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training led to youth criminal gangs.
USA should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of China's enhanced activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the USA should double its research expenditure in this field, says Investor and KI-practice Kai-Fu Lee, who was active in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow KI announcements from different areas of the US government, even if the US generally lacks a formal KI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: The country intends to become the number 1 in the area of KI innovation by 2030.
"The duplication of the KI research budget would be due to the fact that all other countries are so far behind the USA, a good start. We are looking for the next KI breakthrough," Lee said.
The duplication of the financial resources could double the chances that the next major KI success in the USA would be achieved, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's leading KI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University on a KI system that won the highest-ranking U.S. Othello player. Later he was the leader of Microsoft Research and President of the Google site in China.
Lee appreciated previous technology competitions from the U.S. government such as the Robotics Challenge of Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked after the time of the next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lees, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
"China does not take away the academic superpowers, but the companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have set up corypheans from universities to work on KI in recent years.
According to Lees, an amended immigration policy in the USA could also be supportive of the US's KI efforts.
"I think that people promoted by KI should be offered Greencards automatically," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of KI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lees, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people in academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to give money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the US Ministry of Defence founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to participate in the partner from industry and science. The White House also announced the formation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month the investment of $2 billion in the "AI Next" initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million a year in the KI research.
In the meantime, U.S. laws have not done anything about the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on a change in the name of the country
On Sunday, the population of Macedonia agreed in a referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed in "the Republic of North Macedonia", which would present a decade-old dispute with Greece, which blocked Macedonia's applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that it raises this claim in the Greek territory. Therefore, Greece has put a veto against Macedonia's inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name. Nationalist opponents argue, however, that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign raises doubts as to whether the vote will reach 50 percent of the vote required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the voting list was: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name to which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev belongs argue that Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth the price in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the European Union, because this means a safe life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result is not legally binding, many Members have said that they would stick to the result so that it is crucial.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said that there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the vote was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 per cent of registered voters voting.
"I am here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voters in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018 in the referendum on the change of country name, which Macedonia would open the way for accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs to tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we would like to join the high level, not through the back entrance," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can join others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership will result in urgent investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that there will be a large majority for this because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
According to him, a 'yes' result would be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote with "yes".
In order for the referendum to be successful, the vote must be at 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first severe blow to the policy of the provincial government since its takeover in May.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvered through the entire Brighton rebellion to reach a gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling passed on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester the Brighton-Demons at the 2:0 victory of Manchester City.
Aguero made his hit in the 65th minute look ridiculously simple.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle field.
He ran between three Brighton fighters and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green tricots.
He played around a defender and then picked up several other defenders on the edge of Brighton's punishment.
Then he shot a pass to the left of Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penalty room to play the ball back to Aguero, who took over with his right boot Brighton-Torhüter Mathew Ryan and shot to the right side of the network.
"Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he got a door right now."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This door fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball at this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good style pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to control Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attacker shot the ball into the net just before he went out.
City plays in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhine-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim v. Hoppenheim.
Scherzer wants to destroy the rockies game
Since the Nationals are excluded from the Playoff competition, there was little reason to force another use.
However, the always powerful skier hopes to stand on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies on the hill, but only if this is relevant to the rockies that in the NL West have a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers, for the Playoffs.
The Rockies achieved at least one wild card with a 5:2 victory over the nations on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we can’t play at all, we can at least throw because we know the atmosphere in the viewers here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not participate in this competition?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but they are inclined to leave jokes in such a situation, according to reports.
Scherzer, for which this would be the 34th application as a starting player, practiced in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on Sunday at his normal rest day.
Washington's legal hands have this season a statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 inches.
Trump stops broadcasting in West Virginia
The president referred directly to the situation in connection with the Brett Kavanaugh, whom he elected for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones – I don't start, but actually I start, so I fight for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it now.
And they are determined to take power again with all their means, you see the community, the despicability.
It is no matter who they hurt, who they have to overcome, to gain power and control, that is what they want, power and control, we will not give them."
The Democrats, he said, look at their mission to "resistance and block".
"And you will see it in the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "suffering and bitter and disgusting and indiscriminate".
He called it the highest-ranking democracy in the Senate Justice Committee, Senator Diane Feinstein, which triggered rumors in the audience.
“Do you remember their answer?
Did you get the document outside?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, no, I'm waiting for you one – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer valid for all opinions.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party agreed to beat me, this came a little surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour Members to whom it is said that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly, since she had risen vigorously against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticised by the table application for a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, of ironically similar issues, of which Jeremy and former top politicians were not an opinion.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting said on Friday that "the meetings should be inclusive and productive".
Most of the Friday GC meetings in my eight years as local Labour Agent were exactly that.
Unfortunately, most meetings today are not marked by this tone, and the promised "friendlyr, more manageable" policy has been forgotten for a long time since it started at all.
It becomes increasingly clear that divergent views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion will then be judged whether they are accepted by the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a party leader. Colleagues, with whom I previously believed to share similar political views, now expected me to make a turnaround and adopt positions with which I would otherwise never have agreed – whether in terms of national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – while it doesn’t matter what I say – there’s a time in the social media that calls for me to pick up the political center and says that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are mostly political nature.
I admire the professionality and determination of my colleagues, who face daily a flood of sessistical or racist attacks and yet never get too small.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that seizures have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn requested last week that the Labour Party promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we no longer allow all opinions to be taken into account, and with each application of suspicion and any amendment of the rules of procedure, the party will be more closely involved.
In the last two years, I have often been asked to raise my head and not to express my opinion so clearly, and then I would be "no problem".
But I didn't go into politics.
Since 32 years ago as a student, I have suffered the neglect of the Thatcher government, because of which my classroom in the whole school has literally joined the Labour Party, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – as a community minister as well as as cabinet minister.
I've never made a hero out of my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be unclear about my political positions and about areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of the Friday application: In view of the fact that the country will be too hard on a brexit, the household, company and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I did not send this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that I will not be held back by so many threats or political intentions, in my opinion, to act best for all of you.

Ayr versus Melrose 38:17: Unbeatable Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr won the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tannent's Premiership.
They are now the only ten of the teams unbeatable at the top of the table.
Last but not least, the success of the home team was due to its overarching resistance as well as to its better exploitation of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far, and we are still unbeatable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Recognition for Ayr, they have made better use of their chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was raised by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, Melrose was able to speak the numbers for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, due to a yellow card, and Jason Baggot started a non-extensive attempt.
Climo built the leadership of Ayr with a penalty step before he achieved a hit directly at half time and then reached an increased attempt in the driveway, so it stood for Ayr's break 17:5.
Melrose, however, began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was raised by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Then there was a longer interruption due to a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, who was worn by the playing field. After the continuation, Ayr built up his advantage by an increased attempt by Stafford McDowall.
Then, as Captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again Melrose paid the additional man at the end of a huge phase of pressure by a non-extensive attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tattleling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson achieved from the criminal gas from a touchdown behind the emerging ayr package.
Climo has increased almost since the break, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong's capture of Boxkick and had sent Flanders Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the home team.
Still Game Star seems ready for new careers in gastronomy
“Still Game” Star Ford Kieran appears to be ready for a change in hospitality after it turned out to be the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC release, whose spinbook he writes, and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
Both have announced that the upcoming nine staff will be the last of the shipment, and Kiernan seems to plan a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the manager of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was interested in climbing into Glasgow's "floating restaurant business".
'The sea belongs to us': Bolivia, included by the country, hopes that a court will open the way for peace
Matrosen patrol the marine capital quarter in La Paz, decorated with Tauwerk.
In public buildings there is a more blue flag.
The motto is: “The sea is our legal property.
It is a duty to win back."
Everywhere in Bolivia, including the country, the memory of the 19th-century lost coastal section of Chile in a bloody conflict is as vivid as the desire to drive again over the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, since Bolivia is waiting for an International Court of Justice ruling to be held on 1 October following five years' consultations.
"Bolivia has the tendency, a spirit of unity and happiness and expects the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are following the judgment of the IGH on large screens, hoping that the court in The Hague will decide for Bolivia's demand. According to this, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea after decades of sporadic talks.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who won a controversial fight next year for his re-election, is also very much at stake on Monday's judgment.
"We are about to return to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the Court would decide in favour of Bolivia, and believe that this would also make little change.
The UN body established in the Netherlands is not authorized to speak to Chilean territory and has determined that it will not be decided on the outcome of possible discussions.
In the view of Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, that the case was “not complicated,” the IGH concluded six months after the conclusion.
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the last four years could also mean a setback.
"The current Bolivian government has broken down the issue of access to the sea," Zárate said.
She pointed out that morale's war rhetoric has stifled any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some time, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, reiterated the view that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia has “an extraordinary opportunity to introduce a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end the 139 years of disputes for each other’s benefit”, he said.
Calzadilla also argues that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – uses the topic of the sea as a political force.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is a chance to recognize that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament only takes place if it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be able to disarm their nuclear weapons first if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called upon the United States to implement commitments made during a summit between the Heads of State of the rivals in Singapore.
His statements come at a time when US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to have been in Singapore for more than three months after the summit with the North Korean state chief Kim Jong-un just ahead of time to bring the determined atom diplomacy back into progress.
Ri mentioned the idea that further sanctions and the resistance of the United States against a declaration to end the Korean war would ever force the North into the knee, as "Hirngespinst".
Washington is skeptical and does not want to accept the statement without Pjöngang taking major steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, it is widely known that Pjöngang is serious about giving up an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only chance of guaranteeing its security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pjöngang for next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris the latest collections for huge head coverings that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to extend your hat collection or completely clear the sun, you don't have to search any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a palette of crazy oversized head coverings for their 2019 summer collection, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical huts have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their spectacular creations over the trail.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extra-vaginating beige-coloured hat with a feathery wide edge that just pushed the heads of the models.
As other super-dimensional accessories with jewels, watermelons, a magic hat, and even a pineapple were displayed. However, these are not meant to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks were fitted with upholstered lips and had more similarity with Hannibal Lecter than with skin couture.
One creation resembled a diving equipment, including snorkel and a diving glasses, while another looked like a molten iron.
And if you want to put on another huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Fashion viewers predict that the huge head coverings could find their way in shopping streets near you.
The overdimensional huts follow directly the "La Bomba", the narrow hut with 60 centimeters wide edge, all carrying from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat, which hit large waves in the social media, sent another great creation over the track path: a beach bag made of straw, which was almost as big as the model wearing a bath suit that held the bag.
The bass bag in red orange with bass francs and a white leather hook was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' Summer 2019 collection "La Riviera" at the Paris Fashion Week.
Prominent stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect large cabins and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets for the next summer. The designer has taken so much into account that the demand for over-dimensional accessories will not be ignored.”
John Edward: Language skills for world citizens essential
Scotland's independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence. In 2018, this continued with outstanding results and is supported only by individual and joint success in the fields of sport, art, music and other Community enterprises.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) aim to provide their students and their parents with the highest possible level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that is able to design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you will reach his head.
If you speak with him in your own language, you will reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current results of this year's exam show that languages with the highest existing rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages achieved Note A in the higher examinations.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin achieved Note A in higher studies, while 72 percent of students who learned German, 69 percent of students who learned French, and 63 percent of students who learned Spanish also achieved Note A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages today are considered to be election subjects as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and other places.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons why employers called for problems in the occupation of open jobs were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly required when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more open-ended languages are available, these knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future because of such lifelong ability.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multilingual people will automatically provide an advantage to competitors.
According to a survey by more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent did not speak a foreign language well enough to lead an entertainment, and French was spoken as the only language by a double percentage (15 percent).
That is why it is important for children today that we invest in language learning.
Children who speak several languages, especially languages from developing countries, will have better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the classic modern languages, while other languages will be taught, which are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever the interests of your child lie, independent schools will always have a number of languages with appropriately specialized teachers to choose.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills needed for their success, as always the future looks.
At this point in a global economic environment, languages cannot be said to be of primary importance for the future of the country. Therefore, this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should in fact be regarded as 'international communication capacity'.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this opportunity of choice, diversity and excellence.
It needs to be done well.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent School.
LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James arrive for the first time for Los Angeles Lakers, waiting will soon end.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes will he play, however, is not yet fixed.
“There will be more than one and less than 48” said Walton on the official laker website.
The Laker's reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play only a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week, after training, James was asked about his plans for the six games of the lakers.
"I don't need pre-season games in this phase of my career," he said.
Weather Forecast in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of election campaigns.
This is the first of Trump's five broadcasts planned for the next week, including well-known places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the floating vote on the confirmation of his election for the holiday at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections in November, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the congress.
When does Trump's announcement take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you view it online?
Trump's announcement in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 a.m. (East coast time).
You can track Trump's news in West Virginia below as livestream on YouTube online.
Trump will probably address the hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, on charges of sexual misconduct carried out this week in a tense atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation remains up to one week in the sweat, while the FBI is conducting investigations.
However, the main objective of this series is to support Republicans who have to make difficult choices in November.
Therefore, President Trump's election team told Reuters that these five broadcasts would serve in the coming week to "mobilize volunteers and supporters while the Republicans try to keep their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives".
"The control of the Congress is so important for its plans that the President will travel in as many states as possible, while the operational election season is nearing," said a Trump-Voice speaker, who did not want to name his name, to Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania could participate in the Wesbanco Arena broadcast planned for the evening in Wheeling, and report to the media from Pittsburgh.
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month in West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to support the Republican Senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who are in charge.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him up in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team shows readiness to maintain hope for the individual on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four parties may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed on Saturday afternoon.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a pure invention, but one that the players really believe, especially in competitions like these.
So where is the moment of her opinion now?
"They were in charge with six points, and now there are four, so I think that this means a small moment for us," Jordan Spieth said when leaving the playground.
Europe is, of course, in favour and is ahead of four points, while twelve more follow-up.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can present three of four points each.
Spieth was extremely strong from the end to the green and went ahead with a good example.
In the course of his round, the goutary moods became louder than he lowered an important pott to decide the fourth match with four points for both after he and Thomas retired after two holes with two points.
His Putt, who decided the match on the 15th hole for them, triggered a similar step that leads to the conclusion that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"I really need to clean up and take care of my own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of individual players.
18 liars to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the only player in the last two days, have achieved more points than Spieth and Thomas and thus undoubtedly wrote the story of Ryder Cup.
Europe's unequal but sympathetic duo is at four of four points and cannot do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only couple who didn't beat a Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and on the back nine holes on Friday morning Bogeys.
This series and the apparently flowing energy between them and the released amount undermines that they are the players that it applies to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to win a possible European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
Speaking of European fame, however, it would be early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia, the fourth hero of the morning, who played along with Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spaniard and the Swedes into a glue that they could not overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the mud.
The four and four pairs are due to the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or do not give, and the way in which a strategy can change quickly, so fascinatingly from the near.
The Europeans have so far played better as a team and are in the lead on the last day. However, this round has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the US, have hesitated.
Europe is leading on the last day of Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is in front of the four and four parties from Saturday to the United States at 10:6 and is taking a solid lead in the last day of Ryder Cup.
The brilliantly playing Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the tiger Woods struggling with difficulties and thus managed to book four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjørn, who wanted to win back the Trophies lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the four of us in the morning against the American team that was playing the wrong game and won the 3-1 series.
In the four parties, the United States won more resistance and won two matches, but the balance could not be lifted.
Jim Fury's team needed eight points in the twelve items played on Sunday to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood won four points as the first European newling, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend of Molliwood, won only four points as the second duo in Ryder Cup's history in their four opening match.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized perfectly and beat the unspoiled Woods and the American Newling Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who had slipped through two matches on Saturday, occasionally let his brilliance shine, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in succession.
Justin Rose, who had retired in the morning during the four days, returned and played the four parties as partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2+1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant day of winds in the south-west of Paris, not everything was according to their ideas.
The three-time Major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the measuring slot for the Americans on Saturday.
In the fours, they won a 2&1 victory over the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter who played for Spain and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3 fourths after they lost the first two holes.
In the history of Ryder Cup it has only occurred twice that a team came back after it had gone into isolation with a remainder of four points. However, as a holder of title for Fury's team, a decision is needed to keep the trophies.
After they've only been in second place for two days, it doesn't look like they could start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral equipment without confidence
North Korea Foreign Minister said on Saturday in front of the United Nations that continued sanctions would deepen their suspicion of the United States and that under these circumstances the country would never give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea had taken "essential measures of good will" last year. For example, it has stopped nuclear and rocket tests to decompose nuclear testing sites and undertakes not to increase nuclear weapons and technologies.
"But we don't see any corresponding reactions from the USA," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will never be alone first."
While Ri reiterated North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-wise" procedure in the case of denouncing, which would be rewarded for successful steps, his statement seemed significant when she did not reject unilateral denounization from the past, as Pjöngang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an ambitious US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June. In this he had assured Kim to work on the "Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean war between 1950 and 1953, while the United States has said that Pjöngang must first cease its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes claims after the closure of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States is on "first denuclearization" and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and are even opposed to the "declaration of the end of war," Ri said.
“The assumption that we can impose sanctions on our knees is a brainstorm of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions will deepen our suspicions."
Ri did not go into plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. state chief had highlighted at the beginning of the week at the United Nations.
Instead, at three meetings between Kim and South Korean state chief Moon Jae-in over the past five months, the Minister said: "If South Korea were the other party in the question of denuclearization, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to this state."
However, the tone of Ris spoke was enormously different from his last year, when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea rockets on the mainland of the United States after "the evil president" Trump Kim had referred to himself as "Raketenmann" as a suicide mission.
This year Trump, who had threatened North Korea’s “full destruction” last year, overcame Kim with praise to the United Nations for his courage in terms of disarmament. He said that there was still much work to be done and that the sanctions should remain in force until North Korea’s denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pjöngang for the steps taken.
But on Thursday, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must in any case be pursued vigorously until we have achieved the complete, final and verified denuclearisation."
The Security Council has consistently reinforced the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to finance the withdrawal of Pjöngang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the side of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjöngang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, when he left Pjöngang, he said that progress was made to be charged only for hours later by North Korea, he had made “pass-like demands”.
North Korea promised to decommission this month at a meeting with Moon, a missile base and an atomic complex when the United States took 'appropriate measures'.
He said that Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" were security guarantees given by the Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep during this year's elementary school. This is a measure against the growing macho culture to stay awake with caffeine and learn over the whole night.
One scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to paying attention.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is his opinion according to the first such course in the USA.
He was inspired to call the course into life after having given a lecture on the effects of sleeplessness on learning.
“At last, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why do I experience it only now, in my last year?’
After her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. I was surprised," he said about The Telegraph.
This year's course for the first time explained to the students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance and also improve the general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after she had found that students were left under heavy sleepiness during the week.
The one hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section, the students see the picture of a room in a living room and click on coffee tables, curtains, training shoes and books. They receive information on the effect of caffeine and light as well as on the effects of sleep deprivation on the sports performance and the importance of a sleepout.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleepiness may increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and cancer.
Then they are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine by means of a map of the university site with interactive symbols.
“We know that the behaviour of students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of moving a “night shift” was still widespread, he said and added that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students made the lack of sleep a growing problem.
He said that to ensure good sleep, the "treasure weapon" of all students should be against stress, exhaustion and fear. Furthermore, a weight gain could be avoided, as sleepy sleep would shift the brain into the hunger mode, so that they would be hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course. He had a course in Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to press on a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study programme before they take up their studies at the competition-oriented university.
At the recommendation of Professor Czeisler, students should be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that comes from electronic screens and LED lights and can bring the ciircadian rhythm out of the touch. This leads to problems in sleeping.
Livingston Against Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor against Gerards Players
The Rangers lost another outside game when the hit by Dolly Menga for Steven Gerard's disagreeing team meant a 0:1 downside at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to book their first outdoor win since the 4:1-triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holts team added Gerard to the first defeat in 18 games as manager, so his team left eight points behind in the Ladbrokes Premiership with remote heart.
Menga met seven minutes before half-time, and the inspired rangers seemed to have no chance of compensation.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingstone rises to the third place and is only behind hibernian at the Tordifference.
The Rangers also threatens further trouble after having had to be treated by a apparent object thrown out of the guest block because of a headgear.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that took over Ayr and reached the half-final of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, he remained with the same eleven Livingstone players who cut hearts in the last week, and must have been thrilled to see how his well-trained team kept their opponents on step and step by step.
The Rangers dominated the ball possession, but Livingstone achieved more when they had the ball.
They were supposed to get a door after only two minutes when Menga's first delivery to Allan McGregor's door led Scott Pittman. However, the middle-field player missed his chance and shot him.
Then a long release from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his opponent Alan Lithgow was only able to pass through the back post.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third, their game seemed more hopeful than convinced.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously the view that after a quarter hour, he should have received a penalty for a conflict between him and Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not apply the Colombian complaints.
The Rangers arrived in the first half of the year, but the former Ibrox Torhüter Liam Kelly had little difficulty with Lassana Coulibalys headball and a shot taken by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston hits in the 34th minute may not correspond to the game run, it is not to be lied that they had earned him alone for their hard work.
Again, the rangers could not deal with a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball at Scott Robinson, who held the peace and searched Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerard acted for half-time and replaced Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change showed almost immediately effect when the player brought Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block the ball.
However, Livingstone continued to bring the guests to play exactly the game that was theirs, with Lithgov and Halkett getting a long ball after the other.
Holt's team could have expanded their leadership in the last phase, but McGregor stood well and refused Jacobs before Lithgow left the corner.
The Rangers exchanger Glenn Middleton also asked for a sentence after a match with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
German: The Founder of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning German: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as Geiger numerator.
Since then, the geigercounter has become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the apparently unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in all the world is this?"
Rogers: “It’s a geiger numerator used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
If you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Indeed, I hear a knock!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention that bears his name, however, lives on.
New cancer vaccine can contribute to the immune system, "see" decomposed cells.
A new cancer vaccine can contribute to the immune system, to “see” and destroy detoxified cells.
The vaccine contributes to the detection of decomposed cells in the treatment of the immune system.
In the method, a patient will receive immune cells that will be modified in the laboratory.
These cells can "see" a lot of common protein and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancers.
The egg cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that causes the immune system to detect decomposed cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method allows a patient to remove immune cells that are modified in the laboratory so that they can see the many types of cancer common protein HER2. Afterwards, the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "supports the growth of various types of cancers", including breast, eggstock, lung and intestine cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method used to treat immune cells and to treat cancer cells has been helpful in treating leukaemia.
Kanye West released a pro-Trump triade after his appearance at SNL and carried a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It wasn't good.
Kanye West was promoted to Saturday Night Live in the studio after he widely praised and said he wanted to join the presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", and wearing a Make-American Great Again hat, he continued with a cannon against the Democrats and again stressed his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by white people, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.”
So if I were to worry about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the broadcast with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywoodstar made a joke about Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's Justice Committee on the charges raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of the West Shipyard has not been sent, it was uploaded by the comicist Chris Rock in social media.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of the publication about West.
West also complained to the audience that he had difficulties behind the stage because of his head covering.
“They fooled me behind the stage.
They said, “Don’t go out with the hat”.
You fucked me up!
And then they say I was in a narrow area," he said to Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the dark area?" He said he would "draw my supermancape, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do. Do you want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love."
His comments were at least twice released from the audience, and SNL-Actives were painfully affected, reported Variety. One person said in the magazine: “It was still in the studio.”
West was later obliged to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a talk entitled "I Love It", where he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA. She tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: DANKE, YOU'RE THE MASS DESTRUCTED HOST."
However, the talk show moderator Karen Hunter tweeted, the West was just himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I would like someone who, in my opinion, makes himself too harmful to my community and gives himself no reward (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his “art”).
He's free.
The same applies to us." she added.
Before the broadcast, the Rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The beings officially known as Kanye West).
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg brought the name Snoop Lion, and of course changed Prince, the deceased musician, his name in a symbol and then in "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince".

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword of swinging Jon Snow in HBOs of violent medieval fantasy "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the stereotype of the macho hero. He said that such roles on the screen would have resulted in boys having the feeling often having to be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Harington said he believed that something had gone wrong, and asked how to solve the problem of toxic humanity in the #MeToo season.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, also 31 who was also involved in the Game of Thrones, added that the solution to the problem was “very important”.
"I personally find the question very important, what has been wrong with humanity," he said.
"What have we added to the problem that we are now looking at?"
Harington believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the very masculinity.
He continued: “What is born again, and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the street that the boy feels to have to body this particular side of a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change this?
"For the young men have gone to prison."
He also stated in the interview that after the end of the series next summer he will not participate in prequels or sequels by "Game of Thrones". He has "enough of battlefields and horses".
From November on, Harington is in a new edition of Sam Shepard's "True West" to see the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently said that for him the best was "Game of Thrones" that he had known his wife Rose.
"I have met my wife on this mission, so I have received my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie played in the fantastic Ygritte series, with numerous Emmys, the beloved of Harington's character Jon Snow.
In June 2018, they married Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast to the past, transmission took place in the vast majority of the new cases by sex.
So far, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected in this way with HIV was almost zero, Chinese health officials reported at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, in China, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in 1997 in China, however, the discrimination of members of the LGBT community should be widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of disease are due to insufficient protection in the transport of sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees have allowed the data of the GOP senators to be secure, criticizing "hazardous lies" and "sworn theories"
Maxine Waters, member of the U.S. House of Representatives, opposed on Saturday claims, a member of her staff published the personal information of three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia pages of the MPs.
The Los Angeles Democrat believes that the claims of "ultra-right" experts and websites would be disseminated.
"Lifes, lies, and even more hideous lies," Waters said on Twitter in a statement.
The published information is intended to include the private addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. During the hearing of a Senate committee on the charges raised against the Supreme Court candidates Brett Kavanaugh for sexual misconduct by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the contributions was assigned to Waters’ office and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, reported The Hill.
"This unwarranted charge is absolutely wrong and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these misleading and false accusations, was in no way responsible for ensuring this information.
This unfounded accusation is absolutely wrong and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly triggered criticism, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former press speaker of the White House.
"This Dementi is angry," Fleischer wrote.
“This leads to the conclusion that she does not have the right temper to be a member of the Congress.
People who are accused of something they have not done should not be angry.
You mustn't be stubborn.
You must not question the defendant's motives.
You must be calm and let go."
Flesher Waters’ reaction to the criticism of the Democrats seemed to compare to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics, while hearing on Thursday was too angry.
Omar Navarro, also a Republican candidate who enters the mid-term elections to resolve water, expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if that's true," he tweeted.
Waters stated in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and prosecution authorities of these misleading allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed," she continued, "and that they will be taken into account for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my staff members".
Criticism about "Johnny English – You only live three times" – weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in any UK-coloured new film. This also seems to apply to this recovery of the action comedy parody "Johnny English", which began in 2003 with "Johnny English – The Spion, which started it" and in 2011 with "Johnny English – Now just right" again.
Will an ironic self-paradise on the subject, as we are obviously accustomed, to the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glamorous, grimassen cutting and incompetent Johnny English was extended for the second time. His name signaled more than anything else that he was a general comical creation for cinema visitors in the non-English area.
Of course, he is once again the busy secret agent who is curiously cool and world-class, while in reality he is from something Clouseau, a prize Mr. Bean and a cuckoo of this bursary, who has contributed to the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games in London a single note to the title song of "The Hour of the Winner".
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos behind retired travelers and international secret agents, who played Atkinson in the currently forgotten Barclaycard TV stores.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I felt as Johnny English approached a helicopter in a middle-aged weapon and the rotor leaves were close to his helmet.
Atkinson's experience for physical comics is increasing, but the humor seems rather weak and rare, especially because the "serious" films such as "007" and "Mission Nexus" are currently offering self-evident comedian elements.
The humour seems to be more like children than adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy misconceptions are not as impressive and focused as Atkinson's stupid filmgags in the role of the bean.
The eternal current prize is now that Britain is in great danger.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and has revealed the identities of all British agents in use, very to the detriment of the serving agent, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, a blushed and stressed figure that is already facing the complete collapse because of her political impatience: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi-Teresa-May character, but the script doesn't give her much to work with.
Their Secret Service Advisers inform them that all active spies have been expelled and therefore have to get someone out of rest.
This is also part of Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a sending institution, but there is informal teaching at work as a undercover agent. There are a few gags in it, because English offers a spy academy that reminds of "School of Rock".
English will be brought back to Whitehall for an emergency hearing and reunited with his former hard-tested Kumpan Bow, which is played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a U-boat commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin, who always make everything awfully wrong in the service of your Majesty, are back in action. They meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullettova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously in the ranks of a charismatic tech billionaire, the window of Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain.
English and Bough start their odyssey of grotesque sparrows: As a Kellner dressed they put a cool French restaurant in fire, they make sure of chaos when they smuggle on board Voltas luxury yacht, and English dissolves pure anarchy when he tries to make himself familiar with the interior of Voltas House with a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, although all the registers are drawn, but so sympathetic and funny she is also, the topic is already dealt with in detail in children's television.
Pretty moderate substance.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, ‘Can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not play a role that is really being played by his talent?’
Labour disputes to work on a plan after which the British work four days a week but are to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is planning to consider a radical plan that provides that the British work four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
The party wishes to report that the company leaders will pass on the savings achieved by the KI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional free day to the workers.
In order for employees to have a three-day weekend, they would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea of the Party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country to the benefit of the workers is "appropriate".
Conversion to a four-day week was promoted by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A high - ranking source from the Labour Party said regarding the Sunday Times: “A review of the directive is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
"A change will not take place overnight, but a work week of four days is an effort that is consistent with the party's approach to restoring economic balance for workers and with the party's general industrial policy strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to favour such an idea. The Green Party has already promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the approach is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: "In a four-day week it is not a party policy and it is not taken into account by the party."
The shadow Chancellor John McDonnell made his presentation of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "profitmakers" in public supply companies.
The plans of the shadow officer also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not retain their full share, as a labor government could take 'abduction' due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the relevant plans to recruit employees in the offices of companies and set up inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who cancel annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy express themselves in the news magazine '60 minutes', whether the FBI's investigation in the case of Kavanaugh might change its opinion.
The FBI's investigation into the proposals against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has a final vote on his appointment as Judge of the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the results of the Authority could influence Republican senators in order to win their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring some days, which could eventually change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I announced in the debate that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him later, this claim was made, and asked if he had done it.
He was determined, determined and unmistakable."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be sealed in stone.
“My opinion is that Brett Kavanaugh is concerned, and it had to be a bomb,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has fought this hard," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she called could not confirm it."
It's 36 years.
And I can't make any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and was contributed to reducing poverty within this festival?
On this Saturday in New York, the Global Citizen Festival takes place to fight poverty in the world with an impressive lineup to stars and an equally impressive mission.
Ten thousand will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place this year on 7th time, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness of the real goal of the event: the fight against extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international interest group is trying to combat poverty by motivating more and more people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to complete a number of tasks. These include actions such as voluntary work, communication with a leading policyer worldwide (by email or phone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal – the fight against poverty –.
How successful is the project when you consider that Global Citizens remain 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is it the idea to look at a cool free concert, a meaningful opportunity to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called cliquetivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global citizens reported that the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions from its supporters since 2011.
These actions are intended to contribute to attracting leading politicians from around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from their actions, of which at least 10 billion US dollars have already been paid or purchased by fundraising.
According to the group's estimates, the funds secured so far have a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments are the The Power of Nutrition project, a partnership of investors and implementers with headquarters in the United Kingdom, who have committed themselves to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with 35 million US dollars to combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history," the ambassadors of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, following more than 5,000 actions with which the UK was invited to improve the food situation of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the The Power of Nutrition project, which should reach 5 million women and children and provide food interventions.
As an answer to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question of why global citizens can fight extreme poverty,
They replied: “There will be a long and challenging path with heights and depths.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will have success, as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists who took part in this year's New York event, including Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
The US could use the Navy for blockage purposes to prevent Russian energy exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to Washington Examine, Washington can return to the Navy if necessary, so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets, including the Middle East, the US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke told us.
Zinke claimed that the use of Russia in Syria is a pretext for exploring new energy markets. Russia is currently active at the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
"I think that the real reason for Russia's use in the Middle East is to negotiate new energy markets, just like in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to do this.
"The United States can ensure, together with the Navy, that the seaways remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that understood itself as "the voice of electricity consumers" in the United States.
He drew a comparison between Washington's practices in dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they were practically identical.
"The use and substitution of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, while he described Russia as "One Trick Pony" with a fossil-dependent economy.
The statements were made when the government was under Trump to expand exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and thus replace Russia with the far cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unmeasured" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump Berlin, became Moscow's "contained".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline is worth 11 billion US dollars, which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, to be an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we are all of the opinion that energy should not be used as a means to exert pressure, and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US received a counterwind from Germany that confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has called on the United States to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," says the board of the BDI Dieter Fight after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "check out a presidential candidate for 2020," says the Senator for Massachusetts
The Senate of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that it would "examine closely" a presidential candidacy after the mid-elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to examine a presidential candidacy after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump was leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy," she said.
In her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, Warren, a candidate for the Supreme Court, did not take a sheet in front of his mouth.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that a FBI investigation is of course necessary before the vote.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of the Warren electorate does not believe that they should be candidates for 2020.
According to the survey of the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts indicated that the senator should not run.
32% of voters supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of the former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent who favour a potential candidacy, and 48 percent who are against it.
Among the other names of prominent Democrats, who are in favour of a potential candidate for 2020, are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press Biden, he would officially decide until January.
Sarah Palin expresses herself on the Donald Trump-Rally for post-traumatic stress disorder, suffering under the track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son can do, what he can do, when he comes back, can sense anything other families that feel the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds that our soldiers will return with,” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as an elephant in the space and said about her son and other war veterans that she had changed her return, that she had returned to the country, and wondered if there was any respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military had given to the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused a woman of domestic violence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Office.
18 Federal States and D.C. support legal aid to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal aid to the new US policy that rejects victims of gang activity or domestic violence.
The representatives of the 18 federal states and the district make an expert statement on Friday in Washington to support an asylum-seeker who is in charge of politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace-against-session complaint submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy was not announced.
She reported that her partner "and his violent bandits" abused them, but US officials refused their asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors, who support Grace, called El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States as nations that have great problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy raised a decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals of 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants to apply for asylum before domestic violence.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "refused to ignore the legislation at state, federal and international level".
“The Federal Act stipulates that all asylum applications are assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application and that this court is in breach of this principle” was stated in the Court’s statement.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policy that immigrants refuse access to the country had an adverse impact on the US economy, as immigrants could be more active than entrepreneurs and could provide the necessary workforce.
Advocate General Jeff Sessions arranged in June that victims of domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs should no longer be granted asylum.
"Asyl is there for all those who leave their home country because they are persecuted or afraid because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political conviction," the sessions said in his announcement of the policy of 11 June.
It was never the plan to remove all problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems people have to struggle with every day around the world.
Succeeded rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of victims in the race doubles with time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It's all very tense," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma and calms her little fat son in a rescue center in the destroyed town of Palu.
“Every minute a new car comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
The inhabitants returned to their ruined houses to collect their riches and wealth and to mount everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the employees of the hospitals, who were damaged by the earthquake with the force of 7.5, were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who raised vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of persistent severe complications.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the strong earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and his daughter.
“All went too fast.
I think I was trapped under the fallen walls," he reported to the Associated Press, adding that the reason for the stay in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
US ambassadors complain to China of the tyranny with "propaganda ads"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper triggered a quadrilateral announcement in an American daily newspaper announcing the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, US ambassadors in China accused the state capital Beijing of using the American press for propaganda purposes.
Last Wednesday, USA Donald Trump referred to China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most sold magazine in Iowa, after he had accused China of joining the US Congress elections on November 6, an accusation that China disputes.
Trump's allegations that Beijing has tried to intervene in the US waves are in line with the U.S. announcement to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign, triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to turn on advertisements for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an extensive trade war, with customs duties on imports for both countries.
The Chinese payrolls at the start of the trade war should meet exporters in countries like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, who exports large-scale agricultural products to China, reported that Beijing workers, owners of agricultural holdings and companies were damaged.
China, so Branstad, in an opinion in Des Moines Register on Sunday, now doubles this tyranny by switching propaganda ads into its own free press in the United States.
"With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government advocates the tradition of free expression and independent press, which has been proven in America, by turning the country on advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, you will find only a limited number of votes on the paper sketches here in Beijing and do not find a real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese might have on China's disturbing economic development, given the fact that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article. However, he did not call the name of the newspaper.
Republicans sell voters before the interim elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, alert observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, given several allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned against a counter-reaction during the forthcoming elections, which could come from women in particular.
The vote in this connection was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already indicated that they continue to vote.
"Such things can't be done back," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last minute's priority of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) was sufficient for an FBI investigation to detect angry voters.
"Don't forget what was yesterday, they won't forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said on Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn, as the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators in the Senate's "November is coming!" called, when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to hold the nomination of Kavanaughs and reported that despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, Mic.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation were an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political observer of the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not choose."
Even before the Ford's public statement, in which its allegations of sexual assault against the candidates of the Supreme Court are detailed, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could be the result if the Republicans submitted the confirmation.
"This situation is a backdrop for the GOP," said at the beginning of last week Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, NBC News.
"It is not only the vote of the committee, the final vote or the review of Kavanaughs; it is also the way the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group supporting the election of Democrats, told the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be unconcerned about who they should believe because of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with a slightly larger share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced by Ford's statement, while 35% indicated that they were definitely or probably giving Kavanaugh beliefs.
In addition, 38% indicated that they were of the opinion that Kavanaugh had probably lied or definitively to his statement, while 30% indicated the same about Ford.
Following the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported, The Guardian.
Ford made a statement last week before the Senate Justice Committee that she was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had disbanded her genitals when she was at a party during her study in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to confront Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a market with the aim of establishing a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information they receive.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the intention behind inrupt was the "welthership".
"We need to be active now," he said on the topic of startup.
"It is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so that users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library as well as other tools for the private and business area.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in a browser and at the same time.
The particular thing about the personal online data storage is that the user can decide by himself who can access the data.
The company refers to this concept as personal strengthening and development of data.
According to CEO of John Bruce, the idea behind inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and corresponding capabilities so that solid is available for all.
Currently, companies include Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been set up to work on this project, as well as a community volunteer programmer. Furthermore, a security platform acquired by IBM is used.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers can create their own decentralised apps worldwide with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee announced that he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google about whether a comprehensive change should be made in which their entire business model is completely redesigned overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a contribution to the media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy production and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee provided a redesign of the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee was heavily involved in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the start of Inrupt, Berners Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, bearer of the Victorian Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England, who was distinguished as a fighter with the Victorian crusade during the 1st World War, was honored in his home city 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Vann won the award due to his use in the attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sharpsman and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
On Sunday, two of his grandchildren were exposed to a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, a memorial stone.
One of the uncles, Michael Vann, thought that this act was full of symbolism, since the monument was revealed exactly 100 years after the hero's date for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918; through dense fog and under heavy fire of cannons and machine guns.
Later, he rushed to the fire line and led the line forward with the "greatest daring" before he had a single-armed field weapon and turned off three of the military units.
Colonel Vann was shot on October 4, 1918 by a German sharpsman; something more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the deeds of his grandfather were something he could never be justified, and at the same time something that would make a humble one.
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he placed a cross under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band after the parade.
Michael Vann pointed out that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, and added that the maturity of a real hero would become visible mainly by supporting many people.
MMA fans have stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you've been awake all night to watch an exciting bellator 206 and then you can't watch the main event.
The calculation of San Jose included 13 fights, including 6 on the main card, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as the Ggard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared themselves for their fight, the viewers in the United Kingdom did not complain bad when Pappa Pig was suddenly seen.
Some remained unaffected after being awake until early in the morning to see the fight in particular.
A fan on Twitter described the change to the trick film figure as some kind of bad joke.
"Because of a government regulation, these contents are classified as not being youth-free, so that they had to be changed to a child's shipment at 6 p.m.," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in the field of marketing and communication with Bellator, when he was asked about the transfer.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The company board at Bellator, Scott Coker, announced that the company will be working on the expiry plan to take into account visitors from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think the problem could have been solved by the game," he said.
"But it's 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday with the visitors in the United Kingdom, and we won't solve the event until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stay inside.
It was very much communicated with each other and it wasn't always nice.
We have tried to solve the problem, and we have come to the conclusion that it is a technical disorder.
What wasn't the case was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will reduce the whole to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual, and we have tried to offer the fans the best possible experience.
The whole situation is rather regrettable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "delay" on the topic of sexuality
Tom Daley, who took part in various Olympic games, says that he grew up with the feeling of being subjected to everyone else because of his sexuality. But this feeling had motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old felt that he had only realized at the secondary school that he was different from others.
In the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken on the subject of shoulen rights to encourage others.
He also meant that since he became a father, victory in the Olympic games is no longer so important to him.
The real moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses illness for a few months.
In the first shipment of Laverne, he said that he formerly viewed himself as inferior in comparison to others, since the love of boys and girls was socially unacceptable.
He said: "To this day, it is the feeling of being subordinate and different from others, the reason for my power and strength and finally for my success."
He wanted to prove that he was a very special person, not to disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The double bronze medal winner at the Olympics is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he had expressed himself on this subject because he could happily live without restrictions and without discrimination and would like to do other courage.
The three-time world champion fell in love with the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married Oscar's 20-year-old winner in the previous year, but he said that the age difference had never been a topic.
He thinks that if you had to spend so much as a child and young people – he took part 14 for the first time in the Olympics and his father died three years later in cancer, it is hard to find someone at the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple have had a son who bears the name Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley thinks that his whole view has changed since then.
Even in the last year, he had everything turned around like gold medals.
But for him there are now more important than Olympia gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He bears the same names as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the imminent death, and one of the last things he asked about was the tickets for London in 2012, as he wanted to be there before.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that it was finally clear to me that he was not invincible," he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
"I only knew that it was always my dream to dive in the Olympics before the home audience – that was crazy," he said.
His first selection of songs – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by them. He heard the song in front of the Olympics and still cared for the whole skin.
Desert Island Discs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, currently not in shape, sits at Ryder Cup on Saturday at the replacement bank
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to work very hard not to make the whole thing into a debacle.
Mickelson, who played at the 12th time event, was sent to the replacement bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the story, the five-fold Majors spent his day in fire and work on his game, hoping to solve the problems he was facing.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mikkelson was never the directest golfer and thus no ideal crew for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misdirected balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself wasn't encouraging enough, Mickelson meets on Sunday in the ninth game on the perfectist British Open-Champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood, Neuling at these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points left a hot start in the 12 individual games, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely decisive.
Fury expressed confidence in Mickelson and could not add much.
"He was completely about his role today in the clear, gave me a stick on my back and put his arm around me and thought he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has quite a lot of confidence in himself.
He is one of the world's best-known personalities and has done so much for these teams in the past and also this week.
I didn't think he was in two games.
I had imagined more, but that's how it's been and that's what we've been expecting.
He wants to be like everyone else."
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup race that never entirely matches the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson can record 18 wins, had to score 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Fury announced that his presence had already enriched the team alone.
"He's funny and sarcastic, original and he likes to make a few lates, and he's a great man who's popular with the whole team," he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little closer this week. It was fun to watch them.
He's a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that with the advantage it can be over soon
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage that leads to the last individual games in Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seven Ballesteros had a lead of five points against the Americans, but only came a little over the target line and led with the slightest lead and won a victory of 141⁄2–131⁄2.
“The idea remains that we had a great advantage in Valderrama, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we have won, but only recently,” said Bjørn (recorded on the photo), after seeing the victory 5–3 of the class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it's not over.
It's gonna be okay tomorrow.
Get in the suit and do exactly the right thing.
The whole is only over when the points are on the display table.
We have a goal, we want to win this trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I've always said that I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're completely clear about what's going on on the other side: the best players in the world."
Asked about the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never break it.
Tomorrow's gonna be another caliber.
The individual services are in the foreground tomorrow, and that's a completely different thing.
It's great to work with a partner when things go well, but if you're alone out there, then you'll be tested to the limits of his abilities as a golfer.
You have to make this clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you let your partner behind you and he also has to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will note that his players individually cut off better than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of that big turn on the last day of the tournament. He stood in Brooklyn on the winning side before he stood on the sides of the losers after Europe's "Wonder of Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the fast start you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the moment hits a direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out as we feel, you know, we're trying to fertilize tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of taking the lead in the match, he has to take part in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the upper half of the ranking.
"I have decided for the boys in this order, because I believe it covers everything," Bjorn said about his selection for the individual meetings.
Germany's new warship again delayed
The newest frigates of the German Navy were to be put into service in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War that came in the years. However, local media say it will only be delivered on the basis of faulty systems and fast-growing costs in the early years.
The launch of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the lead ship of the brand new frigates of the ‘Baden-Württemberg’ class, was now moved to the first half of 2019, according to the time it took on a military speaker.
The ship was supposed to be put into service in 2014, but the ambitious project of worrying problems was planned after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
They are intended to include a capable cannon, a number of flight rockets and sea target bodies as well as tar technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflexion.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the continued delays can lead to the old-fashioned warships, which Germany is supposed to represent as a seafarer, will already be obsolete at the time of its launch, as the time has come.
The F125 F125 Fregate went to the battle lines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned to Hamburg by the Werft Blohm & Voss.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship after its delivery to the shipyard.
There was little information about the reasons for the return, but German media called a number of significant "software and hardware errors", which made the new ship useless in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious as vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by an occupation of only 120 matrixes, only about half as many as on the older frgatets of the Bremen class.
It has also been known that the ship is too difficult, which leads to performance losses and prevents the marine from carrying out in the future corrective measures.
The 7000 tons of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class that Germany used in World War II.
In addition to the wrong hardware, the costs of the whole project, including the training costs of the occupation, were also a problem.
It seems that the cost rose to a stunning €3.1 billion, compared to the originally planned €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly important in view of the latest warnings that the Seamacht will collapse Germany.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, German Federal Defence Officer, confirmed that the Navy "is going out of the capable ships".
Bartels said that the problem with time was increased, since old ships were taken apart from service, but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the Frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be removed from the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of the bat
In an estate in the Scottish Highlands, new research works are being carried out to show how bats use the landscape in the search for food.
It is hoped that the results will allow further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to lead future nature conservation activities.
The study carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will investigate the wiring and milling mills as well as the Brown Langohr and water mills in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the plot to record the activities of the bat during the whole season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also carry out mobile tests with portable detectors.
In an analysis of the noise of all recordings by experts, the frequency of the fluebermouse calls is determined and determined which species does what.
Then a map and a report of the living room will be created to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, Nature Protection Adviser for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are the most important and how they are used by each species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of measures to manage the living space, such as the creation of meadows, and to show how forest areas can be obtained for bats and other related species.
The Flemish stocks in Scotland and the entire United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect sleeping places and lead to the loss of the living space.
Windscreens and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly-carriers and the chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Fledermouse is not really blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a failed escort to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland, takes the theme of the floodhouse very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who carry out regular investigations, sleep-place inspections and sometimes rescue measures.
The organisation has even set up the first and only Fledermouse reserve in the Thrave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 Fledermouse species.
Good Manager David Thompson explains that the possession of the ideal living space is for her.
"Here in Tryave we have a great area for bats," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent living space.
But there are many things that we do not yet know about bats, so we do these work here and in other goods that will help us to learn more about what bats need to feel well."
He stresses how important it is to exclude the presence of bats before maintenance in the goods, as it is possible that the accidental destruction of a single nesting site would kill up to 400 females and young animals and destroy the entire population on site.
Fledermuse is protected and it is illegal to kill them, harm them or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish Preservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: “We still need to learn a lot about bats and in many of our species we don’t know how their populations are.”
Ronaldo argues about rape, while his lawyers want to complain about the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo described the alleged rape of him as "Fake News" and said that people want to "be famous" by using his name.
His lawyers plan to appeal to the news magazine The mirror that published the charges.
The storm of the National Team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $375.000 to buy her silence on the occasion, as Der Spiegel said on Friday.
In an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports only hours after their release as "Fake News."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News," said the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or to the camera.
“They want to be profiled by the use of my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," the player added smiling.
Ronaldos lawyers are prepared to make a claim to the mirror on the basis of the allegations they have referred to as "inadmissible report on privacy suspicions", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player demanded a compensation for “moral damage in an amount corresponding to the severity of the legal breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged event was to take place in 2009 at a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he reportedly raped them by documents submitted by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to the knees after the alleged incident and said that he was "99 percent a good guy", which was the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but say it was acceptable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later admitted to an extrajudicial agreement, since she had “a fear of revenge” and was careful to “be publicly humiliated”.
The 34-year-old said that she was now trying to withdraw the agreement, as she was still traumatized due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to change from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged event and changed this summer into a 100 million Euro heavy deal to the Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would “persevere” the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "permanently regret" if it lost its status as a world-leading car manufacturer after Brexit, according to Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark.
He further said that it was 'anxious' that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily interrupt production in the work in Burnston at Derby, the UK should leave the EU.
"We need a deal," says Clark.
The Japanese auto manufacturer indicated that the influence of delays on the border could lead to job loss in a no-deal brexit.
The work in Burnston, in which Toyotas product line Auris and Avensis are produced, produced almost 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that we will experience production stops at an uncontrolled Brexit End March," says Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyotas in Burnston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also allowed fear of a hard EU withdrawal without agreement and its influence on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its mini work in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
According to the car manufacturer, the main concerns are linked to risks within the supply chain at a hard Brexit.
Toyotas manufacturing plant is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the United Kingdom and the EU in order to make the cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, it could come to the limits of interruptions which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and difficulties in the parts.
It was impossible for Toyota to lead a stock in the work in Derbyshire which lasted longer than a day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa Mays Chequers' plan on the future relationship with the EU "is precisely designed to avoid such border controls".
“We need a deal. We want the best deal that allows us, as I said before, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity,” he explained in the BBC Radio 4 broadcast today.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we have to be able to continue the very successful delivery chains so far."
Toyota could not indicate how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the work and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and who is the highest official of the United States trade union, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience never comes back when they are just gone.
One government speaker said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's scheduled meetings with Rosenstein could be moved again according to White House data
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be moved "for another week", while the dispute over the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, was called from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has examined the supervision of the work of the Special Ombudsman Robert Mueller, who investigates the wave mixtures through Russia, the connections between Trump's consultants and Russia, as well as possible injustice by the presidents.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Minister of Justice and thereby endanger the independence of Mueller has been the subject of reports in Washington for a month.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had the opportunity to record his secret talks with Trump as well as the President's meeting using the 25th constitutional supplement.
Rosenstein dismissed the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports of his likely retreat were announced.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was held at that time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced on Thursday,
Trump explained that he would not let it go to Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to prevent him from collicating with the hearing before the U.S. Senate's judicial committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse.
On Friday Trump arranged a one-week FBI investigation of the proposals against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press speaker, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
She replied to a question about meeting Rosenstein: “A date has not yet been set for this. It could be this week, but I can still imagine that it will be moved in another week, given all the things that go directly with the Supreme Court.
This will show up, but I always like to keep the press on the run."
Some reporters would probably object to this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of press conferences did not lie in a rejection of the TV reporter's "effect hassherie" but added: "But I would not argue that they operate effect hassherie."
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President makes more questions and answers rounds than any president before him," she said, without providing precise evidence: "We have seen these figures."
There will still be press conferences, so Sanders, but it is “when the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly but far better than to talk to me.
We often try to do this and you've seen that we've done this often in the last few weeks. This will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump accepts regular questions when leaving the White House or taking part in open meetings or press conferences with visitors.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is so when he presented a bizarre performance in front of the assembled reporters.
Minister of Health writes because of Brexit's concerns about EU workers of the Scottish NHS
The Minister of Health appeals to persons from the EU abroad who work in Scotland for the National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and to express the wish that they remain in the country even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already declared itself willing to bear the costs of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
In your letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer the withdrawal negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued and decisions are expected this fall.
However, the UK government has also strengthened preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm aware of what disturbing times this must be for you all.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is full and full of your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christion Abercrombie was subjected to a head injury of a notoperation
The lineback of Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercrombie was reportedly subjected to a noto operation following a head injury on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, Head Coach of Tennessee State, explained to reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-life break.
"He came to the page line and was simply broken up there," says Reed.
Trainer and medical staff provided Abercrombie on the oxygen side line before being placed on a ladder and transported for further investigations.
A speaker from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the OP in the Vanderbild Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details of the nature or extent of the injury are yet known” and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called Redshirt, plays in its first season at Tennessee State after changing over from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he listed a total of 5 tattles, thus increasing his total number in the season to 18 tattles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
Investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax in the future for the purchase of properties in the United Kingdom. The additional revenues will benefit from the new plans of the Conservative Party without delay.
This step is intended to end the success of Jeremy Corby's campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will be all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance is counting on a multi-income of up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Theresa May today will announce that foreign investors have to pay a higher stamp fee when you purchase properties in the United Kingdom, with the benefit of more income without cover.
This step is an attempt to dampen Jeremy Corby's success with young voters, who promises to provide more affordable living space and take top value to the viewer.
The increase in stamp tax will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
In addition to the current stamp tax and including the two-year increase in residential property left on two-year-old apartments and rent, the increase may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance is counting by the step with more revenue of up to 120 million pounds per year.
Estimated 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not established in the United Kingdom. Thus, prices are driven up and it will be harder for first-time buyers to take foot in the real estate business.
Many well-being areas of the country, especially in the capital city, have become "citizens" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson expressed his intention to reduce the tax on stamps to allow more young people the first home.
He accused construction companies of keeping the real estate prices high by buying land without using it, and urged Theresa May to put quotas on affordable apartments to end the British 'dwelling damage'."
The opposition leader Corbyn announced a spectacular series of proposals for residential reform, ranging from a rental price bond to the ban of rooms without a valid reason.
He also wants to include city councils with more powers in the construction of new apartments.
May stated: “Last year, I said that I would devote my time to the prime minister of the restoration of the British dream, according to which the life of generation should be improved.
And that means repairing our broken apartment market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it cannot be true that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, as it is for companies based abroad to buy real estate as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of home has become too much for too many people and the worthlessness of unhappiness continues to be a big problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, says it was his “greatest goal” to ever become the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Shot enjoys the challenge of raising a new life for the association from the north-east of England, which is just in the third place in the League One and lacks three points to the top.
He took this summer to the stadium of Light after taking St. Mirren back in the last season to the first Scottish league.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bank and that’s what Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
“But I’ve seen as a child with my father often playing Scotland in Hampden and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I were successful in the management of the association."
Ross predecessors in the role as manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic suggested not to be afraid to enter the footsteps of such established names at such a club after he previously refused offers from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured at the moment if I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and possibilities of this association, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he explained.
“It is not an easy task to get him there, but I would think that my time here is only a success if I bring the association back there.”
Ross can present a first three-year management career, after a phase as deputy chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month activity as a coach in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says he now feels better than ever in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"That was probably a real route," he recalls when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds funny because I didn't get sick, I could live well of it and experience some very pleasant stages.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to do every week.
I still do this with regard to stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I do it. I've never felt like an adult in my skin in my whole life."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 17:30, so a study
The heat wave in the summer missed the revenues of British crissling pubs, while restaurant chains ran under greater pressure.
In July, public and bar companies recorded a sales growth of 2.7 per cent. However, the revenues at the restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, from the CGA company council, which compiled the figures, explained: “Sustainable sunshine and England longer than expected continuous participation in the World Cup, meant that July followed a pattern similar to that of previous June, in which Pub's sales increased by 2.8 percent. However, the restaurant found it even harder.
The fall of 1.8 percent, recorded by the restaurant industry in June, continued in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on drinks showed the best performance at a distance, with a flat-adjusted sales development that rose higher than they dropped at the restaurants.
Pubs focused on food in the sun as well, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
It seems like the people wanted to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, the drinking rates increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the food line decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, of the analysts for the RSM leisure and hospitality industry, explained: “These results continue to be the trend that we have been able to observe since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the Out-of-Home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still struggling with problems, but sales revenues of 4.8 percent over the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the continuing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have reached a worse time for business operators with a focus on food, and it remains to be expected that the more suitable temperatures will be provided in August with the urgently needed atempause."
The total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in the brand rollouts.
The Sector Exchange Monitor Box Peak Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant area in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognized industry benchmark.
One of five children has secret accounts in social media, which it hides from his parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some once 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret in front of parents and teachers
An survey of 20,000 students in further schools has found an increase in the so-called "Fake Insta" pages
The message prompts fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students indicated having a "main account" to show it to their parents
One of five children, some just 11 years of age, creates social media accounts that can keep it secret from adults.
An survey of 20,000 students in further schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, an introduction to the Photo-Sharing website Instagram.
The message fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of the students indicated that they had a clean "main account" that they could show their parents, but that they also had private accounts.
A mother who stood on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged the other to "strengthen me."
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of the HMC, said: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being driven to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Elid Doyle will be the "vote of athletes" in the Scottish Sports Council
At its annual General Meeting, Elid Doyle was elected non-executive member of the Council of the Scottish Litigation Association of Scottish Athletics.
Doyle is Scotland's most outstanding light athlete and President Ian Beattie described the choice as a great opportunity for athletes to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilid is respected in the Scottish, UK and the world's Light Athletic Society and we are sure that light athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from their election in the Council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I am happy to act as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American who won a distance of over 200 and 400 meters in 1996 at the Olympic Games in Atlanta called four Olympic gold medals his own and today often appears as BBC experts could no longer run after a temporary bleeding disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't run anymore.
The doctors say no one can tell me if or how far I'm going to be healed.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to run again and make movement exercises today!
Thank you very much for the encouraging news!"
An advertising for milk pumps that compare mothers to cows provides excitement in the network
A manufacturer of milk pumps provided an excitement net with a advertising clip in which the still mother is compared to the milk of cows.
For the market introduction of the "first soundproofed milk pump" in the world, the manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie publishes a non-serious music video to highlight the freedom that the pump gives to silent mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a bowl filled with cows in the background with cows to a song containing the lines of text like: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see me a tail" or "if you haven't noticed it, it's not yours but my breasts."
In the refrain it goes on to say: “Spump it out, pump it out, feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladyes.”
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has triggered a controversy on the network.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video focused on mixed reactions among the audiences, many of whom say it is harmless to the "freaks" of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to apply for this product with cows.
Like us, they have to be polite and bring a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys will be taken away within less days of birth," said one comment.
The milk pump of Elvie fits in a still-BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Recognizable traumatically for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply for a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: “So a strange advertising.”
Others defended the advertising and a woman said that you found the song "urcomically".
“I find it to be a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if I'd still be quiet.
When I was pumping, I felt just like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to reinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny advertising directed at mothers to use milk pumps (often at work or in toilets) and feel like “Cows”.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone danced with the discreet pumps in their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who use milk pumps show themselves to feel like milk cows.
However, the pump of Elvie is completely cloudy, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a still-BH, allowing women to be able to move, hold their babies or even go out during the pump process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, explained: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a bold and provocative market introduction.
Through the comparison of still mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to put milk pumps and all the challenges involved in this, and at the same time, in a entertaining and tangible way, to present the incredible feeling of freedom that enables the new pump.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump runs into the strike lines.
During the London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski appeared a double mother on the catwalk while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were brought quietly to a tent town on the Texan border
While the number of internally displaced children is as high as ever before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively the same, among other things, the increased rhetoric and measures of the Trump government have made it more difficult to bring children under care.
Traditionally, most administrators were illegal immigrants themselves and are now afraid to become themselves the target disc for an extradition when they report to pick up a child.
In June, as the Federal authorities announced, potential managers and other adult members of their household had to print their fingerprints and share this data with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Customs Immigration and Customs Force, explained before the Congress that the authorities arrested dozens of people who had complained about the care of unaccompanied minors.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had no prior entry into the criminal register.
“Almost 80 per cent of the persons who are either a manager themselves or a member of a household of a manager are illegally staying in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
That is why we will continue to pursue these people," Albence explained.
In order to be able to process the cases of children more quickly, officials introduced new rules which, according to employees of the accommodation in some children, required to appear within a month instead of 60 days after the hearing before the court, which was the standard.
Many will appear by video switch and not personally to appear before an immigration court for their legal status.
In the case of negative decisions, the person is quickly dismissed.
The longer these children stay safe, the more likely it is according to the information provided by the accommodation staff and reports that have been announced from the system in the last month that they are afraid and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreaks.
Defenders say that these concerns will be reinforced in a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there signs that a child has problems will be more easily overlooked due to the size.
They also explained that traumata, which many of the children are already suffering, can be strengthened if they are brought into a tent city without emotional preparation or sufficient time to decide with friends.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish “Bestage troops” to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in eight years.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, explained that the foreign forces were illegally on the Syrian soil in the face of the fight against terrorism and were "treated accordingly".
"You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he explained to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terrorism almost passed" was in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus "will continue to fight this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed" both of terrorist groups and of "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has stationed approximately 2000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish fighters and Syrian Arabs, who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 ground troops in the war-sponsored country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were met and he accused "some Western countries" of spreading "Irrational fears" and of keeping refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to enable the return of the country," he said.
"They are in fact policing a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that no building aid would be granted to Syria unless there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition in order to end the war.
The UN diplomats explained that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel capital Idlib represents the opportunity for political talks to take place.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a broad-based offensive of the Syrian forces supported by Russia into the province in which three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had clear deadlines and expressed his hope that military action against jihadists, including combatants of the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, would be carried out.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee, consisting of government and opposition members, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem referred to the conditions of the Syrian Government for participation in the Committee and explained that its work should be limited to "recasting the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win his re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal spectators are likely to expect, conclude an office or scandal.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all times".
So far, there are no signs that the viewers have been sitting.
Since 2014, the number of active rates for the best transmission time for CNN has doubled to 1.05 million more than doubled and for MSNBC to 1.6 million almost dispersal.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million viewers for the best shipping time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBCs “The Rachel Maddow Show” conducted the auction rates with up to 3.5 million viewers at evenings with important news.
"This is like a fire that drives people magically, because it's something we don't understand," says Neal Bear, Showrunner, the drama series "Designed Survivor" on TV broadcast on a cabinet member, the president, will be destroyed after an attack on the capital.
Nell Scovell, an old-fashioned comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Five Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has another theory.
She recalls a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd choose Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
The chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, the stories from Washington can, in contrast to anything on television, determine the future of the principle decision on deductions Roe v. Wade, the possible integration of families and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it is also an informed citizen when one is aware of having seen six hours of an expert round that Bob Woodward's use of sources from the so-called "Deep Background" for his book "Fair", Paul Manafort's $15,000 expensive fire jacket from Strausßenleder (declared Washington Post as "a piece of clothing rich in self-esteem") or discussing the effects of Stormy Daniel's traveling description of Trumps, emm, anatomy.
For my part, Super Mario will never be able to see again with the same eyes.
“A part of what he does can be felt like a reality show that he presides over every evening,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series “The Three of the Pfandhaus”, about Trump’s rotating occupation and daily performances (a fight with the football league NFL from the zoo, Kim Jong-un prizes).
You can't afford to miss a result, otherwise you won't come with.
When I reached Feiss this week, there were 27 degrees ahead of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he broke in and looked at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He simply could not get out of the screen, not when Brett Kavanaugh was in the forefront of speaking before the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy missions and the people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turned out that they were right."

Donations of cash with the strictest race around the conference at the mid-elections
It is a little surprising that the 17th election district of Pennsylvania is overrun by donation, thanks to the newly drawn boundaries of the electoral district, which led to two officials standing in the race around the same seat.
The recently redesigned suburb of Pittsburgh allows the Democratic Conor Lamb to take place, who won his seat in another district during a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb acts against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily overcrowded with the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the decision of the State High Court of Pennsylvania in January that the old areas were moved against the Constitution and manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district resulted in an exchange of election funding between the parties' large financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was announced in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a highly respected special election in March around the 18th election district of the state.
This seat was held over a decade by a Republican and Trump won 20 percentage points in it.
Political experts hold the democratic leaders in an easy way.
The US examined the punishment of El Salvador for its support for China, but then returned
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized, without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump completed a friendly meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama to partner the Trump Organization management team.
Officials of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the heads of all US overseas representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the latest decisions not to recognise Taiwan" as Heather Nauert, speaker of the Ministry in an opinion at the beginning of the month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador, a criminal measure estimated at $140 million in 2017 was considered for US aid, including for drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed criminal measures, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder.
While internal meetings have progressed, North and Central American officials have moved a high-level conference on security and economic well-being, which should follow a similar meeting in the previous year and represent a step forward in efforts to stop migrants from moving towards the USA.
In mid-September, however, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and thus effectively ended the consideration of criminal measures for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled as a speaker at the conference in mid-October to place a sign, according to diplomats, of the importance that the government of the assembly can bring.
The three American diplomatic representatives are silent and quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new strong communications or sanctions from Washington.
One spokesperson of John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to speak on the basis of anonymity for internal discussions.
Their opinions were confirmed by one of the government's close external analysts, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learn From the History
The next big surprise could be the report of Special Agent Robert Mueller on Trump's possible injustice, for which there are now sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller is now allegedly also investigating whether Trump's election team has been conspiring with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
If the majority of the congress changes, look at Trump confronted with an organ that forces him to account, and that is exactly when he prepares to approach the voters again; and perhaps before a jury.
That is a lot of 'because' and I do not want to say that the Donald Trump case, or the European pendant, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic we have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938 German officers were ready to carry out a state strike against Hitler, if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We have failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of the barbarians who followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unsustainable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing a number of such turning points.
What do we do when Trump dismisses Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, so the man who decides on the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been running the kitchen in Teufels since last year reported that he proposed to record the presidents secretly and speculated about it, although it was inappropriate for the office.
Rosenstein neglects the presentation of the New York Times.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly ordered FBI investigation is not complete or fair or is confirmed in spite of credible allegations of sexual abuse and misdemeanour in the office?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a convention that forces the Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, we have a long winter ahead.
But I believe we will not fail because of what I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz from the same regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to burn Sabbath candles on the table with the hooker.
How can I not be optimistic about this legacy?"

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers Optimistically in front of the game against Vienna
The rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive remis against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will be transferred to a good position for the qualification of the Group G of Europe League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans was unable to reach the 2-2 level against Villareal, but he believes that the rangers can use this result as a jumpboard for larger sizes.
"This was an important point for us, because Villareal is very good," said the 31-year-old.
We went to the game with the conviction that we could do something about it and we drove home with a point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but overall an indecision was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we insisted in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, however, this will be a difficult party, as they have achieved a good result in the last game. But I am sure that we can get through it with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of feeling factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind and be successful."
Fear of old age leads women to sleepless nights.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the female participants in the nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said to talk to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-Presidents of the National Insurance Party.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you want to be treated, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your advisor can also help you find an opportunity to finance these expenditures.
Their financial decisions for long-term care may include traditional maintenance insurance, hybrid life-forming insurance to help cover these costs or self-assurance with your own assets - as long as they have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Apply legal disputes in the last minute.
Set up a precautionary authority so that you can entrust a trusted person with the task of monitoring your medical care and ensuring that health professionals comply with your wishes, you should be able to express this yourself.
Consider also a full power for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about taking medicine or allergies?
Note these details in a written plan, so you are ready.
"Not only the financial questions play a role. Who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
‘What is the drug treatment?’
Who cares about the dog?

Men in Ilfracombe shot several times with air defence
A man was shot several times with a gun when he went home after a job with friends.
The victim, a man in the 14th century, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
Officials describe the shots that took place around 02:30 British time, as a "willful act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries were not life threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, so the authorities were allowed to increase the number of deaths.
Because of the resulting communication systems, aid forces were not able to obtain information from the Dongalla government district, an area north of Palu, which is located near the epicenter of the earthquake with the magnitude 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster in Palu.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary just as the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dondgala is a county in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi that extends over a coastal area of over 300 km (180 miles) long.
In the government district, an administrative unit below the province, lived in 2017 estimated 299,200 people.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income of the Central-Sulawesis economy, in particular the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickellabbau is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
According to Indonesia’s disaster protection authority, Palu and Dongala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938 over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
West Dongala was hit in 1996 by a tsunami in which nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire ring, and is regularly visited by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra broke out on 26 December a tsunami that hit 14 countries and cost the lives of 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands before the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake with a force of 6,8 scared the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and called for almost 700 deaths.
2009: A earthquake with the strength of 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 spewed one of the Mentawai islands in front of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake has spewed the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died by a stormy building.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the popular Indonesian island of Lombok and, above all, called for over 500 deaths on the northern side of the island.
The bee destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily beached on the island.
Sarah Palin's son was arrested for projections of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Governor Alaska and former candidates for the vice president's office, was arrested on the grounds of the allegations of bodily injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspecting domestic violence, for preventing the notification of domestic violence and for resisting State violence, such a report published by the Alaska police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he accepted the phone when he wanted to understand the police.
Palin, according to KTUU, is in investigation in the Mat-Su Pretral Facility and a deposit of 500 dollars has been raised.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he, when asked for his plea, replied with "no guilt, absolutely sure," as the network.
Palin is accused of having committed three legal objections to Class A, which can be dealt with with up to one year of imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000.
He will also be charged with a class B objection, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time that Palin's criminal shows were picked up.
In December 2017 he was proposed to have attacked his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was subjected to domestic violence, a violation of the notification of a crime and possession of weapons, under the influence of anti-pollution agents in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend suggested you beat her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by veterinary organizations after returning her son’s behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami by Earthquakes in Indonesia: one hundred dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The bee with a force of 7.5 dissolved a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Power and communications networks are interrupted and it is assumed that the number of deaths will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just before the coast of Central Sulawesis, which is located north-east of the capital Jakarta of Indonesia.
On the social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Rare Death Penalty for Suspects in New York Terror Attack
The federal prosecutor in New York calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the accused in the terrorist attack of New York City, who cost eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has been suspended for a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of having used a rented pick-up of the construction chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, in the course of which he rode on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and carried pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "targeted" and "consciously" seriously injured the body, so it is in the declaration of intent to demand the death penalty filed in the south of New York.
Both charges could be punishable by death according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court of inquiry, Saipov, filed a case in 22 points containing eight charges of the murder in front of organised crime, normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of vehicles.
The attack called for 'basic planning and purpose', so that the prosecutors, who carried out the act in Saipov, described it as 'disgusting, cruel and degrading'.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage, pain and loss," said the statement.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the southern district of New York did not pursue a case with the goal of demanding the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was accused of murdering two drug suppliers and was finally sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in New York at a federal crime was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been accused of swearing two years earlier to commit espionage to the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were furnished with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, testified in the days and months following the attack of a lack of remorse, so to speak.
He told me before the investigators that he felt good about what he did, so the police.
Saipov explained to the authorities that he was actually inspired by the fact that after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, he was accused.
He also called for police reports to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He declared himself innocent in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public defenders represented by Saipov, explained that they were "depressed of course" because of the decision of the State Prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to request the death penalty instead of a debt in exchange for a life-long release penalty will only extend the trauma suffered by all parties,” Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously requested the prosecution not to demand the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party asks NIGEL FARAGE to transfer Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the power of the people" today during a protest in the course of the Tours conference.
Ukip's former leader stated that politicians "must feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics, while Theresa May's party deputy suggested that Farage should lead negotiations with the EU.
The conservative back banker Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would already be outside" if Farage Brexit was minister.
The challenge facing May in the reconciliation of its deeply disputed party was reinforced by the fact that members of your party who are for a stay in the EU participated in a separate demonstration against the Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems keeping her Cheques' compromise plan in spite of attacks by Brexit supporters, Brexit agents and the EU on course.
They agreed that, despite their reactions, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and thus force Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the Chaos.
Bone explained at the “Leave Means Leave” demonstration in Solihull that “Checkers belong to the trash”.
He suggested that Farage should have been mentioned as a peer and that he should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were responsible for this, we would already be outside,” he explained.
The Commissioner of Wellingborough added: “I will stand for Brexit, but Chequers belongs to the mine.”
He stressed his opposition to the EU: "We have not fought in world wars to be subjugated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected claims that the public opinion has changed since the referendum in 2016: “The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
The Brexit Deputy of Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also on the demonstration and told reporters: “I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and with our activists, who actually walk through the streets and ensure that we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.’
She went on to say in a final message in May: “Minister of State will keep her jobs if you keep her promises.”
Farage stated in an address that politicians need to “ feel the pressure”, that they should be in the process of misleading the 2016 referendum decision.
“This is now a matter of confidence between us, the people, and our political class”, said Farage.
“They are trying to cheat the Brexit and therefore we are here today to say to them, ‘You do not come from it’.
He continued, “I want you to let our political class, who is just before betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We mobilize the power of the people of this country, which will give us victory in the referendum and never come to peace, until we are no independent, self-regulatory, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before they had a two-hour broadcast in the city center.
A few activists waved banners of the Tories Against Brexit Grouping, a group of Brexit genres within May's party, which was launched at the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, was making fun of the tours that had security problems with a party app when the conference opened.
“These are the people who tell us that they can ensure that the IT systems, like all the technology for Canada Plus, are available for free trade without frontiers in Ireland,” said Adonis.
"That's a farce.
There is simply no good Brexit’, he added.
Warren planned to “examine closely” the presidential candidacy.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren explained that after the elections in November, she would "examine the presidential candidacy accurately".
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachousts Democrats spoke about their future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, is in the race to re-election the Senate against the Republican MPs in the Parliament of Massachusetts Geoff Diehl, who was vice-president of Trump's election team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the focus of speculation that it could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was since Trump's entry into office. Its 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format.
One of the persons present asked her if you would like to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it would be for women at the time "to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top."

The police of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the case of the deadly shots on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested from Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m. in the morning of Eastern Time.
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to be seen on the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot injury on his head and died as a result of this injury”, reported the sports media portal 247sports police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and given permission to be on the roof and possession of a weapon and have shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.

Great price of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after his team has left him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time that Valtteri Bottas landed on Saturday in qualifying before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Stallorder of Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From the Pole position, Botta's success was a good start, and it was almost as he led Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and announced that he would attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton enter the traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went a round later into the box and landed behind the belt, but took Hamilton after a short wheel-an-rad-manover, in which the Ferrari-pilot disassembled the inside, with the risk of pulling out two movements to defend the third curve.
Max disappeared on one of the back squares of the field and was on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round in place seven.
He was then for most of the race of the fastest, as he kept on his tires to finish quickly and pick up Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
He finally went in the 44th round into the box and failed to take a step in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen ended up as the fourth.
It was a difficult day since Valteri had been doing an excellent job all weekend and how a genuine gentleman had acted when he was supposed to leave me.
The team has done excellent work to win a double victory," says Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of a election event on Saturday about Senator Diane Feinstein, who insisted that Christine Blasey Ford, in which he proposed sexual abuse to the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, not to be handed over to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford's statement before the Senate's Justice Committee was not directly addressed, but commented that the proceedings in the Senate show that people are "common, wicked and dishonest".
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and angry and ugly and rude," said the President.
“If you look at the leaks and then say, “Oh, I wasn’t.
I wasn't."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, just a minute.
If we... no, we didn't publish it," he added by imitating the senator's voice.
Feinstein was awarded the letter with Ford's charges against Kavanaugh in July and was published at the beginning of September. However, Feinstein argues that the body comes from its office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't publish your story," Feinstein explained to the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret and I responded to her request for confidentiality."
Your dementia did not seem good to the president, who said on Saturday evening at the election event: “I tell you one thing, it was a very bad language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defense of the judge's candidacy, which three women were accused of sexual abuse, the Democrats would use the charges for their own purposes.
‘They are determined to regain the power by all means.
One sees the community, the wickedness, they don't worry about who they hurt when they get under the wheels to get power and control," the president said the media.

Flylotse died after he made sure that hundreds of people in a plane escaped the earthquake
A plane flying in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found death in order to secure the start of a plane with hundreds of people on board.
Over 800 people die and many are lost after the island of Sulawesi was frightened on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong remnants are still to be felt in the region and many people are trapped under drummers in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your life, the 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his posts in the highly swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to make sure that the flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was then on the runway, could safely depart.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was crashing.
Major died later in the hospital.
Johanneses Sirat, spokesperson for the Indonesian Air Safety Service, explained that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are deeply concerned about this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths could increase to several thousand. The disaster protection authority of the country stated that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to rise, as many bodies are still among the drums, while others cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.

You've been ready for this." So CNN.
Indonesia was already shot this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports from a missing aircraft crash in Laguna
The airline, which conducted the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports from a missing person after first claiming that all 47 passengers and the occupation were safe from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that they could not say anything until Saturday afternoon about the stay of a passenger.
The airline agreed to cooperate with the local authorities, hospitals and investigators in order to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane was pushed into the water when trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that on Saturday six passengers were still in the hospital, but were in a stable condition.
The cause and exact outcome of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both explained that the plane landed just before the runway in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying out of the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane hit very flat.
"That's a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others could water through deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he suffered a smaller head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that mattresses that were working nearby to improve an installation were driven with a blower boat to help bring people to the coast before the plane fell in about 30 meters (100 feet) deep water.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network can be seen that 111 people have been killed by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them have been affected by Air Niguini.
Analyst reconstructs the end of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded on Saturday its evidence in the renegotiation of a case in which a man was proposed to have banned a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the American Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he, on the basis of phone calls, reconstructed the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on her deathbed.
Rowlett said to have received position data from various phones that showed that Tellis was together with Chambers at the night of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, so the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers during the time he indicated to be at his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford came into the stand on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he indicated that he had been in Sanford's Pick-Up this night, Sandford said he had lied, "when my Pick-Up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis indicated that Chambers had known at their time of death for two weeks.
But phone records indicated that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis released some time after Chamber's death their messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He took them out of his life," Hale said.
The defense will likely begin on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the procedure is then before the jury on that day.

Another black?!
New Yorker girls couple complained about a release after "racist" SMS
A New York girl complained to a couple because of a discriminatory dismissal after she received a misdirected message from her mother, in which she complained that she was "not yet a black person".
The couple struggles to be racist and compared to a 'pression'.
The double mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her frustration when she found out that the new mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEIEN, OTHER AWARD," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending this message to her husband, however, she sent the message to Maurice.
After she recognized her Fauxpass, she decided that Plasco-Flaxman Maurice had been hurt and claimed that the African-American mother had done a bad job and she had been expecting a Filipino instead, so the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her work day and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice has charged the couple with compensation for the dismissal and makes a claim for compensation for the $350 per day, which she should last for six months, the job for which she was originally booked, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look what you're not doing," she said on Friday, "I know that discrimination is."
The couple turned back the racist proposals and argued that the release of the sensible step was because they feared Maurice, after they had hurt her, could no longer be trusted.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," explained Ehemann Joel Plasco of the Post.
“But would you trust your children in a person who was unfair to them, even if it was unlawful?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the legal dispute with an "expression" and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was "in a difficult situation".
“Do you want to interest such a person?
This is not very nice," the investment banker added.
While the dispute continues, the couple was quickly convicted in the public and pressed on social media, where they were criticised for their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves with a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It is difficult to move into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our knowledge of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC, had been inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, no problem with it, would have been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death in the last year was "bitterly sweet".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, which she describes as “very important family member”.
"He was a very quiet man and didn't cry," says Jankel.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child that makes something special: you are proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Although he invented it and created it, he always gave Paddington himself responsible for his success."
My daughter died and I had to take her over the phone.
After the country, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur hospital in Nice, where the doctors were reluctantly trying to save her life.
“Nad regularly called to say that it looks really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance,” said Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to resign from her.
And that's what I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications you have given the doctors to keep their heart on the pump, they cry slowly and leave their body.
She had just died, and that was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't wait to do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn't scream or scream because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperous, who was now grieving for the loss of her daughter, went along with the other passengers who had nothing to do with what she was going through, on board the aircraft.
"No one knew," she said.
I had fallen my head and tears all the time over the waves.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women hang cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost their family through a suicide attempt to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hang on a bridge in Wales maps with inspiring messages and phone numbers for consulting stations.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he started suicide.
"I don't want parents to feel like I feel every day," she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and he had a burning smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could bring a room to light."
However, he announced his job before his death, since he was “in a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide of his 11-year-old brother.
Davis said: "I always feared that this could have an effect."
Davis has designed the cards “to show people that there are people to whom one can go and who one can talk even if he is a friend.
Don't be silent: you need to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not say that he was depressed or depressed," she explained.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at the bottom of the well on Christmas Day, and when the children took their gifts out, he saw them not in his eyes, nor any thing.
She said that his death was a great trauma to her, but that through it they had to say: “It’s a huge hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the Sweep while the FBI starts with investigations
"I thought that if we actually got something like that he was asking for, so a temporary and limited investigation, we might be able to get a little interview," Flake said on Saturday. He feared that the committee in the party state would be "extremely broken".
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
Your will can only be attributed to the timing.
The elections on 6 November are only five weeks away. If the Republicans cut out as expected badly, then they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to choose their husband in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush contacted the phone reader to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh. He had worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to decide in equality of vote, and to confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean crossings “low” under Kim
The number of North Korean crossings to South Korea has fallen to power since Kim Jong-and seven years ago, such as a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, which is based on data from the South Korean Reunition Ministry, explained that last year 1127 crossings were registered, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices of human smugglers than major factors.
Pjöngang did not publicly express himself.
The majority of the crossings from the north are finally offered by the South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most of them fly across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the crossings to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often returns with violence.
The relations between the north and the south, which are still technically seen in the war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two Heads of State met in Pjöngang to discuss the proposed denuclearisation negotiations.
This was due to the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work on a developed Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of the lack of progress.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is not suitable for the Office of the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the representative's house Nancy Pelosi called Judge Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could not deny the impression that a woman who had acted as such would have been referred to as “historic”, Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate’s Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denounced all the charges that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
During his opening talk, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he screamed almost and stood out in tears just before speaking of his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and called the charges against him a "great and coordinated reputation" organised by Liberals, who were angry about Hillary Clinton's lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was taking precedence over the Democrats.
"I believe that he has made these statements and the way in which he brought about the Clintons and the Democrats, even for the sake of inadvertently," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to extract Kavanaugh from the office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also inappropriate for his current court positions," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi continued that she was concerned as a democratic about possible decisions by Kavanaughs against the Affordable Care Act or the decision to abolish Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh asked whether he would review certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We don’t need a hysterical, pre-conceived person who goes to this court and expects us to say, ‘I’m not wonderful’, says Pelosi.
Women must use it as a weapon.
It is a sincere hate speech, months and years of overcrowding anger, and it does not get out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steine told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, and you?"
She added: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she even wept when she got angry but developed a technique. When she gets angry and starts to cry, tell her to the person she said: “They may think that I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just keeps talking.
I found that great."
Tren are permitted as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearer memories is to a former job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I cried out because of an indescribable anger and by an older woman, a cold manager, before whom I was always a little afraid, was packed into a stairwell.
"Never let her see that you're crying," she told me.
“You don’t know that you’re tinkering.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy with you because they think you've gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Hart was acquired on board a ship named Monkey Business in an extraordinary affair and then withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schreeder wondered that there was no reason to consider the idea of the presidential candidacy itself.
"That was not a well thought-out decision," she told me 30 years later with a smile.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation ‘Schneewittchen and the seven twins’.
Since the election campaign had already progressed, it was at the back of the middle purchase and she swore not to run if she was not supposed to get $2 million.
It was a searchless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who spent $1,000 on men, only supported their campaign with $250.
"Do you think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
In her speech, in which she announced not to start official campaign, she was so grateful for her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system that made the procurement and direct address of the voters so difficult instead of the delegates, and the anger about sexism so overwhelming that she stood close to the tears.
"You could have assumed that I suffered a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the bag manufacturer Kleinex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my gravestone.
"Sie Wente"?"
Why Beijing could benefit from the U.S.-China trade war
The opening of the trade war between the United States and China were horrendous. Although the battle is not long past, Beijing could benefit from a dig between the countries in a long way, my experts.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning panel at the beginning of the year when he charged important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminium, with fines.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new fines on goods worth $200 billion, which effectively affects half of all goods imported from China into the United States.
Beijing returned in the same way every time and recently raised fines from five to ten percent on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has sworn to respond to any US measure, and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon collapse.
To move Washington to join, it would mean to repeat, but a public inkling would be too much fun for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, my experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit in the long term from the effects of the trade war by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries in Washington or Beijing is in fact much more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized," says Abigail Grace, a scientific employee who focuses on Asia in the Center for New American Security at the thinking factory.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, so the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding the country that has been devastated by the war over seven years.
In an address before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem stated that the circumstances in the country are improving.
"Today, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation on the ground is more stable and more secure," he explained.
The government rebuilds the areas destroyed by terrorists to allow normality to be reversed.
All the conditions are now given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily and life-based goals.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that there would be no acceptance of conditional aid from the countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe won a victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018 and won the US team with an end of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points that it needed to defeat the United States.
The American Star Phil Mickelson, who had problems with most of the tournament, reduced his strike on the 16th train (Par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has been able to shine in all its rounds and has been one of 4 players who achieved a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was hit at 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to win back the podal.
It is about the team and I am happy to have made a contribution," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He still reaches the fable at his countryman John Rahm, who won the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 in the individual encounters.
I am so proud to have beaten Tiger Woods that I've been watching TV since my childhood," says the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A remarkable statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, which has won 14 important titles and is surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
The US team had to find the fairways all week long, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who have performed high-quality performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of the boys, they have fought.
There was a time tomorrow when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything about it.
Get out of here for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players put off a good performance.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
