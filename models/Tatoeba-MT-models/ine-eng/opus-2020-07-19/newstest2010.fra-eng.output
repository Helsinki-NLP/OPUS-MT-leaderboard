Barack Obama will be the fourth US President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo in Norway to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth president of the story to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded to him, among other things, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a programme.
It will first go to the Nobel Institute, where it will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who elected it in October among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then provides for an interview with the king of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will meet its summit in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious reward.
He will be the fourth US President to receive it, but only the third to be awarded the prize in the Committee's own body.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the time of the award.
The President does not want to avoid this because he is aware that he is receiving this prize by being a president who carries out a war in two countries at the present time.
He strengthened his war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics would forget to stress.
During the ceremony Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million Euros).
He is counting on doing charity work, but he has not yet decided which.
His program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of the government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this price at the beginning.
For example, he mentioned having the feeling not to deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that this is not a price for himself, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
From the announcement, he stated that it would be an "invite to act".
A defendant of the accused nature of blackmail
The Lithuanian police accused the president of blackmailing the Association of Protectors of the nature of Lithuania.
On several occasions last year, he appealed for several construction works procedures and asked for money from investors for his personal benefit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesperson for the Lithuanian police.
The President of the Society of Protectors of the Nature of Lithuania is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and is at risk for up to three years in prison.
Waste trims are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can choose their drinks packages, while in the villages of South Moravia, you fall on tries at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take a few minutes before you find the right goods.
I'm not saying that we wouldn't be able to pick up all the waste in Brno.
But I feel that the municipal councillors of our town, the second largest city in the country, are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is at the age of the stone of the tri of the waste not only because citizens can still pick only paper, glass and PVC, but especially because of the number of items devoted to these wastes.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city center?
It's all science, which especially requires time and steel nerves.
The only place I've found for the moment is Moravia's place in front of Potrefena Husa.
Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't want me to, but I don't think so.
Without talking about the fact that in other neighborhoods of the city it is not a safe one anymore.
So to end, many of my friends don't choose their waste.
By the light.
It's a trick for them to get to the property.
I'm not surprised about them.
I myself, after a party, proposed to go throw some bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any Kounicova street color bands.
Luckily, I found the right place by taking the tram.
That's what it says, the waste was getting away with.
It's after the center of Brno, which is supposed to best represent the city, right?!
It is likely that ecology and alleged aestheticism are not very interested in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city a first hockey league place that shames the city throughout the country, instead of buying some additional goods and offering the three more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am happy to have been able to comfort my impression with official statistics after spending a moment online.
According to ECO-KOM data, Brno is indeed the worst in the entire Moravia region of the South.
Paroubek's budget is from retired silver and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the Government's opinion, farmers or civil servants may lack money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for the interests of the State's debt or international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social-democratic and communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will make loans for sensitive spending, retirement or sick leave. "It is not just to solve the problems later, to mine the land," Janota said.
It must be known that the interest to be paid on the borrowed money is increasing and that it will have to be repaid sooner or later.
The state doesn't really have the choice to know where to get money.
If it does not reduce social aid or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those who have now increased to the left: firefighters, educators, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and should not fear for their retirement or sickness insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a larger debt of the state - next year it will not miss 163 billion in cash, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will thus increase more rapidly and with it, interest-related expenditures.
The State will need money to feed it, and it will not be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
It will also lack five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
This is mainly a decision-making and start-ups that may not be possible to change the projects to reduce costs.
Always keep them, which is not free or free.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major construction sites, and the collection of European funds is also in danger, according to Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport.
ČSSD has proposed to settle the financial deficit very quickly - it will be able in the dividends of ČEZ (electric power supplier and distributor), that the State has a major share and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not in any case a well without funds.
Last year, there were 18 billion who have been navigated from the Czech Republic to the budget.
Every year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of environmental damage, to complete retirement accounts, or to serve as a reserve for pension reform.
This also increases the actual budget deficit of 5.7% of GDP according to EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various damages to the victims of communism and crimes, even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we forgive an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save from the department or, in the worst case, touch the government's budget reserve.
There is also a lack of one hundred million in the two-billion-dollar State Fund project, which should allow an online monitoring of the expenditures of each administration.
The first stage will begin in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would have taken place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing one button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
It's enough of a button and you'll be passing from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the objective of the American company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of computer virtualization software.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can change between them, you can distinguish them as staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company said in an interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and it was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is nothing but fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, with a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a Nokia N800 modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, which was simultaneously running the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is currently working with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to current devices in 2012.
The snow shortage in the mountains disturbs the hotels
Desert trails only cause problems for lift-up operators.
The lack of snow deters people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to destroy free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits on our website.
Netizens travel through offers, demand prices, but do not hesitate to book for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud in Noël," said Martin Jandura, exploiting the Spindl.Info information portal.
If we want to spend the New Year's dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, it's better not to hesitate to book.
If economics are given priority and the quality of the accommodation comes only immediately, then we can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler hotels offer only one week's stay for New Year.
I think they're going to try to place them again, but they're going to drop them, too, and they're going to take shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura estimated.
The Ingtours of Vrchlabí tourism agency also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We are most interested in Christmas for the moment, it is not fully sold.
It still remains free, let's say, half the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared some less expensive Christmas stays," Ingtours Petr Schiefert said.
The Vrchlabí tourism agency can also offer New Year in Krkonoshe, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February go as well, the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year, interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoshe.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the snowless mountain.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, the hotel's occupation of Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of almost five percent.
We have a few last seats for New Year as for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the holidays of January of the Polish and February also sells well," reports Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The hotel Omnia near the central parking area of Jánské Lázně is also complete at four and a half percent during the New Year's period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty in Noël in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already had a 60% employment at the present time.
February is a little lower for the moment but as soon as the snow falls, the interest for stays in the Krkonoshes will certainly grow again indicated the hotel manager Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
However, the hotels of Krkonoshe should not expect more snow.
Thursday it will be fresher and if there is any precipitation, they should be snowed in the mountains.
But then the time should warm up, reports Jiří Jakubský from the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Repeating is a mother of wisdom
He even became a comic, the assiduous effort with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of wisdom, reproduced his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan issue, which he considered himself to be simple.
When he ended up sweating his doctrine so eagerly, he found that he had copied it to the carbon paper since Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the expression "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, which is, to use the title of Bush's January 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: "A new road ahead"
At the same time, he personally criticised Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements into a Iraq consumed by civil war as "an irresponsible and catastrophic decision in its consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which contained recommendations from campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely success at this point that newspapers at present do not speak of Iraq as a whole.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, as he said, objectively speaking, he left his successor a much more favourable final situation than we could hope for.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will take place
Again, the campaign commanders asked for an increase in the military contingent, including the Afghan Operation Commander, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the reticences of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He asked 40,000 men to make the situation more favorable.
The President hesitated for three months, but in the absence of a better option, at least the general was recruited by 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to remove the promise of 5 000 additional on the part of Europe, even though it originally had 10,000.
What leads to the greatest problems in the whole Obama strategy seems to be its intention to remove the Afghan armies from 18 months ago and to complete all this process by three years. The whole Obama doctrine raises more questions than it does provide answers.
Many doubt that an increase in half will produce the same fruits as the growth in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the exact opposite - one cannot count on anyone and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, used to change leadership from day to day according to their arrangements.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will only remain the dust behind which will spread patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups, given the lack of clarity in relation to the reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "prompt state to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The temporary horizon of Obama's strategy makes it perplexing by its voluntaryism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only made it rain and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and beyond reality can be convinced that the small soldiers sent into the tumult of war for their "soon return to the house" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will consider it to be the indirect asset of the US defeat.
NATO's latest summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is directed towards the negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their voters what security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions have no impact on the Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult question of a solution to the problem by using the military force.
For example, it will have to be answered when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of the troops of Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will lead to a dramatic return to the Afghan situation.
The only rusty for Obama is that it remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore it remains long enough for him to plan on a new strategy, if it would prove to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank leaders won't receive any more cash premiums.
Top U.S. Goldman Sachs employees will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced it to respond to strong criticisms about its wage practices.
The group of 30 major leaders will receive actions instead of money, which they will not be able to resell before five years.
Actions may be withdrawn from the leaders if they take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus taking the lead in the effort to link earnings with long-term performances on Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the overall sense to take, indicated the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank has become the target of criticism after being put aside almost $17 billion for prizes in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $20 billion, despite the measure announced today, according to the Reuters agency.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the strong premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it had a single tax of 50 per cent on bankers' bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields outside physics
These are five women, a record number, who today received in Stockholm from the hands of the king of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prize in technical and literary disciplines.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry price was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonathan with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of the ribosoms
The last winner received the Nobel Prize for Economics, American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that has not been graduated this year was physical.
This prize has been awarded today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently based on all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each graduate has received the diploma, the Nobel Prize and the certificate of acquisition of the cash reward.
It reaches ten million Swedish crowns in each category. (about EUR 1.1 million)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward.
The very expected Nobel Peace Prize has already been handed over this afternoon to Oslo in Norway to American President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward because it was only at the beginning of his journey and that he was also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the time of his policy discharge, he added that in some situations the war was essential for peace, even though the price was high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Château
President Václav Klaus will receive the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who will stay with the government because of his disagreement with the State budget for the next year as voted by the House of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps the position of Janota in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their meeting on Friday.
Klaus also criticises the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which increases the public finances crisis.
It was President Radim Ochtat's spokesman who informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his function with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget legislation to be submitted to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
However, the House of Deputies validated the proposals on the left on money transfers on Wednesday and increased the salaries of officials, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government blamed the proposals of the democratic social partners for the fact that they were going to indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent dispute arose between the left of one side, the government, Klaus and the right of the other, which questioned the future of Fischer's firm, which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by the Members, removes the package of economic measures passed by the Fischer government and that it has to claim the debt of the State.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but which does not require it, said today during a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs that policies have long ignored the "serious problem" of the "refrisible deficit" of public finances.
Now there is, according to him, no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could improve, if it could rely on a consensus of the broader political parties, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek indicated that the budget is being made and that the government should challenge its subsequent existence.
The Vice-President of ODS Petr Necza told the CZK that the idea of an administrative office supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Verts does not function clearly anymore.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer has qualified such words as "drastic verdicts".
The head of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek responded to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is effective and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, ČSSD successfully ratified the State budget for next year.
The People ' s Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood Invictus film - Invaincu will show the world a lot of things about the country, its fights and its victories.
The story speaks of sport, relationships between races and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an American actor in the Oscars, incarnates the film on Nelson Mandela's life, which is tireless in fighting the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it's a 14-to-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate in the movie.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally..
The 60-year-old actor who was rewarded with a prize for his role in the Million Dollar Baby drama of Clint Eastwood located in the middle of the box has, for example, incarcerated the leader of a movement against slavery himself, a fictional president of the United States, even God in the film Evan All-Power, but never someone still alive and so important for so many people as Mandela.
The former South African Stateman was imprisoned for 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
It is an invincible Latin word and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of Nelson Mandela's joint efforts and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. President Mandela recently elected knows that his country remains and is always racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people by sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the foreigners in the world.
The South African team will make progress in World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring Mandela's story to the screen.
I had no other purpose than to play this role in order to bring it closer to reality," Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to dinner with him, to be in a hurry before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to close his hand.
I realized that when I closed my hand, I recovered from your energy, it passed and I had the impression to know how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the rough middle of the rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I dreamed at the door of the house, he opened up to me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the hood of the director Eastwood has received positive advice and is even spoken of ambitions for the Oscars.
The critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety newspaper summarized his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well realized film."
In film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com site, Invicus received 76 per cent of positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is resolved: the Russians were testing a rifle
A strange light phenomenon of unknown origin was observed above Norway.
The Russian Defence Department recognized only yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a failure and the "Bulava" missile, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, gradually became the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence during the shooting tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she got hurt in full flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "Misil that doesn't fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th test was normally carried out at the beginning.
It is only at the end of the flight that there have been further damage to the apparatus.
It is obviously the engine of the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the Dmitrij Donskij nuclear submarine that was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can just be fired by a moving and immersed vessel
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably a defective "Bulva".
In the rest, the Norwegians did not doubt that this was a Russian shooting.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two floors of the rifle were resistant and the vessel only touched the third.
In the previous cases, the engines have experienced failures on the first floor.
Although none of the tests were conducted without acceleration, the department's management considered that only six out of thirteen had failed.
This rate of success of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals of optimism and therefore they always claim that one day "Bulva" will fly without problems and that it will carry even ten hyssop nuclear cores of a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at 51
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will again appear in a 51-year-old professional match.
The former world champion, the Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will hand in hand to his team of the Moscow CSKA as needed and will make his likely entry during the match Friday against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who finished his career for forty years in 1998, is now the president of the CSK.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still need to settle some details about the form, says the coach of the Sergey Nyemtchinov club, quoted by AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will only concern one match.
I think that Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of the other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and obtained 15 goals and 26 aids.
Fettisov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and one of the most successful.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union, he dwindled gold twice in the Olympics, seven world championship titles, triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes in NHL where he twice held Stanley Cup.
He has been a member since 2001 of the Temple of the Renamed Hockey.
Hyundai listens to the unions and cancels all extra hours
The management of the plant Hyundai de Noshovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional hours.
It is precisely because of the frequent additional hours that trade unions have declared an emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesperson Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai factory confirmed it.
However, the management wants to continue to agree with the unions on a Saturday that worked this year again.
We can't give up our production plan, it's essential, that's why additional volunteer hours were proposed on Saturday 19 December, knowing there would be two teams, said Vaněk.
The site Sedmička.cz indicated that the company offered a 400 Czech crowns to the employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be awarded a poster for the day worked on 28 November.
According to Vaněk, the company has decided to change how to motivate its employees in exchange for additional hours.
Whether they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can put a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their end-of-year holidays to Vaněk.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transportation costs and lunch.
Given that additional hours were the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and claims of trade unions as workers who spontaneously stopped production last week, the management immediately decided to cancel all additional hours for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the employees of the car factory were forced to work almost every day for two additional hours in addition to their eight hours.
Trade unions intend to cancel the strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiations between the driving of the car and the trade unions must take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader Petr Kucharár said Wednesday that they were ready to end the strike if they agreed on their claims and signed a joint document.
The situation in the plant ended last Wednesday, when nearly 400 employees were spontaneously excavated due to additional hours incessant.
They also protested against the poor conditions of wages and alleged fines.
The management defended the fact that employees had to work in addition to filling the car production imperatives.
On Monday's announcement of the strike, trade unions also requested that no sanctions be imposed on workers who had ceased production.
Trade unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in additional hours to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a refund of 5,000 crowns (about € 209) for these.
The Hyundai car factory in Noshovice currently employs 2,000 people.
She started serial production last November.
It has manufactured approximately 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: a substance that works on HIV "permanent" also
A team of Czech and German scientists tests new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to medicines.
This reality, in some cases, takes over the fact that the combination does not act as intensively on the current variants of the virus as well as some medications already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present.
However, it is possible to radically prolong the life of patients through a combination of medicines that prevent the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption results in a series of secondary effects.
In addition, the suppression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what is called resistant viruses on which medicines are no longer affected.
The work of the experts of three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way for dealing with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalliccarbons act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metal carborans are a mixture of copper, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
Researchers' work leads them to discover new "improvements" substances based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their connections to the proteins of the virus.
Metalcarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-wall cages are formed by the atoms of copper, hydrogen and carbon and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus division caused by HIV protease, there would be no infectious mature particles of the virus.
If HIV prosthesis is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, explains researchers in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little lower but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in tests as well as in its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-contaminated patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metallic carborans is not as strong as on clinical medicinal products, however it does not weaken the resistant versions against which current medicinal products are often ineffective.
Therefore, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are interesting combinations to consider further to the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Rézačová, Director of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The ODS is taking over from Fischer, who is defending himself.
The President of the ODS (Democratic Civil Party), Mirek Topolánek, has qualified as the "ffarant" the ratified budget for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should challenge its existence.
The Prime Minister has qualified the ODS' statements of drastic verdict.
He says take time to analyze.
The spokesperson of ODS Petr Necza said that the idea of an administrative office supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Necza, the head of the government should decide to join the House of Deputies in supporting the minority who is concerned about combating the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned about remaining in his office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Necza warned that the positions of the ODS and the democratic social partners in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Deputies ratified the 2010 budget on Wednesday, however, with proposals for changes of 12 billion crowns included on the left.
The House has increased the money for employees' salaries, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government's complaint against the proposals of the democratic social partners was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the Government's wishes as if a modified budget was a less bad option than an interim budget.
Deception and inuselessness
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a feeling of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will still think about the current situation.
Necza is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave his post in case of ratification of the amendments proposals, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota met with the prime minister on Monday after his transfer to the government:
He indicated at the same time that he wondered if he would remain in his office.
Its disappointment over the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Necaj believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who have imposed the budget changes, do not have their seat in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifys other laws increasing the deficit, such as those affecting sickness insurance, retirement, or reform of the Service Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case of the head of the Fischer government and of the entire government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing harmful, said Topolánek in a textual statement from the United States.
He recalled that the vice-ministers of certain ministries were calling for TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Necza pointed out that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a struggle against the government deficit, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the majority of the left that is currently in the House."
This says, he must not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I didn't think about it, and once it's on the agenda, then I will dedicate myself to it, said from the House to journalists, the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, elected to the government just by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer called in in the afternoon for a debate by the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has taken a step back at the request of the Prime Minister.
Necza stressed at the same time that ODS would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not expressly asked the democratic MPs to allow the budget to vote.
We do not have the feeling of being orphans, we are not small children, have we responded to the question whether the ODS had received any complaints from the Chairman of the House Party or in the country during the budget negotiations?
I have not noticed that my vote would have failed.
I already knew at the time when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the months to come would be a Bolshevik of the House and a destruction of everything that was positive, Topolánek reacted in person.
According to the new ČD schedules, there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit from 13 December some less-charged express or regional trains and will strengthen some others.
The total coverage of transport will decrease on the date of entry into force of the new two-percent clocks compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic tariffs and reduced tariffs.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a branch of pendolino.
On the contrary, an express stopped serving Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport concerns the Hradec Králové region as a whole, in contrast to Prague and its surroundings, can be welcomed by an increase.
Two night trains on the line Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the circulation of some trains express on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will be reduced to only a few days a week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line by Milovice in Prague: for the time being, Milovice residents must change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esco's banner system, whose opening is possible due to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines towards the capital will have their final destination at the main station of Prague (Praha Hlavní nadraží).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Schumperk/Jesenník will start at intervals of two hours.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino until Bratislava from December 13th.
This year's invoice for regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year in all four billion crowns to regulate the visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the State will participate at the rate of almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, so far it has always been a year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not use an increase in the prices of the large majority of transport securities.
Changes will affect only the tickets of a day ČD Net and the eLiška low-priced internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The eLiška price will again depend on the route, while until then it was valid between cities of a region to choose and was at a single rate of 160 crowns.
The Philippine rebels are still holding over 50 people, children have been released
Today, the rebels have taken 75 people to the south of the Philippines, some of which are students from a primary school and their teachers.
It was the AFP that informed them, but it spoke of the origin of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the institutes.
The hostages took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 rebels were reported to have used hostages as human shields during a police escape.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the army branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first pursued the abusers following violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The death law was declared in the province of Maguindanao south of the Philippines due to a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre related to the Governor's administration elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of the Philippines of the South was arrested following suspicions of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential line of Ampatuan.
Mindanao also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, these have renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film comes to the American halls in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and tells a part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned apartheid fighter came back to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen by Mandela himself for years to incarnate him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was assigned to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the movie in the halls, the return of critics and the public is heard.
Nelson Mandela
From his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvesu in South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, then in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize next to Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is on one side in preparation for the World Cup of Football, and on the other because the media are agitated by worrying news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the people of the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, reactions to the new film are at the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations to the main roles where Hollywood stars are "painting".
However, Morgan Freeman is proud of the film, recognizing his own terms.
I've dreamed of this long-standing role and I've been well prepared.
I have also often personally met Nelson Mandela to be able - as we say - to recover from his energy, did he indicate at the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we have the chance to remember Mandela's personality and message through the film.
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but this concerns each individual has added.
Bringing the mail from the national rugby team
The film based on the history of the British writer John Carlin is freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave its creation to the people paints the South African defender of human rights during his mandate to the presidency.
Morgan Freeman is therefore trying during the film to collect two racial groups of a long divided population and Nelson Mandela in 1995 was among the members of the South African national team on the world's cutting hair, which South Africa had won at the time.
Mandela had been ovated for fourteen years, mainly from the white audience, and was recognized by the white people.
Let's hope that the football championship will be able to unite people again in one nation, said Rugby Chester Williams, who was the only "black" of the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the South African situation will improve.
However, South African whites are skeptical as recently entrusted to LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
A transformer with tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire struck in the morning a transformer from the company Čeps of the distribution centre near the municipality of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the firefighters spoke, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer consume, but they reviewed their opinion and set fire with a mixture of water, mussels and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one has been injured, and according to Pavla Mandátova's spokesman, the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the whole transmission.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure may be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatova, the transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
She added that in ten years of activity, Čeps knew nothing similar and that incidents of this type were isolated.
The electricity supply has not been interrupted, says the ČEZ spokesperson for the North Bohema Soňa Holingerova Hendrichova, the operation of households, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission sets and electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
He maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electricity from transport sets to distribution sets and lines of 4339 kilometres long.
Janchura will bring complaint for defamation against three prefects of the ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will now file a complaint for defamation against three democratic social prefects.
And specifically against Michal Haszek of the region of South Moravia, against Radko Martínka of the region of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tessarík.
Janchura indicated it in twenty minutes of Radio Journal.
The complaint relates to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions have concluded long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of us attacked and claimed that we were making the ends of our mouths, while we were only making an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways than what is not true because we know the prices of Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So we're only left to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander on the Student Agency, Janchura said in the Radio Journal.
It has also indicated that there is evidence that no region has done so in accordance with European law.
We are preparing for this a complaint for the European Commission.
Haszek believes that Mr. Janchura's complaint is the result of his media show, which serves him for free advertising for his society and for his person.
I am, of course, prepared to defend my name and the name of my region, and I call on the other advocates to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Haszek.
Janchura has already reported last week that he will invest a few million crowns in a publicity that will mention the unfavourable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiojrnal that he had interrupted the campaign after Christmas and that he was counting on to resume it after the New Year.
He stated that the campaign would aim at corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura started its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Railways to the operation of railways for a command of approximately 150 billion crowns, without calling for tenders.
According to Janchura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to threats from a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who he is, but I won't say his name, Janchura said today in Radiojrnal.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free of charge and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse the old habits from January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that will be paid for sickness insurance.
Experts are also clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated for free against pneumonia.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination was started last year or earlier, the following vaccinations will have to be paid on their own.
The first dose of the vaccine should be administered between the third and fifth months of the child.
Last year, about a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcals.
However, the parents paid 1600 crowns or more for a dose.
Vaccination of younger people requires four doses.
Experts believe that every year, sickness insurance costs 300 to 450,000 crowns per dose of vaccine.
However, they save on medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
So far, the State has spent about 500,000 crowns a year for the whole vaccination of children.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcals are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections including inflammation of the intestines and poisoning of the blood.
According to hospital surveys, up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age were caused by pneumonia.
In addition to the Czech Republic, approximately 40 other countries introduced the refunded vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on any future vaccination obligation.
From January, it must be regulated by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsky Association indicated that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted the vaccination against pneumococcals.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we had an optional vaccination.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it's a direction that we need to follow right now, said Kalovski.
However, the Department of Health does not want to modify the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are not considering it at all for the moment, he said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeně.
Optional vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Society of Paediatrics, recognizes that a voluntary vaccination based on its defects.
However, if all children were vaccinated, a reduction in the renewal of vaccinations could be considered "In the situation where the vaccine costs such an amount I understand the decision making the optional vaccination" says Cabrnochová.
Experts predict that as soon as the next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will be able to immunize their babies.
Pneumococcal vaccination also marks a break in the fact that it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not by the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thus saving on future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
However, this is linked to the concerns of the practitioners’ pediatricians, who are involved in the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to buy vaccines by insurance, doctors receiving them in the same way as the other vaccine products provided by the State.
However, some Members feared that this would allow insurance to "deduct the amounts of sickness insurance".
For example, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to refund them.
According to estimates, pediatricians will have to invest in each individual approximately 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is an important amount.
It'll be far from easy, according to Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Vol de muse"
Frank Frazetta's son, a well-known illustrator, was accused of trying to steal tables for a value of $20 million (GBP 12 million) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, the police reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been intercepted while loading 90 plates in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical skin to force the entrance of the museum to the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, aged 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan le Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Associated Press (AP) press agency.
AP quoted a police officer as saying that young Mr. Frazetta might have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52, claimed to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum by any means to transport the tables into a storage facility", the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior refused to grant such an authorization, the agency said.
The Labour Force advocates an increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the increase in the tax and reductions in the expenditure announced in the pre-Budget report, despite the criticisms of the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories stated that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that it was serious about reducing the deficit by deferring its decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted the furrows by attacking low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals, there is an increase of 0.5 per cent of Social Insurance and a 1% ceiling on public salaries from 2011.
The anger of Social Insurance
The unions protested that low wages were penalized by a recession that they were not responsible and warned that "problems" were being announced.
The reduction in social insurance - which will bring about GBP 3 billion per year - has caused the world of businesses to be angry, because it considers it a tax on jobs while the objective should be a recovery of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than 20,000 GBP a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
PRINCIPAL POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Insurance will increase still by 0.5% as of April 2011
The economy will drop even more than 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bank bonds
Increased tax on the profits of small companies has been abandoned
Discounts of electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions of 2.5 per cent
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning 30,000 GBP will lose 90 GBP per year and a person earning 40,000 GBP will lose 190 GBP, while a person earning 10,000 GBP per year will gain 110 GBP per year.
The ministers said that their goal of reducing the deficit by half before 2013 was "hard decisions" but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would be charged on the first 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of Treasury, rejected an increase in the tax and stressed that a decrease in expenditure was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important; they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential in the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said that he was confident and that economic growth would begin at the end of the year.
However, Labour forecasts on economic growth - which will influence the amount it will need to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be met - have been questioned after the Chancellor has been forced to revise its first figures.
In his speech, he stated that the economy would probably decrease by 4.75% this year - much worse than the decline of 3.5% predicted in April - while the loan would be 3 billion GDP above the preliminary estimate.
"Founded Opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch this Thursday a new advertising campaign warning against the "debt crisis" of the Labour, said that the project to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, have they added, "Cynically" against difficult choices until the elections - which must be held in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, chief secretary at the Treasury of the Office of the Ghost. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
" The important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Force stresses that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from further reductions, contrary to Tory's proposals, which would result in a faster and more significant reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems argued that the money collected by increasing taxes and reducing expenditure would be used to support the expenditures of next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "constructed on the wind".
Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, said that the advertising schedule - such as the increase in inflation for some disability benefits in April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor in the face of propaganda charges, and the money just recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Force stresses that additional assistance is being provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although the ministers had not published expenditure details beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that the restrictions on public spending would only begin to make sense in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Estudes Fiscales) stated that the number of Chancellors involved substantial reductions in many areas in the future, including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only reported," said his Director Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner," said Roger Bootle, Economic Adviser to Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been a false pre-budget report.
The FBI investigates "U.S. arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremism.
Men were arrested during a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the US Embassy announced in Pakistan, the BBC.
The FBI stated that it was investigating whether it was the same men who had been declared missing from their home in the United States of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said that it also sought information on these persons.
Three of them are presented as Pakistani descent, one Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are detained," said Ian Kelly, spokesperson.
Katherine Schweit, spokesperson for the FBI, stated that the agency had knowledge of the arrests and that it was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and if these are really students who are missing," she said.
Pakistan's Embassy in Washington said that men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of them's uncles.
She said that the house had already been monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the men arrested.
The Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused any comment on the arrests, reported the Reuters press agency, but stated that the United States should "cooperate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the continuing recruitment and training infrastructure of terrorism".
The five students had been taken away from their home by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuse"
Over the past 20 years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to the report of the Amnesty International Association.
the report presents "repeatations of violations" by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man mentioned in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its non-compliance with human rights.
The authorities have argued that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election led to the largest public demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
A dozen were sentenced to prison and prosecutors claimed that at least five people had been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a correspondent from BBC in Tehran, now in London, claims that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondent says.
"Failure confession"
Amnesty International reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ibrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Working with Facebook Networks' and protesting the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under the eyes, on the neck, at the head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still in blood and half conscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the missing candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities rejected the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuse had taken place.
Amnesty also quoted the case of a former prisoner who said he had been locked in a container with 75 other persons, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election disorders and the Government's response, but stated that the mandate and powers of these agencies were not clear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested during the last three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski trails built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to turn Bristol's site into a race track.
The Piste in the Park event (A track in the park) attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders in competition for cash prizes.
At the top of Brandon Hill Park trail, a small trampline preceded a 100m-long trail.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that the view of the top of the track was magnificent but that it was quite intimidating.
It is a beautiful view, with all the lights of the city shimmering in reverse.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prices have rewarded the best volts - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be left at the fountain.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French don't like the crowd" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr Bowen's last book presents a much broader and more ambitious line.
Good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in the mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what M. Bozen calls "Muslim space" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well how to listen to and reproduce discussions between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the womb (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use a banking system based on interests to obtain a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the everyday lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not lead the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr Bowen are generally in agreement with their lawyers from a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia who are today a small part of the Muslims in Europe.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the laity of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
It asks how much French politicians (and the guardian intellectual elite so virulent in laity) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not injured, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to compromise historically with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects a "treity of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say, "Yes, but not yet."
The darkest sight of the world
The Arctic changes faster and dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is sinking at an alarming speed, carrying with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipments and fishing are in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their village.
In "On a thin ice layer", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
A knowledge of the history and complicated policies of whale fishing, he described the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved them by chasing off the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then brave yearning for 14 years who had not to fight that the point of his mosque, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming by their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 hours at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are always a millionth of the surface needed for an adult in freedom. The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to the things that were growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis related the stories of other writers and historians and often referred to the threat posed by hunters to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Indians in motoski use powerful rifles to hunt their prey.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two nations of hunting that ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and clear summary of Arctic science and a glimpse of what the future might be there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Atmospheres and oceanographers cannot accurately relate the rate of change.
It's not necessary to try.
At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, Frittjof Nansen's pioneering trips provided the first information on the source of the iceberg.
The submarines of the cold war then mapped the change of relief under it.
Satellite surveillance and iceberg probes are of great help, but the biggest job is done by tough men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson looked at the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice tax system, formed by the seabeds of saltwater pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe it'll be our turn."
Marines, among the 6,000 people who filed crowns on the graves in Arlington
The first class of De'Angelo Robinson, 19 years old, took a seven-hour bus trip to deposit a simple crown on a soldier's grave that he had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
Within a few months, where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, Robinson said about the soldiers who fell.
If that happened to me, I'd like someone to do the same thing for me, that's why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers to be gathered on Saturday morning to deposit crowns on the tombs of the veterans, in various sections of the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
In 1992, Morril Worcester, owner of Worcester Wraith Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and other people decided to decorate several hundred graves in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make each year the trip, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other States.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of the cemetery of Arlington, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for the victims of the flight 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation provided more than $150 000 to buy and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, Westminster, said she had traveled to Arlington in honor of her husband, a retired career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who had sacrificed themselves.
It's a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Emmetouflée in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the palms and the extended hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers chose ancient graves, dating from World War I and World War II, as well as the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited as the new graves, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, while the children played and the couples held hands, carrying the cool pin crowns on the gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red papillo node on top.
Nearly there was silence in Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan were inhaled.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals would cry without hiding, other hosts and families and friends would stay in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others were looking to see the small black and white information cards, buried in the wet soil for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears on her son's grave.
She is part of Zanesfield, Ohio and had spent eight hours coming to gather on the grave of Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in July.
No one should ever forget about what we're free... my son paid for it, she told you.
"For a long time after I've disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
A U.S. citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested an American citizen who distributed mobile phones and portable computers in the country, claimed the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities, as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana, are trying to have access to the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writing, are at risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are married and are followed and harassed by government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but his authorizations have always been denied.
The detention of an American citizen may increase the tensions between the communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that continues a "sweet" approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward by concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, so that the United States can do so.
Mobile phones and portable computers are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country or the average salary of a staff member is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payday.
On the island, Internet use is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to join often have to communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the American rares imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, who is in charge of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information on the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- to distribute mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the American Human Rights Watch Group, who recently published a severe report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to Raul Castro's installation as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his sick older brother.
According to Vivanco, a defendant is often arrested, tried and imprisoned the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often reacted negatively to the United States, when the two countries began a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities reviewed an organization that was supposed to prepare a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US troops, saying that they hoped that this case would allow an important network of terrorists recruiting online for the search of radicalized young men.
The investigators claimed that they were chasing a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving terrorist waves on the YouTube video website.
Upon arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the retreated region of Pakistan's tribal belt, the al-Qaida home and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistani secret services who was informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida commanders that these men were not participating in the CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Thus, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the banned mountains of the north-east became a refuge for terrorism.
They were considered to be infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed itself on the condition that the anonymity was kept because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that men were determined and that they were always trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to gain entry into the al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are interrogated by the FBI -- emphasizes the crucial role of recruits in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in determining the people in whom they trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, US secret services have been given priority to infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruits play the role of barriers, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may have been spies.
According to analysts, potential American recruits are studied closely by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups should also be increasingly vigilant, in recent years when choosing people they accept because US secret services have become experts in terms of their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow his recruitment model than so many others have already followed?
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen demand a "action" for the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked the streets here on Saturday asking for more action on the part of the negotiators working in the Palace of the Bella Convention Center of the City.
The number of protesters was estimated to be 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit up some explosives near a set of government buildings in the city center.
On the day that little has happened in the discussions on the climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists went out of the city, deploying banners in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, declaring 'The Earth says it has enough.'
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to his mother's country of birth, Peru, opened her eyes to the problems that have to confront the country due to the impact of climate change that is already taking place."
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join in the big move -- to make the word go through and call on world leaders to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented demonstrators from coming too close to downtown Bella and said that she had arrested 19 people for wearing a mask or having pocket knives.
The police prevented demonstrators from coming too close to downtown Bella and said that she had arrested 19 people for wearing a mask or having pocket knives.
According to one who asked to keep the anonymity because of its involvement in climate discussions, activists wearing black masks and clothing lit several explosives near Copenhagen's main channel, which is surrounded by several ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first of all shootings, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congresses, people were gathered around television screens to follow the walk, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the demonstrators failed to raise the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, a representative of China for the climate.
When asked if he thought that an event would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "In fact, that is something I did not know.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring, "The event is important, I cannot hear what is going on outside."
He noted that the walk might seem harmful or useful from the perspectives.
It shows the interest of the general public and the various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal tensions between the races
Last week's federal report on the results in mathematics brought good news to the public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District is still far behind the headquarters, the report shows that Grades 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are far greater progress over the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of the Progress of Education) are the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and whites, on both local and national levels.
The average results of grade 4 white children (cm1) in WashingtonD.C. have increased in the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a 500-scale scale), but those of their African-American friends have only increased from three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in success has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, ranging from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Afro-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, with only one point, from 245 to 244.
The mean result of the blanks was not included in the test results as the sample was not important enough.
The overall view over a period of six years is no longer encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between grade 4 black and white (cm1), when the first NAEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results of children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was reduced to only 58 points.
Last week, some of the district's defenders expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the Education Group Director Michelle A. Rhee and the Maire, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were driven by white students who were already good.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in the education of the District.
I do not miss the joy of one or two winning points, said Kwame R. Brown (democratic apartment), member of the D.C. Council, and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary ( Elementary School).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said that the message of test results is that the city's middle schools (colleges) desperately need attention.
True, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect them.
But what scares us is that we don't devote enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at schools of the end classes of the elementary cycle and the start of college that did not integrate the basics of the reading earlier in their school course and are rather late for their friends.
Each day, the program of mathematics, for the classes of Kindergarten (Maternal) at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real life games and experiences, as they were established in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who should also be credited for the progress of NAEP reported last week.
I just think that we need to continue to work to offer better interventions to these students at a lower level than that of the class, Rhee said.
Others believe that the results of NAEP raise the question whether Rhee can continue to raise the system's overall results while providing the money and resources for schools with less good results to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at the University of Berkeley in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional policy solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest districts of Washington.
Thus, this target can have political implications that generate this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendents of schools, she tries to serve as the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a good school system.
We need to strengthen our district schools so that all families, wherever they come from, will be assured that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that one of the key elements to reducing the gap in success was the duration of the traditional public school, today 180 days in the Washington District, to compete with the Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, that he considered a "start point" to get another increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long sip.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, down and climbs a moment of eyes to the white columns, brick façades and green hairs.
Graciela's parents could only finish the high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Thus, while she and other grade 8 (4th) students of the group explored Gettysburg where the school costs are $38,690 a year, her attitude was less than that of a new, impressive student than an enthusiastic student.
Super This is where I'm going to study! Graciela exclaimed who would like to study medicine, while the guide directed them to the entrance of the science building.
You, really? she said dreamy, when she was told the low ratio of law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh to visit children during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this issue is still widespread for the large number of American children born to Spanish immigrant parents who have left high school where they have become parents at adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands of students who will be allowed to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a Hispanic of the "second generation" of five-for-five studies at the high school -- a remarkable success if it is considered that so many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without completing the high school.
Their success is important, researchers say, they open the way to the next generations that will play an important role in the country's work.
Researchers who study batants claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an inherent need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach the university -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, at any time, no intervention will help them, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a network of support to these children, from maternity to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit of the universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepared for you), it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize university preparatory programs that start when students from low-income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the programme has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent entering the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Ministry of Iraqi Oil gets agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has succeeded in attracting important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during the course of two polls that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Ministry of Oil in Iraq with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil industry in Iraq, which has been disabled by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies are divided into only two of the 10 field auctions.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only one who had put a stake in it was lost.
Two US companies were awarded contracts for field auctions in June.
The low representation of US oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, they are Asian and European companies that open the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, a website for information on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings, Tuesday, and political instability, while American military troops retreated, have stopped American oil companies, preventing them from becoming more forceful in Iraq, which has the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, analysts say.
In some cases, U.S. companies were disadvantaged because of their rivers, in particular the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhilips, who have maintained strong links with the Ministry of Iraqi Oil and have provided it with their technical advice, have distributed empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., held by the State, has entered into more contracts than other companies and is divided with important participations in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam jihad, spokesperson for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be equal to its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The companies selected to submit auctions made offers that were then compared to the rate per barrel that the department agreed to pay to justify production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida would have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile, having hit the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, declared on Friday US anti-spionage authorities.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second murder attack against one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car on Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed that the missiles had been fired by a pilot-free aircraft of the type used by the CIA, within the anarchy tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading to the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistani civilian secret services, speaking on the Miran Shah's phone.
The authorities stated that the suspect local militants rushed on the ground and quickly confiscated what remained of the "completely decomposed bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two anti-terrorism representatives of the United States provided unspecified evidence that Somalia was a part of the dead.
Somalia was described as one of the responsible al-Qaida military organizers who led the terrorist operations of the group outside Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wished to keep the anonymity, quoting the sensitive nature of air strikes within Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic guidelines of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the US authority said that Somalia had made rapid progress in the al-Qaida's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the great American public, but this does not reduce the threat he poses for us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second major character of al-Qaida or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalov, leader of a group of militants in the tribal zone, as well as three other operators.
The pace of the attacks by the CIA drones has decreased since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to the figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a web site moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability, while also disproportionately killing suspected informants, the site states.
UN special envoy to Kabul withdraws
The UN Special Envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a turbulent mandate with widespread allegations of corruption during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
Eide's departure takes place when Obama has decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said that he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would start in 18 months and which would force other Governments of NATO to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the good signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a Kabul phone interview.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international officials supporting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he did not resign, but that he would simply respect his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to United Nations representatives, Ban has already begun looking for a replacement.
The representatives claim that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been quoted; it is a citizen of Italo-Switzerland who recently presided over a United Nations mission to Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy Peter W. Galbraith, the accused in September, promoted President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and disproved the evidence of a massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he said that Galbraith's accusations -- which were thanked -- "have caused damage to the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism in respect of international election observation".
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of the United States forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the United Nations Directors authorize their successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than he had been assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money was spent.
Eide expressed her frustration about the limits of her powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy United Nations recruitment regulations were giving her opportunities to bring new talents.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must be subject to additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defence Robert M. Gates stated on Friday that the major world powers were about to impose "more important sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a 300-military march north of Iraq, during a week's visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramaticated the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a delay.
One of the things that weighs most on me is that if I learned something in Iraq over the last six years, it's the unpredictable side of the war.
The Obama administration considered a set of sanctions aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians on the street.
He said that "a set of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to convince the Iranian government that it would be in fact less safe with nuclear weapons" because "his people would suffer enormously" from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probably" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme in full compliance with the United Nations Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In Geneva's talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on reducing his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of his rich uranium storage, in exchange for fuel desperately necessary for a medical research reactor.
The administration has promoted such an agreement, by developing confidence on both sides and by making time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has appeared to have withdrawn from the attempt to agree - in part, the experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided by whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my opinion, Iran's redundancy against some of the proposals of the international community for which they had actually agreed at the beginning of October has encouraged the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to meet what they had not considered, in the course of further major sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set 31 December as a deadline for Iran to respond to proposals, before he turned to other options, including the continuation of what the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions".
In a statement made yesterday in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations stated what it called "unfounded allegations" of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington late Friday morning, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the plane for the rich Kurdish oil region to meet with the troop leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
There are persistent tensions between Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delay in the US plans to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wants to ease Kurdes' anxiety about the suspension. The US authorities have quoted Gates to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy in a unified Iraq".
We will not abandon you."
In ageing China, a change in direction
Wang Weijia and her husband surrounded them with propaganda shows, saying, "The Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "An extra baby, it's an extra grave."
They learned so well that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate of their city and by the ageing population, radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneously and firmly: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We have no second left, Wang said, 31 years old, Director of Human Resources and has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child's policy in China, creating two generations of unique children with well-known games and harps, named "the emperor's little ones", a crisis in the population threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell by 1.8 children per couple compared to six when policy was implemented.
Population distribution, while the number of residents aged 60 years and over is expected to explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the global average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a very educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Shanghai Municipal Population Commission and Family Planning) stated that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of work in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "so old - but not as rich, however - that developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" she said.
A gradual slowdown
The Chinese policy of the only child, drawn up in the constitution of the country in 1978, is, to date, unquestionably, the most controversial obligation imposed by the Communist government.
Couples who violate this policy are at risk of having enormous fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and of being discriminated against in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities assigned the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some authorities forced pregnant women from a second child to be abortioned.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to a ratio of boys - girls abnormally high.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually improved their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they adopted many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research, Beijing University, said that the central government authorities recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of detailed regulations that had the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorization.
The city's government has deployed family planning and volunteers to meet couples at their home, and to slide forwards at their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those wishing to have more than one child.
According to the family planning manager, the answer was disappointing.
Decorative response
Although those in charge of a rural town in Shanghai are saying that they have seen an increase in requests for couple files wishing to have a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five requests a month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, claim that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the municipality of Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason many people do not want to have any more children.
They want to have their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said that they would love two children and that they were legally allowed to have two children.
But like many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and the life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The West consider the policy of the only child to be a problem of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant for seven months from the first child of the couple.
True, we're stealing the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she only wanted a single child because she was one of them. "We were the center of the family and we had the habit of everyone taking care of us."
We don't have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, said this more carefully.
For couples working at two, middle-class, who reduce the rate of birth, he said, it must be selfish to succeed.
People aged 20 or 30 grew up seeing their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and do not want to have this lifestyle themselves, he said.
Even one child asks a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must leave at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child has only 9 months, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best maternity."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has plans for emission reduction
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations -- which has so far been characterized by unorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- has returned under the light of the Friday ramp, as a result of the publication of a document highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialised nations with most of the burden, in the next few years.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases highlighted the remaining obstacles, as long as it clarified the path to take.
But it has been seen as an important step in the negotiations that lack time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a special United Nations working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support climate warming, in the short term and in the long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including the way in which developed economies and emerging economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequitt, Representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who prepared six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General described on the climate change of the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, as "full image".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement whereby industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020 from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during the same period.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union has also resumed negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to sustain floods and droughts or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal alterations took place, which dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, United States Representative for Climate Negotiation, rejected any discussion requiring greenhouse gas reduction by industrialised countries, compared with voluntary efforts made by major emerging economies, if these were not financed by developed countries.
This change is the signal that Obama's administration is becoming harder to China than Bush's administration was, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not insist on ensuring that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese vice-minister of Foreign Affairs, He Yafei said that the US chief negotiator, either lacking "good sense", was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the United States would not help China financially to combat climate warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, defects have emerged both in the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States competing for their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting to know who should bear the cost of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major issuers responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, Ulate said, who is also the Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put pressure on obtaining a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that negotiations will lead to a minimum political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty proposal, early Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission's Climate Unit, said that small island States' action "has put political pressure on the complete political process", in part by their being now unified and asking emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The debate became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the problems in the process before the heads of government reached agreement.
High-level officials such as the Minister of the Indian Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister have come down from their plane and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend house-to-house meetings and briefings, in order to be able to make claims that will be studied during the following week.
The true image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palace of Congress every day -- guitar players present night performances that mock, betray, and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by e-mails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity only increases: almost all important ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the Grand Court, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the World Conservation Policy.
Heavy weights are coming.
In Britain, the first 225 km/h train will redefine Monday's syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. Monday morning, a sifflet blow will be lost at night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Great Britain.
The first high-speed train in the country will reach 225 km/h, while starting from Ashford, in Kent, London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on the first Javelin train outside London.
He hoped that the new service would enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and link the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland in London.
The small holes lost will become flourishing cities, the duration of business trips will be much less long and the passage of the plane and the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties adhered to this project.
But the ten billion books needed to build a new iron network, the inevitable planning battle and the fear of danger to the environment are at risk of slowing down the British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to make a feasibility report for the government, will report its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow you to get a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new London-West Midlands line will be drawn in the five metres of the urban area and sites where environmental impact may be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be designed up to 25 metres from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 has three options for a high-speed network, heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The privileged options are put forward in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will be separated in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch going west of the Pennines in Manchester and Scotland and another going north-east, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A unique line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When this is over, the time to travel between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel 400km/h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial track is designed to allow trains of 400m long and capable of transporting 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be enlarged to receive the high-speed network.
The experts in the rail industry said that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be forced to travel off high-speed lines on the trains that exist in northern Birmingham, preserving travel time between London and the higher Scotland for three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure a train passage, which is a reference point for the rail revolution.
The taxpayers repay the loan of GBP 75,000 for the Tory Orange
Alan Duncan, the main member of the Tory Parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of books a year to reimburse the cost of an orange that he built in his home of his constituency.
The party's responsibility that David Cameron was retrograded to complain that the members of the parliament were "maintained", increased his loan of GBP 75,000 to build a Chinese extension to his second house in Rutland.
It had been authorized to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The authorities of the Commons received complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Läg, who carried out a control of the members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan said the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of the parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in the district of Rutland - Melton.
The nearby homes were sold for nearly a million books.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the emulsion office says that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to explain for the increase in loans during a recent investigation by the Committee on Commons' Privileges and Standards regarding its prior loan arrangements.
The Committee has innocuously charged it last month with any non-compliance with the rules, following an inquiry into its expenditures.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan amended the legal security of his London ownership of 271,406 GBP in the house of his constituency he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of Parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately GBP 1,400 per month of interest on loans until March of last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were aimed at financing the loan of GBP 75,000.
The standard interest rate of variable RBS increased from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication of the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as Head of the ghost cabinet in September, after a journalist undercover filmed it saying that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the expense scandal.
"In fact, it's national now, you have to live "on the budget" and you've been treated as "of the m... and"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and I asked for a small part, based on what was right.
and I could have asked for more, but I didn't."
The member of Parliament, a millionaire since his former post as a oil negotiator, began to explain his expenses, in May, after it had appeared that he had requested thousands of books for his garden, before agreeing with the office of charges that this could "be regarded as excessive".
An activist crossed a £3 hole in M Duncan's hair to protest after it was revealed that he had requested £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in the loan, last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for capital improvements, both approved by the office of charge and then by Legge."
He added: "There is no problem with working or developing or using the rules or whatever.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn't be simpler or simpler."
Faithful, come all to Brighton's adventure calendar
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive adventure calendar.
Beyond, a group of the alternative church that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for every December day, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 17:30 to 18:30, every day, with pasta and hot wine served for free.
The Noel songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a 50-year-old TV assistant at Hove, is an unpaid minister of the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should approach people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the Avent calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experiment and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate
Tens of thousands of people protested on Saturday to seek an ambitious and binding agreement on combating climate warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where the police conducted several hundred interrogations.
At least 30 thousand people, according to the police, were shown in the cold in the Danish capital, on the side of the United Nations Conference on the Climate, to reach an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization of climate across the world, illustrated by these events, has contributed to making a very high failure "the political price" in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the court, when a group of 300 demonstrators, fully dressed in black, broke windows with strawberries and hammers, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-emergent police officers were immediately involved without a home.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to the members of "Blacks Blocs", these ultraviolent groups, which were illustrated, in particular, at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were called "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were always held in the street on Saturday night "mamented and maintained in position despite extreme cold".
Parliament's party, the court, rather a good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, a negotiating site.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the scheduled speakers, before a guard to the candles with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cap, Desmond Tutu.
Most demonstrators came in and out of large cities in Europe, but many Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, for the most part in waterproof blue sky, had formed a first meeting in the morning in Copenhagen on the call of the Earth's Friends, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we come down to the streets to ask for repair of environmental debt for the South, Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen explained.
We can't continue to say that we have time, the benique singer Angelique Kidjo has estimated.
There are rivers that dry in Africa, watercourses where we can walk like we've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alternative-worldist movement drew closer to environmental organizations.
The French Member José Bové, a figure of internationalism, explained that he had come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no need to cut between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, which covers many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had given the signal a blow.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had gone down the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for most of the time, were shown in red, with bananas that boasted solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, a few hundred protesters gathered to demand a vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva a few tens of people gathered.
Abkhazia separatist elected its president, Georgia denouncing a "farce"
Abkhazia elected her president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow's recognition of Georgia's pro-Russian separatist region, while Tbilisi denounced a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in this first vote after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 1700 GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to the members of the Abkhhaze Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on Saturday night.
The five high-ranking candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the vote.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili, "regrette that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia", said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considered it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After being separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which caused several thousand deaths, Abkhazia seeks to demonstrate through this election that she is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, has told the AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the electors who went to the poll office in a school in Soukhumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidency in this region in the rainy landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch next to the President and Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are installed in this small area of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, has reserved a warm welcome for Russian officials to monitor the election.
We, the people of Abkhazia, are grateful, during a small ceremony, in allusion to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered by raising a vodka glass.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the vote by former vice president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, like the one that gave Russia control over the railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims not to support the current power or opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: World events, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people went into the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the one hand, questioned nearly 700 people on the other side of an impressive event.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, showed in the cold the afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Parliament's party, the courts, generally good children, took the direction of the Bella Center, where negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped at about 500 metres from the center, without trying to enter.
A scene had been set up to welcome the scheduled speakers, before a guard to the candles with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cap, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the departure of the court, a group of several hundred demonstrators, fully dressed in black, munitions of brick and hammers, broke windows, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-emergent police officers immediately surrounded them and took action without a home, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the Black Blocs, these ultraviolent groups that were illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was wounded to death by a paw and four cars fired near a squad during incidents leading to the arrest of 20 people, according to the police.
We saw the extremist groups, who had prevented the police spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order were in the sky.
The majority of the protesters, who came in car and in the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, for the most part in waterproof blue sky, had formed a first meeting in the morning in Copenhagen on the call of the Earth's Friends, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we come down to the streets to ask for repair of environmental debt for the South, Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen explained.
We can't continue to say that we have time, the benique singer Angelique Kidjo has estimated.
There are rivers that dry in Africa, there are watercourses where we can walk when we've never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alternative-worldist movement drew closer to environmental organizations.
French Member José Bové, a figure of internationalism, told the AFP to come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cut-off between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Oxfam organization mobilized a number of personalities, including the Danish mannequin Helena Christensen, the former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who had to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which covers many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had given the signal a blow.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had gone down the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for most of the time, showed, dressed in red, and treed bandanas with solar energy in front of the capital of the Philippines.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, a few hundred protesters gathered to demand action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva a few tens of people gathered.
The geo-history is strengthened by the reform of the general lycée, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to appear in the JDD Sunday that history and geography were "strengthened" by the reform of the general school, despite the deletion of their compulsory education in a scientific terminal.
Now, the first students will have every four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the Minister, "you have to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S thread is no longer a scientific thread" but "in large, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L branches cannot remain a subsidiary of the S, he continues, stressing further: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals become angry about the absence of terminal history in technological lycées."
On Saturday, an Ifop survey published in the Humanity revealed that nearly seven French out of ten (69%) rejected the government's project to eliminate compulsory education of the history and geography in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers have also criticised this suppression, as well as the left and certain right-wing electorate.
On the other hand, the Minister added that it was not "no question" to delete the philosophy of the S terminal program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a Tuesday mobilization day to protest against the project, which they considered sacrificed the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will cover their discipline, then at the end of the year a admission test that will cover their teaching ability, the Minister explained.
They will also follow courses in situations during the year of M2 and will be a first year in front of students as trainees.
If you add all the courses proposed before the competition, you will already get more presence in front of the students, or more than 300 hours, has it continued.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the project to delete the school map "from 2012".
A Normal Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince you about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about issues of the Copenhagen Summit: it is the challenge that took place on Saturday morning Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC) invited by the Higher Normal School of Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize, opened the first of the Ernest conferences, a day consisting of a series of interviews by experts, 15 minutes each, filmed and open to the public, a journalist from the AFP.
We wanted to do something that captures people and gives them a desire to know more about it, explained in the margins of the Edouard Hanneso conference, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day who takes his name from the student to the fish at the school pool.
Twenty participants are selected from the experts of their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, has it been specified.
Regarding climate warming, "We can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without notes, but with the help of graphics, in front of fifty people.
This is part of our role as scientist, he stressed, hoping that the audiences will believe that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
Videos taken from these conferences will be posted on the school's website from 15 December.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled in February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Payment delays: anger of prison guards, planned actions
The prison supervisors' trade unions called Friday for "general mobilization" to demand the payment of additional prizes and hours by the end of the year for budgetary reasons.
FO penitentiary (2nd Supervisory Union) asked staff who would not be in service to appear on Tuesday morning in front of prison facilities and to "block them" to "denominate the flight of their dunes".
The CGT penitentiary (3rd trade union) calls for "to meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", judging as "hot and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "additional hours, night prizes, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first supervisory union, the federal autonomous penitentiary union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Department of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that the additional hours have increased considerably in 2009 and have not all been budgeted, but ensure that the remainder will be paid in January.
The Chancellor stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent an e-mail to the supervisors' unions to ensure that this payment would be made next month.
I do not ignore the efforts made by staff to operate and modernise our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I asked the management of the prison administration to put in place a set of measures without delay to ensure that this situation caused by a poor assessment of the number of additional hours does not reproduce in the future, added Ms. Alliot-Marie.
Thus, the December pay will be increased, except for management staff who receive the famed primary functions and objectives, has deplored Ufap/Unsa, for which "budgetary constraints have a good back".
It is a pure scandal, the interregional FO union of Marseilles, announcing its decision to boycott up to the new order "all meetings and convenings".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those in October are not regularized in December, the idea for additional hours, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the time when our tasks and missions are increased without increasing our staff, it is more than regretful to wear them to the staff's money, the CGT penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less distant than others.
However, there is no account, the Secretary-General of Ufap, Jean-François Forget, noted.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer "sweeter tricks" than those he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas family at the White House, has entrusted to the "father" screen of the little Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple gift rule: "I give things better than the things I receive."
As part of a special issue that will be broadcast on Sunday night on the ABC channel, the president and his wife Michelle offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious stay.
Even Bo, the little four-legged partner of the family will be on the side.
Father Noël also loves Bo, so said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would have a "surely" gift, according to the results of the release released in advance.
And Michelle Obama mistakenly wrote against her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he received: "Of course not, I offered you some nice gifts last year," she touched the president.
Absolutely, was it obliged to give before humour refilling the First Lady's pearl necklace with the finger: "Who offered you this?".
During this one hour's broadcast, in the relaxed atmosphere, with the famous cheerleader who was a firm supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama spoke of a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his father kenyan had rarely seen offered him in Christmas.
I remember this time I met my father who came to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a basketball, said the president.
It's only later in my life that I realized it was him who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I didn't really know how to organize a house, so I aligned all the furniture against the wall rather than set them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reworked, RTL asserts that he is in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was reoperated in Los Angeles due to significant "healings" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to its surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reopened on Wednesday night to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after American physicians had found "the resulting injuries of the operation" of the discale hernie followed in Paris on 26 November, reported in Paris his press service, stating that these injuries had "needed a repair operation".
The singer's press service, however, wanted to reassure itself that the situation was "controlled", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be communicated no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the last singer tour, however, Johnny Hallyday would have been thrown into an artificial coma to avoid "pangs and complications".
It's only in 48 hours that we'll have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens his eye, adds RTL.
Questioned by the AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to certain sources" no drain would have been placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of the Monceau Park for this discal hernie.
The intervention, programmed for several days, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
This was not available on Thursday night to comment on RTL information.
Following his surgery on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles for a subsequent infection.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, estimated Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but made sure he didn't "any interest" in the rocker, which is "a fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was a connery because 12 hours after such an operation, it's not playful, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to reassure himself, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacted in a satisfactory way to antibiotics" and that the infection was "endured".
Mr. Camus had also said that he had stayed with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer's health problems have only increased since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a crash on his yacht.
Two months later, in the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated with a "small colon cancer", then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer repeated his "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been well-recorded. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the singer to move on stage.
In mid-November, his surroundings even had to neglect a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small bassin: the first of Bousquet's on its fetish distance
Frances Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalized at the World Cup 2009 in large pool, declared on Thursday an international title on a particularly long distance, the 50 m free swim, during the Euro–2009 in small pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where the combinations are allowed for the last time has only seen three records of the world beatus while waiting for a disparagement.
One has been improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto with 200 m 4 knots and the other two by Russia in 4x50 m 4 knots.
A regret for Bousquet, who was looking for the record of the 50 m free world, which he held in large bassin (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of the swimming, the 50 m free, is the 28-year-old French who was imposed in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took off against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet advanced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had considered.
We can always dream better, and at the same time, I said that if the world's memory was at my disposal, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
At the beginning of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their era in Istanbul, which had received the first in 1999, at the same competition.
The use of combinations did not serve this time in German Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in the big pool this summer in Rome, records of the world at the key.
The young swimmer has failed to lower the mark that he holds on 400 m free swim (3:32.77) but has nevertheless been forced by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), in front of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up on this race.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola plus 1.5 million USD
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to the French writer Emile Zola was added on Thursday $1.5 million, clearly above his estimate, announced the art merchant Sotheby's.
This two-metre panel was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000, from the third century after Jesus Christ.
The marble "representing four dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decoration, surrounded by satires and baccantes, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," explained at the AFP Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice president of the art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's.
It was sold in a hundred batches.
The sale is still in progress, but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have been most interested so far, told the AFP a spokesperson of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained close to 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, and subsequently appeared with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it a part of his bathroom in his private Parisian hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic of France and briefly President of the Council prior to the accession to the power of Marechal Petin.
It remained a shadow zone of about fifty years.
By exploring the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Eile Zola success" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Therèse Raquin" and the freshness of the "Rougon-Macquart".
An abortion attempt from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico considered that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer on its territory of the demise President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who had refused to follow a different course by the Putschist government.
For the time being, after a telephone conversation in the evening with President Zelaya, it appears that the possibilities for this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
He arrived in Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government's plane departed to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
The Putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "demission" and to ask for political asylum abroad to grant him a free conduct.
But the deputed president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as the head of the State in practice.
The pitschist government "has experienced a new failure in wanting me to give up my duties (...), they wanted me to resign," said Thursday Mr. Zelaya on the Globo radio, on which he often expresses himself since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the country of Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing a few deals with the president, who has been a refugee in the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico has presented us with a request for extra-conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain asylum, the Minister of the Interior of the Putschist Government, Oscar Raul Matute, said on Wednesday, on the Honduras radio HRN.
I did not ask for asylum in any country, I had answered Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur chain, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras would have to become the President of the Honduras people, he had stressed.
Mr. Zelaya's departure rumors had mobilized on Wednesday the members of the deputed president, who had come to gather around the Brazilian Embassy, where the military had strengthened their seat.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government with regard to international standards, he felt.
Zelaya, who had approached the Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been reversed on 28 June, the day he held a popular consultation to prepare his election against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on 21 September and took refuge in the Brazilian Embassy.
If he succeeds, he will be arrested to respond to the crime of "high treason" to which he is accused of justice, according to the Putschist government.
Pupschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial vote recognized by the United States but challenged by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress massed against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street mounts, the US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday, the figures of the US trade balance testifying to the resumption of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced from 68.78 points to 10,405,83 points, and Nasdaq, a technologically dominant, from 7,13 points to 2,190,06 points.
The standard & Poor's 500 extended index has been adjusted to 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1.102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza, of the FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, has it temperamented, considering that the market focused on "the half full glass".
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures of the US trade balance, "which show that the activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The trade deficit in the United States fell by 7.6 per cent in October compared with September to $32.9 billion.
The analysts were looking forward to an increase in the deficit.
Imports that exports have also increased.
The big news is the growth of trade volumes, especially for exports of goods, which reflects the growth of economies of the major trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new employment registrations in the United States have increased against any expectations last week, reaching 474,000 applications.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new jobseekers "has fallen to the lowest in a year", said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year-old Treasury return rose to 3,482 per cent against 3,423% on Tuesday night and to 4,492 per cent against 4,408 per cent on Wednesday night.
Cuba: hundreds of power supporters make the "White Ladies"
A few hundred members of the Cuban government were concurred on Thursday of the political prisoners' wives gathered in Havana for the World Day of Human Rights, and prevented another event for which tens of dissidents were intertwined.
A quarter of "White Women", wives or close to political prisoners, were taken to the streets by Raul Castro's government supporters as they marched to the capital centre to claim the release of political prisoners, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Down the Yankees!, "mercenes!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" were blackmailing, the raised point, the partisans of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who came to "insure their protection".
The guard, a similar event had taken place against the "White Ladies" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also learning to manifest themselves on Thursday for the International Day of Human Rights were, intertwined by police officers in civilian areas, found an AFP journalist.
Policemen have forced the dissidents into civilian vehicles that have been confiscated by government supporters, according to this journalist.
Disposals in similar circumstances generally last only a few hours.
European Parliament Prize winners Sakharov 2005, "White Ladies" had organised an unauthorized march "to demand the release of all political prisoners", in the number of 200 according to the dissident, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Mr. Maceda was part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remained under the spells.
The Cuban authorities consider opponents as "mercenes" or "agents" to be the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
In short, Cuban television reported on the demonstration of Thursdays of pro-government militants against counter-revolutionarys.
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
A forced killer kills an octogenaire at the knife and makes 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An armed couple of knives killed an octogenaire and injured five others in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of influence, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker would have hit with two knives and for an indefinite reason, an octogenaire, in or in front of a 85-year-old boulevard, was learned from police sources and witnesses.
Griefly injured, the old man, born in 1929 under the responsibility of the Alliance police union, died at the hospital following his injuries.
In or before this same drug, he then took it to a couple whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, aged 30, got involved and was injured.
The first two victims, severely injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenaire collapsed.
The days of the other injured are in danger, and vital organs are apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then made a malaise and would have been hospitalized "in a state of shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the guise of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then run away in the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have injured two passersbys, apparently by chance: a thirty-one and a forty-one, the last cry.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two mouthpieces that he wore in the cross behind his back, explained on the spot a head of the Alliance union in the Uppers-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, according to the evidence collected by the AFP, attempted to control the force.
I've seen a guy in his 30s with a green dress.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was expensive, said Alberto, the server of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his arm, he added.
Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal policemen, whose responsibility they were, tried to implode the armed man and were wounded at a ping, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passers came to tell me there was someone injured outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very important damage to the abdomen, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later a second person of thirty years arrived, injured by knife.
These are national police officers who arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Parquet seized the Departmental Judicial Police Service of the High-De-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The officer was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard within the framework of his guard.
A police source has not excluded him from being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, he needed six police officers to control Clichy's police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of exhilaration" as "all the forces of this species whose forces decompose under the influence of the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again claims to abandon the prosecution
Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski's lawyer called for a new Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), abandoning proceedings against his client, currently assigned to reside in Switzerland for a case of deaths over 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", denounced three judges of the California Second District Appeal Court of serious procedural errors at the time of the facts in 1977.
I call for the discharge of the charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "has been cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- deceased since -- would have discussed, before making his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious procedural failure.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wished and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally said at the end of September that he had lied to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court would refuse to give up the prosecution, Mr Hummel claimed the holding of a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no discharge of the charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski would appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, prior to his sentence, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
He's never been on foot in the United States since.
The Deputy Prosecutor of the County of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, thus stated that Roman Polanski "should be here to present himself to the audience."
In this case, we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused people, that it is possible to leave?, Mrs. Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "requests favor to the court, while contempting her authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed that "there were other alternatives to escape".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for abandonment of persecution against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, the end of the prosecutions.
Recalling that his client no longer has to be harassed for each rebonding of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was just.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was assigned to residence in his Gstaad cabin, waiting for any extradition.
Wall Street ends with no direction, suspended by the increase of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended with no direction on Friday, in a market driven between better indicators than expected in the United States and the increase in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63% but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is mounted from 65.67 points to 10,471,50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technologically dominant, left 0.55 points to 2,190,31 points.
The standard & Poor's 500 expanded index from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, Mace Blackxilver, from Marblehead Asset Management, noted.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think that will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend has been supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which "have helped to improve the market's view of the robustness of economic recovery", analysts from Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month of the show and much more than expected.
The confidence of American consumers was also clearly restored in December, at 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices have been halted by a new growth of the dollar, at the top of two months in front of the euro, which "has pushed down the sectors that are sensitive to the economic situation", said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values thus lost the ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury's return rose to 3.540 per cent against 3,482 per cent on Wednesday night and 30-year-old to 4,497 per cent against 4,492 per cent on Wednesday night.
Miss World Election Again in South Africa
After a month of isolation across South Africa, the 112 candidates as Miss Monde are ready to break the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion TV viewers.
During this great mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already disembarked their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were chosen Sports Miss or Miss top model during their African stay.
That was a real tourbillon.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and the Cap was amazing.
I've seen so many things and I've had so many experiences!
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, has been broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15H00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to restore my crown.
This experience has been fascinating.
I'm happy to have lived it twice, says Miss Monde Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the Australian summer.
For young Russians, her second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with candidates and the rediscovery of "landscapes to cut the blow in this country".
After a month of galas, repetitions, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss now focuses on the competition.
The Indian Poja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and presents this election, as well as those of Ashwarya Rai in 1994, both becoming Bollywood stars.
It is the dream of every woman to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it is nothing but the appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our country and I want to go home with the crown, launch Miss India with a wide smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will score this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional and, of course, in bathrobes.
The show will be animated by a TV shower, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a committee manager Miss Monde Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it was able to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is difficult to equal, assure Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visited Soweto's famous township, but this time on bicycle, and enjoyed the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met South African President Jacob Zuma, who closed their hands.
Not running for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will no doubt remain the draw to the Cape (Southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to promote a little more event.
I've been with people I never thought I could get close.
I'm sure I'll come back for the World-2010, excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive", according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive", assured his son David on Friday at Los Angeles airport, where he had to go to his father's head hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong, it happens very well, told the press David Hallyday at his departure from the plane that took him to Paris shortly after 1300 locals (21H00 GMT).
The son of the singer, the retired air, assured him that he was going to go to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a subsequent infection to the operation of a discale hernie on November 26th in Paris.
The singer was "put in artificial coma this night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and being able to administer his treatment," the press service reported.
Johnny Hallyday had already been put in artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for an infection resulting from the operation of a discale hernie on 26 November in Paris.
The singer had to be reopened on Wednesday night to Thursday due to major injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where their daughter Jade, to attend a school show, found a photographer from the AFP.
The head of orthopedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would return to Los Angeles on Monday with the singer.
The producer has violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November at the International Clinic of the Monceau Park in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were upset, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about a possible judicial procedure to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus felt that Johnny Hallyday was "too fast to go to Los Angeles, with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this on-line doctor who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and that was stupid, since I had myself two Discalhernies, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "drain-free, nothing" after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajaux is very well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before his death in a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he also performed by Actor Charlotte Gainsbourg to reassess a hematoma following a brain haemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor of sulphurous reputation, convicted on several occasions by justice, in medical cases, as well as for fiscal fraud and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the attorney of the Medical Order, accused him of being "a man without scruples" to pursue "regularly" before the Council of Order, and who is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself on Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention was "perfectly well done" and that post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require a drain," he added.
In any event, the singer's turn, whose health problems have increased since this summer, seems to be between parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8th (in Amiens, etc.) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF Association raises the tone and sum the New Centre to no longer use its seal
The UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem, reacted on Friday to the OPA's attempt by the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the seal of the former giscardian party, putting it in place to no longer use it on any ground, without prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF seal, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after holding his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP passed to the NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand to have been the first to deposit it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the UDF office, controlled by friends from François Bayrou who do not intend to settle down, came out of silence to launch a stay with the minister and the MP, summarizing that they no longer use the seal and pass on the brand's property, without judicial prosecution.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the statements indicating that you are going to propose to your political movement of +repere+ the UDF seal, write the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centralist Alliance.
You also believe it is good to follow on your militant equipment and on your website's watch page, the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, the slogan + the UDF today+, also detects the signatories of the mail.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this mark, explains the UDF office that keeps the NC to remove "the name of the UDF from any medium and from (its) website immediately".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transmit the property of (la) mark to its legitimate rightholders".
If you didn't, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF supporters, the signatories prevent.
In their e-mail, they state that the UDF "is a full political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "choose" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right, according to them, to use the UDF seal (Union for French democracy).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 for its membership in MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
With regard to Hervé de Charette, he continued the office, "when he filed the mark", he was "no longer acceding to the UDF for three years", but to the UMP.
It is scandalously and fraudulently benefiting from the absence of the UDF acronym deposit to carry out it for its own account.
This indelicacy is becoming a crime, condemning them, before ironing on the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for itself than to try to get out of the anonymity by taking a name that we are not entitled to."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as he was accused of by billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he benefited from a state of weakness of the octogenaire for the spoiling of a part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photographs of stars, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a fine of a maximum of three years imprisonment and EUR 375,000 fine.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which the mother and daughter are divorced while holding the remains of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, 87-year-old, should be conducted jointly by three doctors.
L'Oréal's main asset and shareholder has always refused to submit to such a review, in any case under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Park during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will be required to report before 10 March 2010 including whether Liliane Bettencourt was in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think she'll submit.
I'm going to talk to him about it, he told Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman at the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is an excellent new one (...) The expert will demonstrate that he (Mr. Banier) has manipulated this old lady that we need to protect, has he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has been prosecuted in prison against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and touch-and-touch artist, who has been accused of having benefited for years from her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros of gifts, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master's tables.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by the photographer, which she considers to be a long-standing friend.
While the court was required to examine the admissibility of the action undertaken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers' complaints sometimes turned to the large family decommissioning on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was making fun of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the email dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to him since his marriage."
For her part, Nanterre's prosecution again considered that the complainant was not acceptable to act, since more than a court of law has refused these last days to grant her the right to open a court-martial procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has the full capacity to act in justice, she is not protected and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said the public ministry representative Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would be decided once the trial had taken place on Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers's admissibility.
Management revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the great French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been futile...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large enterprises for the purpose of its employees reminds us of the position of consumers for the purposes of the marketing revolution: it is to make employees adhere to "values" determined above, as it used to be, to impose on consumers the products thought of by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put market conquest strategies in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose disconnected products from customer preferences factors returns regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demobilization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects in particular the frameworks.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all the company's intellectual functions, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE "needs a proactive approach and a prospective vision from all stakeholders (...) and requires a commitment on the part of employees that the revenue of management is totally inconsistent.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put employees at the centre of the company's concerns to the same degree as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Internal opinion surveys – how the questionnaire submitted by Orange to his employees – will they encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I have found that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally comes, after many detours, to do what it has always done.
- Then, because of authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic vision of human behavior.
From major engineering schools, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, through intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the United States and widely disseminated "neurosciences" by the study institutes and the media.
Thus, suggesting that the "leviers" (sic) of the commitment of the framers are possible, a recent investigation of Ipsos in Le Figaro.fr comforts the leaders in a position of mechanical governance, not adapted to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises is intended to adopt a finalist vision of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental statement: for employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears to be a means of achieving part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from the Motivation Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they judge their business by based on a predefined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, corporate leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and return their human resources management "to the place".
They thus create an area conducive to a concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: the "just war" is worth praise to the right in Obama
The U.S. Right welcomed the speech delivered on Friday in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives, who had awarded Mr. Obama the award on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, a former candidate for the vice-president during the 2008 elections.
I loved what he said, said Mrs. Palin, the leader of the right wing of the Republican Party, to the daily USA Today, adding that she has addressed the theme of the war itself "sometimes necessary" in her memories that have just been published.
The war is of course the last thing in my opinion that Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop these terrorists all over the place, she thought.
Mr. Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, used Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really good, and congratulated the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech.
On the other hand, I found this all-historical speech, said Mr. Gingrich, interrogated at the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected, considered by some as a potential candidate for the 2012 presidential election, said it was pleased to see "a left-wing president" recalling members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not give a prize of peace if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, George W. Bush's former plumbing chronicler at Washington Post, Mr. Obama said "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting themselves as "citizen of the world" as "he always does," "he spoke as an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it," said Mr. Gerson.
Among the rare to the right not to be convinced, a Bush-era faucon, former United Nations ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "black, ampoule and without inspiration" on the National Review Online site.
At the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When the war is wrapped in the notion of justice, it can easily justify the massacre of innocents, has it been warned.
However, the press of the gauche centre remained commendable at the president's place.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize had been given to Mr. Obama in advance, qualified his speech as "superproduction" even for a well-known speaker for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", the California daily burned down.
Mr. Obama "declared the speech he needed," said the New York Times, judging him as "both shady and building".
Routes: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three negotiations-marathon meetings, road trade unions and TLF, the only employers' organization to remain until the end of the day, reached an agreement on Friday night, ending the word of strike and the threat of Christmas supplies.
At the signing meeting on Friday night, the State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" of this agreement, after several negotiations, began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to sign the text of the agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And the same if three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTHER) had locked the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting beginning at 11 a.m. to get everyone to agree and to sign the text at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very harmful to businesses" and "was to be afraid that it would have disturbed the end-of-year parties," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase in salaries of 4% for the lowest (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
At the hourly rate, for low wages, "it's from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
It's not a big deal, but we're far away, Patrick Clos (FO) explained.
Either we're going to order our militants that there are no locks, no locks in the recovery centres.
But we can always have some recalculators that are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", even though it was "hard to grant increases on high wages in view of international competition".
According to him, increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of good sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the revalidation of the travel costs of 3%, and the maintenance of the general condition of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will, inter alia, address the issue of a 13th month and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in the employer's charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending financial law for 2009, voted on Thursday night to Friday by the National Assembly.
The Government will ask the Senate to vote "in an identical manner".
The Tlf signature allows the agreement to apply for the first time to companies associated with this organization, and for the second time, to all professions, in the case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will become "as soon as possible", said Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a " ash market", as the 100 million euros "have already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to contradict the food of the next wake, Unostra said.
For the other, the agreement is "to increase the fall of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this weekend, dissatisfaction unions of RATP proposals
The disturbances on RER A, the largest urban transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday to the 2nd day of strike between the RATP unions and management left them hungry for their premium demand.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchases before Christmas, there will only be trains between 10 a.m. and 20 a.m., due to a train on two over the central section (between the Defence and Nation) and a train on four outside the central section.
Interconnecting with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Gallery, which awaits 200,000 customers every day, is pleased that "RATP makes efforts to serve the largest shops".
The APR across the west is the Parisian agglomeration.
The short RATP section of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains circled at the point hours, and almost no branch within hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no cohue on which the French were organized.
Thus in the early morning, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station was much less frequent than usual, particularly because of the absence of colleges and colleges.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen "a thirty-hour earlier, to be sure to arrive at the time".
The Saint-Lazare Station did not know of saturation, said the SNCF, which had planned a framework for agents and forces of the order.
The RERs operated by the SNCF from or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
New general meetings of strikers will take place on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, judged "major" by trade unions, from a meeting with the management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of R & D proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for R & D on all aspects, working time, career, etc.
This is not what drivers want, which claims a prize due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even put its proposals as a bonus between parentheses, angered the CGT, stressing that the management "was not able to solve a problem while at the roads and the SNCF it was done".
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "a broader review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession", RATP specified.
What also told the trade unions that the company "smoothed users of the weekend".
In the morning, some 150 drivers invaded a headquarters committee in Paris.
It was then that the management, who had thus far refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested that the meeting "in the interest of accommodation".
The conflict threatens to expand to RER B on Tuesday, following the submission of a warning by Unsa and Independents.
Trade unions apply for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, 30 of which are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the daily millions of travellers.
The RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, reach from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros in prizes, for discounted hours, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurdish party, hard decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court pronounced on Friday the dissolution of the main pro-Kurdish party of the country, a decision that was immediately followed by anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision is likely to complicate the government's task, which has just stretched its hand to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become a "house of activities harmful to the independence of the State and its indivisible unit", the President of Court Hasim Kiliç said in the press at the end of four days of deliberations.
The decision was unanimously taken by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes were required to pronounce the dissolution, said Mr. Kilic, adding that 37 of the party's officers, including President Ahmet Türk and MEP Aysel Tugluk, are political life-banging for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity to which Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk were entitled and the confiscation by the Treasury of the Party's property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that the Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that it has no "organic links" with the PKK but refuses to qualify as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the Court comes when the government has just stretched its hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, in order to try to draw Kurds' support to the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP leaders had argued that a dissolution could lead to a re-creating of tensions in the South-East Anatolian, where numerous protests against the conditions of detention of the PKK Chief Abdullah Öcalan have been degenerated in hard times with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great city of the south-east populous majority of Kurdes.
The order forces pulled tearogens and used water cannons, while demonstrators launched molotov cocktails or stones, with springs.
A hundred people have also shown up in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the Court's decision would "increas the despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, etc.) by banning a party, has it declared to the press.
The Government, formed by a party from the Islamic movement, also deplored the decision.
We are, in principle, opposed to the closure of the parties.
That does not solve anything, said Taner Yildiz Minister of Energy.
This decision is a total waste of the government's democratic opening, the political analyst Ahmet Insel commented.
Of course, we can expect a response from the PKK to be added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very strict winter.
But the responsibility of the road derailment and sanding service (FES) is very clear that it is not to mislead citizens.
It's just so that agents can test vehicle technology and learn to control them well.
And according to the meteorologists, it could be good for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to attack snow and glass.
The ESF follows a very well-developed plan.
Mr. Brauburger explained that as soon as he turned his back on the city of Frankfurt and that the temperatures were falling below zero, large sand vehicles were travelling 20 main routes (named itineraries A).
This includes high traffic streets, major arteries, such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
It also includes firefighting, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and pedestrian streets such as Atzelbergstraße.
FES agents start their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be salted with a road floor that fits well within 3 hours of maximum time.
That's why the FES service starts at 3:00 a.m. "to get the roads off when daily migration traffic begins."
When snow falls at 7:30 a.m.
This poses problems, he tells us that the road derailment and sanding service is responsible for "because no car driver is willing to let the salad vehicles pass".
Then, if he doesn't snow anymore, we take care of access roads and dessert routes - like Rat-Beil-Strasse.
Secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger well knows that this is always the case with a few complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES Pedestrian team is on its way to get out of the dangerous areas and passage.
With regard to cyclable tracks, FES services are generally unable to deal with it.
Mr. Brauburger said that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the state of the bridges between 22 and 430 hours.
As the glass forms very quickly on these surfaces, the salad vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
There is also a need for police to use this special service.
The Tree of dinosaurs
The Hallae Tawa resembled other carnivores: this bipede would measure about 2 meters long for 1.50 m high, its lateral members were powerful, its long skull was provided with acreted and curved teeth, its short arms ended with facilitious grips and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, like the report Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues in the magazine Science of Thursday, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs to have these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which made it the part of the land that emerged from the supercontinent, the Pangée and was on the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the bright Tawa of a new day is the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
In fact, it teaches us about parenting, distribution and characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt carried out searches with other palontologists on the Gohst Ranch site north of New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History of Utah and a member of the team of excavations reports that they sometimes found a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists soon realized that some of these habitats belonged to a new species.
The remains of five specimens have been updated.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers baptized him from the name of Tawa according to the word of the Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: the dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to some incomplete bone fragments.
All paleontology experts do not share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he states that it confirms certain theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth some 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify all the first dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, at the time when Saudis were divided into three major groups of evolution: thetropods (carnivores) that include the later tironosaur and the cyclist and which descend the birds, the sauropods, the quadrupeds on the long tail, and those related to them and the herbivores of ornithischies that are part of the species such as the triretops and the stegosaure.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first therapists.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers have found indications that the Tawa hallae had small air bags in its bones at the skull level, as well as the birds that are descendants of the therpods.
These small air pockets facilitate the breathing of birds compared to mammals.
It seems that at the Tawa hallae, the vertebraes were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest therapists to have small air bags in its bones.
As the related line of huge sauropods also had air bags and a light body, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive migration waves to North America.
As the earliest known dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers concluded that the Saudis were there.
As a result, the three major lines of evolution have been divided and split from South America to the rest of the world, that is to say all the emerging lands that formed the Pangea supercontinent.
This appears to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists has also discovered the remains of two other theologians that are not particularly related to them.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, advancing the researchers.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History of New York and co-author of the magazine Science Studies says there would have been at least three migration waves to North America.
There have been some contradictions.
Martin Sander, paleontologist in Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the silhouette, who lived in the present Poland and belong to a group of dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a wrong vision because in South America there is a large number of dinosaur fossils that have been preserved when there is virtually no such thing on other continents.
On the other hand, how did the dinosaurs become the dominant tetrapods of the second century while they came from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile branch, still remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the present crocodiles and with many other Saudis.
Towards the end of the Trias the dinosaurs spread across the planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
However, such success is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two assumptions.
There could have been a massive extinction to which dinosaurs have survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted and could thus eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favorable meteorite was the expansion of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and had been growing in the shadows since then: it was mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories all over the world.
There are professors from University of Toronto, University of Cambridge, University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those in charge of courses at the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Breme.
The evacuation by the casino police at J.W. Goethe University of Frankfurt makes waves all over the world.
278 professors and teachers at J.W. Goethe University, as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North America and South America express their solidarity with the Protestant students of Campus Westend.
In a statement drawn up in German and English, he condemned the police intervention requested by the university's governing committee.
Last week, the President of the University of Werner Müller-Estler had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers after the walls and works of art were barb away from graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories believe that the degradation did not justify "a violent intervention by the police team against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
The evacuation is an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and education.
Focusing exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegate and criminalize the protest" and try to forget the reasons for mobilization.
The University Steering Committee thus drew attention to discussions that would still be essential.
Those in charge of the course require immediate suspension of criminal proceedings.
The majority of the population did not participate in the degradation.
Legitimization of protests
The young members of the Green Trade Union of the Service Sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity among students.
The protests are only the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, Regional Secretary of the Youths of the Verdi Union.
As for the Minister of Science of the Country of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took action and caused the action undertaken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of places is totally unacceptable, she told the regional Parliament of Wiesbaden on Thursday during the TV show Current Hour.
We understand the meaning of the protests, but do not accept vandalism, said the MP of the Peter Beuth Regional Parliament.
The parliamentary groups of the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Gauche (the Left) did not share that view.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the La Gauche (Linke) party
Instead of reflecting on the arguments and claims of students, they are evacuated.
The La Gauche party has filed a motion which is the Minister of the Interior to report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new Silicon Valley
For a long time, it was the name of a secret city, which was banned from Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place to search for the secret weapon, under strict surveillance.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality is considered to be the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important sites of production and research in micro- and nanoelectronics are located there.
Since September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, the site of French sciences – with the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been mutual and last Wednesday meetings of the representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Strong Cooperation Protocol".
The signatories were the deputy mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and companies.
It is located at the Institute of Electrical Engineering in Moscow, the major Sitronics firms and Rossijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literally translated "Green City") draws its name from the wooden hills at the heart of which the research centres are located.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The scope of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be sufficiently high.
For its participants, this is nothing less than "the new heart of Europe".
S21, it is much more than the intrusion of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will fill the heart of the capital of Bade-Wurtemberg, in a chaos that is desperate for ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born in the spirit of the 1980s.
The main lines, with roads that ended in the city, had the reputation of being the remnants of the 19th century transport technology that had effect from the brakes of modern rail traffic, as it took a long time to pass the locomotives from the back to the front.
Come on, stop short, go – that's what you have to do.
That's why the line-heads have to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train crossing station, which is about halfway across the Trans-European Railway Magistral between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, where the slogan "the heart of Europe".
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost, to get the station into the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In other words, the main line stations no longer really have access and exit problems since there are modern, reversible trains with auto and pilot cars at both ends.
However, the realization of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched next to the new route from the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and community policies have taken this step.
The railway company is part of the company because it is the taxpayer who carries the costs of the largest project infrastructure of the Federal Republic and not the public undertaking.
From a urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
There is a urban space that, if you believe in the graphics of computer-generated planners, will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the expansion of the section are designed for a traffic of people to whom it was attributed - and is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time, there was still no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening trade in goods, as rail transport is much more respectable of the environment than by road truck.
But the new track, with its tilts, does not fit the freight trains.
The S21, which is much more serious, deals indirectly with many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be involved in the Souba project.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade, this money will be missing for other points of joining and engorging in the network.
The Department of Transport lists 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the extension of the section through the Rhine Valley of 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 this line has been built at a slow pace.
It would be really urgent to support here in depth on the mushroom.
But the S21 project has the effect of a braking shoe.
The route to the Rhine Valley is about to become the fungus of international goods traffic, and it is at the heart of Europe.
Government examines the judgment rendered regarding the airport
In the regional Parliament of Wiesbaden, the Government of the Land referred to the possibility of appeal to the Administrative Court of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to examine from a legal point of view the judgement rendered by the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case or the project to build the north-west runway at Frankfurt airport would be carried out.
The permit to land 17 aircraft between 23 and 5 a.m., as the Government of the Land intends, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air damage.
The coalition must have decided on 4 January if it wishes to make an appeal against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticises this deadline and tries to pressure the representative of the government to take him to the Federal Administrative Tribunal of Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD Parliamentary Group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promises made before the elections and to prohibit night flights. Otherwise, it will be regarded as a total failure to give a given word.
It is extremely difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said the Chief of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir by alluding to the FDP's electoral slogan "We have our promises."
Minister Dieter Posch rejects Schäfer-Gümbel's accusations that the government of the country is trying to authorize even night flights using "advocacy and robbery".
It takes time to conduct a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make decisions on the basis of a "fast first impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the statements by its party on the prohibition of night flights is completely out of the question.
U.S. Banks Reimbursement of Aid
The large American banks, very affected by the crisis, are at the heart of their relations with the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully reimbursed the Treasury of 45 billion dollars (more than 30 billion Euros), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp Rescue Plan.
The American TV chain CNBC reported on a report that Citigroup also planned to repay the aid received.
Bank institutions thus seek to remove restrictions imposed, which accompanied acceptance of the amounts, such as the limitation of the bonuses awarded to the managers and the higher costs regulation.
The Bank of America launched an increase in capital by selling securities to investors who reported to it $19 billion in cash.
The rest of the sum comes from bank deposits that are well filled by the sale of several branches of other sectors.
On Wednesday last night, Kenneth Lewis, Director General of Bank of America, took the initiative to express his appreciation to US taxpayers: the injection of capital has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capacity by purchasing the Merrill Lynch Investment Bank to the strongest of the financial torture.
The Citigroup also intends to provide money on financial markets to free itself from State protection.
The U.S. bank could thus launch an increase of $20 billion on Thursday, reporting the CNBC chain quoting banking environments.
Citigroup spokesperson did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
Finally, everything happened even faster than planned.
Only two weeks after the removal of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the German ZDF chain administration board, the successor is already appointed.
The Commission wanted to vote yesterday to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs the Berlin edition of ZDF, was the great favor.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also the wish not to further harm the ZDF's ZDF member Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 Commission members on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend the Nikolaus Brender contract for five years, but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council were declared in favour of the resumption of Brender and 7 others voted against. Brender's resignation by vote was a failure, which was both predictable and predictable for Schächter.
In fact, the CDU, which is a majority in the Board of Directors, had already been allowed to hear several weeks before the vote, did not wish to resume Brender's position.
It is Roland Koch, the Prime Minister of the Land of Hesse, who had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly estimated editor-in-chief by referring to the fact that the hearing rate for ZDF information emissions had fallen under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, suffocating the growing political influence on the ZDF.
At the end, there were even 35 public law experts who had implicated in the debate and who believed that the way in which Koch acted was anti-constitutional.
But it won't serve anything.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political sciences, teaching and Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Southwest Funk (Rhenania-Palatinate radio organ) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German national quota).
In 1983 he became a writer in the ZDF first in the journal of present-day journals.
Then his journey continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was assistant editor-in-chief of the time; then he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazines" (bimonthly information issue presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then head of the Berlinic editorial.
After Brender's resignation, while he was just elected journalist of the year by the Specialized magazine Medium Magazine, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
The Adversary of Koch to the Board of Directors, the Minister-President of the Rhine-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the proposals of the candidate's staff could not be blocked by a party political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to ask for the withdrawal of the political personalities of the ZDF Supervisory Committees.
Peter Frey, the probable successor of Brender had worked with the Board of Directors by criticizing the commission with tissue in his decision to clear Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the position of editor-in-chief without losing face, as the Board of Directors could remove it without suspecting a political partisan.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as liberal on the left.
Large cleaning in university studies
Part success for students: after one year of educational strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to become more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Governing Council, an agreement was reached that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lighten the weight of the examinations: a single examination should allow the selected study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload will have to be reconsidered to ensure "real and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also undertaken to organize more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master lines.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulation from one country to another.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have consistently spoken the word "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module must normally be completed by a single examination", one can read in a document of thirty pages on future conditions for admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, states that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, derapements should be stopped, which would significantly affect the studyability.
"Studyability" should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
Modules as well as the background must be carefully examined to see if you can't avoid this stimulant feeling that you sometimes feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest RAID knowledge on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate fraud.
Students should "have the opportunity and margin of manoeuvre necessary to allow and promote the personal initiative".
The new regulation will cover access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, however, which means that only in 2015 all cycles will be examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put pressure on Länder to focus on agencies so that the programmes were not overloaded and the review regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized universities have already been consulted with their regional departments to take appropriate measures.
Rhenania-Palatinate has so far been the only country to have agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize programmes to strengthen educational guidance offices as well as examination offices and international relations services.
Länder and universities provide for a budget of EUR 10 million.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to submit to Parliament an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act.
As a result, there will be only one study to close its studies.
The organization of studies will have to be more flexible, as well as the recognition of notes from other higher education institutions must be ensured and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all university cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition discussed the question of study conditions in the country.
The decisions were appreciated, but criticisms were made.
The Federal President of the Association of Socialist Students announced that he would like the organization of education policy no longer to go "back to the closed doors" of the Ministers and university directors.
Not later than the educational strike, students as individuals should be able to express themselves a little.
The future diplomats of higher education received the support of the President of the delegates of the Rectors' Conference (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful to us" she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom HRK works on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and the possibility for each Bachelor graduated to join a Master cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Länder provide students with the Bachelor of the present day, that there will be enough room for studies in Master and as good study conditions as possible.
Länder therefore have to hire more teachers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of facilitating access to the Master.
More than one bottom note on Herta Müller
It is by these words " arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work by poet Werner Söllner, in which he is the subject of disturbing phrases, the experiences of a dissident who has gained freedom in Germany but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first a professor of German and English in Bucharest and then a collection director in a youth publishing house before he was installed in Frankfurt on Main.
Söllner received various literary prizes; in 1993 he held the highly coveted poetry chair of the Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum of Hesse at the art house of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He talked a lot about him in non-literate circles last Tuesday, at a convention in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror deforming your security files".
Söllner made a statement that he recognized in front of his German-Roman fellow writers, such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, who had worked as an informer for the security police.
Söllner received the German language prize in 1989 together with some of the participants.
The enrolment tests had begun unexpectedly in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, "so someone who does not have enough to resist security intimidation."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant of Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honour of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his well-known literary works with the mechanisms of the power of dictatorship, the literary scene has been demolished and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the apimity and lowness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as the current knowledge can be said, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own Security file, IM Walter played a role, assures the literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had intervened in his favor.
"He had been able to remove it from all the difficult situations at the time," says Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this audience was unexpected, however, the dissident of his former collaboration with the Romanian secret services is not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for security spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Di Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims will have made speculations and sometimes found which real names were hidden last by Sorin, Voic and Walter's loan names.
Instead of Germany, where the consultation of the files of the Stasi is a reliable process, the attitude towards the inheritance of the files of the Security is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been continuously impeded and delayed in the past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council belonging to the Birthler institution was created to work on the Assimilation of the Security Archives (CNSAS) but the re-recovery of the files has been dealt with since.
Since 2005, there has been a law that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still very large is confirmed by the interview of a former security officer of Temesvar who, after announcing the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expresses himself in a three-pronged manner with regard to the award.
She had a psychosis, and eventually she was questioned only once.
The infamy of power thought that it could be expressed here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many outstanding issues are associated with the case of Söllner as this happens so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been robbed? The weighted reaction of the audiences, to Söllner's grandfather, lets hope that the follow-up to this chapter will be more defined by a thirst to know than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the Genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote below.
Tumults at the Champions League
It was the impression that a representative arrived there, shot at four spikes coming all right from a Christmas party, on which the manufacturer of sports items had cut off his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross mounted less than a quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier to his hand.
The man, whose skull would attract attention, let himself be led into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise, our 50-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he didn't drink alcohol and he wasn't happy anymore.
He had had a nice evening, but tomorrow he had to get back to work.
Because now it's going to start.
The words of Switzerland that we had just engaged three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth end well", that is, in the league of champions thanks to our 3:1 against the Urziceni Unirea in Romania" but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. This will be a brutal fight to avoid defeat."
The "great work" awaits us Sunday.
There, it's about repeating the results of the league of champions every day in Mainz.
And the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three expeditional goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11) must be overcome.
Lots to be drawn
The eighth final of the Champions League (match gor 16/17. + 23/24 February/match return 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be shot at Nyon on December 18.
The joy of the entry into full function of the successor of Babel was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not only moderated by the one who had been lucky, who had sent to the dissatisfactioned Stuttgart professionals, an unfavorable motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I saw the players and I told them that they should focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "blowing of souls" – Bigs – the recipe of success that sounded so often that no longer had any effect with the care of Babel.
He triggered a certain magic, along with Jens Lehmann - partisan of Babel - "in the foot when there is a new impulse there are sometimes things that we would never have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of pain breaks, advanced to the best player due to his dynamism, tries to describe the " phenomenon" found by a proviso "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "It is someone who passes on to action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But I guess Babbel missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the head yet, keeping the manager Horst Heldt safe.
For the time being, VfB Stuttgart needs especially tenacity.
Like Gross, players and the manager are careful to overestimate the victory against a completely over-defence and weaken the Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow four days later a bad wake in Leverkusen with the 0:4 , objecta Khedira.
Horst Heltt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the objectives of the season, but that they had others that were still far away.
We haven't passed the difficult one yet.
That Heldt on his 40th anniversary didn't have the heart to celebrate, even after the first victory at home for three months, it was from the events of the weekend that a television interview by the target guard Jens Lehmann rebounded just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, would contradict Heldt, in response to Lehmann's bitter criticism.
He accused the management of style weakness and said she had decided to change coaches under the pressure of puberty fans.
Lehmann also considered it a sign of a lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day of freedom after the games had been removed.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by a pure egoism" infenza Heldt and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends with these two quadrilaterals.
In any case, they agreed on the rest, namely that without the group's preliminary work by the replaced coach, the strong sport and combat representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for a great deal of success" and returned Heldt and Lehmann to heart – and even the man in the plastic bag aquiesça.
World Heavyweight Championship
Warming hot in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after 12 difficult rounds, Ukraine defends its world's heavyweight champion title according to the WBC Federation's version.
With the unanimity of the judges, it was necessary for the points to be made.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as a champion of the world of heavy weights.
The WBC federation announced that on Saturday night, the 38-year-old champion won a victory at the point of the uniqueness of the judges against American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defends with honor his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
In the past, Ukraine had won the WBO and WBC World Championship twice.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed the KO so much as expected.
Klitschko, a 39-time winner in 41 professional fights, has to confess his defeat twice because of injuries.
The challenger Johnson has to accept his first defeat in the 24th battle.
In Berne's Arene, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2,02 meters, to the left.
Johnson, 11 cm younger who, before the duel, had announced the end of Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's beatings, thus preventing Klitschko from putting into action its dangerous right.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, especially tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continues to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his beats only rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, has exceeded the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the battle.
He insults Klitschko the treatment of "vila zombie" who "is not really capable".
During Friday's weight, the champion couldn't stop himself from provoking Johnson by making him fall his sunglasses of the nose "to see his eyes".
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko has again been forced into his fourth battle since his comeback on 11 October 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered the "sa" WBC belt he had previously left without fighting.
This year, defending his championship title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Areola of the United States.
"I just took a shot in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Vladimir is a WBO and IBF Federation champion.
But it is British David Haye who, having demolished the great Nikolai Waljew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye had canceled a match against Vitali Klitschko, which was due to take place in September.
It would seem that his promotional company plans to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the Kunduz case.
The parties SPD and La Gauche (the Left) ask the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on Kunduz's air attack, the opposition accused the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately dissipating certain facts.
The Minister deliberately "formed a contradiction" on the murder of two tank trucks last September, said the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the issue of information from the ARD chain "Tagesschau" (the 20 a.m. newspaper).
Clearly, that means he's lying.
The order to kill was given to the total disregard for the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is, in substance, the content of the report by NATO, which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the goal of the trap was, not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured during the U.S. air raid that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Gauche asked the Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday, to speak as soon as possible before the federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Verts Renate Kunast party are of the opinion that Madame Angela Merkel must make clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the federal government's Afghan policy if the Chancellor, Army and Information Services approved this new strategy.
The Government ' s spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellery had no influence on the army's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were increasing to express doubts about the real reasons for the referral of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the Department.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had sent to Guttenberg regarding the attack of tank trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have undermined the existence of the NATO report and hid some embarrassing details to the Minister.
However, in the vicinity of the two senior officials, it is understood that they informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeineer Sontagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have requested in a mail clarification of the facts.
To date, he has not received a reply
On Saturday, the Ministry did not wish to comment on these allegations and referred to the Federal Parliament's Investigation Committee, which was scheduled to be the next Wednesday to bring the light on the facts in question.
The worlds of dream
Some see, awake, pictures and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
There is nothing but mental illness, or under the influence of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything goes very well.
When we are lying in our dream rooms, we can see without hindrance the worst dreams and ghosts.
However, the one who wakes up, experiences the state of dreams, hears and sees things that others do not realize, has speeded up the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices appear only in psychiatric patients or under the influence of drugs.
It's our imagination that's in question: it's the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint tables or write novels, but that sometimes stimulates the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to be found.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can be presented in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, to the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and effect differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the Prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the chamanas, psychosis and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitter substances of the brain - first and foremost dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - breaks and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delirious thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The earthly attraction force no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of awakening; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "a great similarity between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud's dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that make it up".
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a drawing band.
Its body is in two dimensions of the color called.
The earth's attraction has no power over it, it plans at the edge of the ceiling.
He's feeling a blow.
Behind him are the creatures of the devil wings, grinning, the blood-stained mouth, showing the teeth.
They pursue him, give him feet with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over the body.
Sounding voices, malicious, screaming, coming out of the walls and radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult him and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from his stereo channel, in fact a loop and attach it to a hook fixed to the ceiling.
He goes up on a buffle and passes the loop around the neck.
He's out.
The loop is decomposing.
What a lesson it is for you to learn, they scream in a heart to pull him the tympan. "Go to a clinic and take care!"
Today Henning T. 40 years old, he has lived six acute psychoses, the last two years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was launched by the LSD.
Diagnosis: schizophrenia, paranoia, in addition to maniaco-depressive psychosis, it takes medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
During my psychosis, I lived through terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in their schizophrenia life; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the inner world and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitement, which can cause them to suffer from hallucinations, megalmonia, relationship madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are neither rare nor rare.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the minor, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is drowned under the sensations.
Like a dream, psychosis opens the door to a tide of ideas and ghosts from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of the reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry of the CHU of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrene is at the centre of the situation, all of which has a focus on it.
At the same time it finds itself in a passive role, it is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general, they do not have the opportunity to adjust reality, illusions are cruel reality, wake up is excluded.
Make the experience once in your life of hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of the reality that is perceived during psychosis is essentially preserved".
Delicate thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of life takes place in a real framework.
Why our brain makes this kind of cabrioles is always an enemy to researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to temporarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition in schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers suggest that the individuals concerned have abnormal brain damage.
The brain's neuronal maturation is supposed to be disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a mother's viral infection during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is how the anomaly of the neuronal system develops and overcoming the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can be a psychosis trigger, if there is predisposition.
The same hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain warms.
What's crazy is, Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck tells us that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of it while others buy expensive drugs to get it.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on illusory image hallucinations and phenomena for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are a part of the typical concomitant phenomena of psychosis, but also an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, plaque sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or skull trauma.
It is surprising to note that under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They form when the areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not refractory enough; when our brain warms but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain injury or psychosis.
But also lack of stimuli, stress, grief of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, at least one third of the participants recognize that they have experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomériane before and goes to high school.
A young girl has to do the right thing to say.
If there were no images and voices.
During recreation, a young boy, soft, long-haired, sends the word to him.
When she answers her friends, they look at her, wondering – nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy young girl is a lunatic dreamer, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's certain.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy just as she sees and she hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence at the moment.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds this nice young man.
I'm crazy, she asks you sometimes.
But she well knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the appearances are generally defrosting.
Visions are often heavy.
When she is in class, she becomes unable to follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is obviously explaining equations to the table.
At night the appearances are generally defrosting.
When, in the dark of her room, she waits for sleep that arrives too rarely and too late, she often cannot make the distinction if she is awake or dreams already, if the images she sees, the grizzling faces or the young girl with bloodless details on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she screams at these creatures.
She doesn't talk to her parents or her friends, they'd take her for a fool.
In autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her hip last year and she lived with her friend.
One year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Since she came in contact with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Folly is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough incentives, the probability is that he has hallucinations at the end of a certain time.
I suppose the brain is not busy enough, so there's an animation.
Sarah K., the only daughter, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was old thinking, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience", according to Kasten "a place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, so they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that ghosts are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises her patients to enjoy hallucinations as a special talent.
There's only one thing between dreaming and hallucination.
Unfortunately, in our world too focused on consciousness, there is a rapid tendency to take the imaginary experiences for pathologists, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief doctor of the psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but which also contains something positive, creative - the foil is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of experience called oniroid, a particular form of the change in consciousness raised by the dream.
The oniroid vecus are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that it cannot differ from the dream even when it is awake.
The state of omniroid consciousness manifests during trauma or in extreme pathology situations as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully aware of it, they experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is separate from reality.
It is a state of mental limit between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
This is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, a capacity of organization that is given to us men, so that we do not obscure in the absence of consciousness.
It's all real later in the memories.
The Zurichian Peter Cornelius Klassen, an art historian, also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "The Change of Heart" as a soul's saving action.
He is 49 years old, at the time when his conscious share for a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain immobilized.
Claussen dives into a world he created from all parts, visit foreign places, travel in time. He is seen as an old man bound in a railway sanatorium, a robot with his hair watching over his health.
He lives in the middle of age among the nobles who make blood-based drugs.
He is taken away by a Greek motorbike who takes him to his country, surfing with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meeting a Korean mafia.
It absorbs completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Claussen, these internal journeys are fundamentally distinct from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, writing what he has lived.
Instead of dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even in the years to come.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intense than real life.
The intensity of this life is exacerbating the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oniroides, psychosis, hallucinations and psychological experiences show us how fragile our internal representations of external reality are even in the state of care.
Any change in the state of consciousness, says psychologist Kasten "may cause a deformity of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snows can fall
Burda
At 27 years of age, children will follow the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment to the Burda editions' PDG post is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to recapture the press group, he told the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, editor Hubert Burda sees his society between the hands of his children
Both children will inherit at 27 years of age and are firmly determined to integrate society, says Hubert Burda, 69, in Spiegel.
All the details have been set in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will then arise.
We'll also have to see if they can do it.
It is not possible to impose its children on 7,500 employees without knowing whether they have the capacity to take care of it.
This would damage children as well as the company.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he retired from the post of President-General from January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
He then took care of the Treasury sector, that is, he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the lead in marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time, it's not a family member who's in charge of Burda's editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to link the next 10 or 15 years."
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in families that have been allowed to run through a capital bulimia, which have made huge unfortunate speculations, thinking that they could get worse and higher.
That was never my strategy.
I never dreamed of universal power, Burda said.
I do not see myself in the role of the country's successor as Springer could be, and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues such as Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Full Beauty
All you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, is hand-made.
This is the goal that has been set by El Corte English, which has just entered the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, includes prestigious teaching such as Hedonai, a specialist in laser exploration, Spaxion, with its relaxation and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Taci, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a sports room, or L'Occitine and its natural cosmetics, among others.

A total of 250 m2 is divided into 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy care.
For example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The sports room also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide customers' steps, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos show us how to perform our exercise program properly.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (heating and extinguishing), enough to make all the muscles of the body work.
And, if after having done our body work, we want to go through the coffee room, the teacher Luis & Taci has a room where we offer hair repair, lightness or nutrition rituals, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the order words of this urban spa, which will be opened every day of the year from 10 a.m. to 22 a.m.
Miscellaneous Collections
Christmas approaches and it's never superfluous to study the star look to adapt it to our party dress.
The form of decolletation, very important to appreciate the silhouette, is one of the variables we need to take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated decolletation. This is not very recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The company Endesa, in collaboration with the Towntación de Barcelona, created the "LIVE Office".
This is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" will define and coordinate the road map for the installation of the electric car in the city and establish mobility agreements, taking steps, coordinating, providing grants, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 “Electric Cities ”
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the implantation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Séville came to join the project.
It is the three cities chosen by the government, within the framework of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
The power company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
It aims to promote research and technological development in the autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative that Endesa participates in with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in European-wide standardisation groups and has a set of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero interviewes "a future of peace" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, interviewed "a future of calm" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
At the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Car Sector Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a abandonment landscape, closing some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to remain in Spain in a highly competitive sector, we can consider a peaceful future for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Full Plan for the Automobile Sector (PIA), has devoted EUR 800 million to projects by 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliaries, which have mobilised more than EUR 3 000 million investment.
The Chief of Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted government support measures for demand, in line with Plan 2000E, in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the Chairman, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and contributed to a "high increase" of registrations, which had progressed by 40 per cent in November.
20 000 m2 of car collection
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Chamber of Car Collection, a meeting space for the professionals and enthusiasts of the engine world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
They are an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can we find motorcycles and car collection, but we can also find in ClassicAuto Madrid articles of any kind related to the engine world.
Thus, in the exhibitors of the pavilion, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will make collectors happy and curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among other things, Classicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restaurant, Cupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restaurants, or Cochera Classicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Exterior aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this salon will also include parallel activities: collections, sports exhibitions, fitness tests, presentations and competitions.
Tests of fitness with cars and pick-up motorcycles will also take place on a circuit built outside the park of exhibitions.
Mazda3 i-Stop : A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda hears evidence that the sport spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated on Mazda3 the engine stopping and starting system, baptized i-Stop, a device which, at least for the moment, is only available on the 2.0 engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note it has obtained in its entirety.
Details, vehicle finish, real estate, behaviour, mechanics, i-stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable about the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the wheel is also particularly pleasing to him.
By continuing with the overall set of controls and consoles, we see how Mazda continued in Japan's tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and commands, as well as live colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, are in contrast with the sobriety of German products, and especially with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to overcome.
By continuing with the living room, this compact Japanese car offers more than enough accommodation to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this, a large box of regular forms is added.
The engine's automatic stop and start system, at least for the moment, is only available on the engine with two litres and 150 horses and with manual change of the six speeds.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its fineness, its low noise, its benefits and the control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most requested Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not carry out a large number of kilometres a year should not exclude this i-Stop with engine essence, both for its great comfort of speed and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model selected for the test is the Sportive, in other words the one that presents the largest number of serial elements.
Among the serial equipment, the road change assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed regulator, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the audio bluetooth, as well as 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
In addition, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack, which includes, for more than 1,500 euros, other elements of adaptable bi-xenon headlamps and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of the materials used, by its behaviour and by its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not do many kilometres per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 2.0 engine of 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between €21,770 for the Luxury finish and €23,270 for the tested model, Sport.
In contrast to this important amount, Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction every day.
"First" luxury
L.A. covers the red tape of sensuality incarnate by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever inspired us, dressed in models as elegant as they are for Nina's release. (Photos : Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had chosen for a dark "lady".
The FonPeek Promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to watch your e-mail, without offering the opportunity to see some kind of attached parts or to browse the Internet.
It enjoys its five-minute glory in the United States, when Time magazine designates it as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is more difficult to see him in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly price and subscription, or less than half of what it costs, for example, the iPhone's subscription date.
In view of its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free living data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's as limited as his American grandfather, but it's a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those traveling with a smartphone already know what it is like to give up data when you cross a border or desperately looking for a café on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult your mail.
The idea of a fixed price roaming is incredibly seductive and it has long been intended to work.
Indeed, some operators have special arrangements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have made a physical thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
The repeated calls by the European Commission to propose affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a painful effect.
Outside of his country of origin, we are reluctant to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device such as FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon while it does not have Wifi) offers this type of tariff, meaning that operators start to think differently and study various proposals allowing them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other research on the Internet.
No subscription and no gallery.
It is a connected device and is paid at the time of its purchase, not every month.
And that is what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: a life-access option like Peek already offers it to the United States.
Not that I wanted to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer presenting the same system.
The preferred colour of Michelle
The yellow is undoubtedly the preferred color of the first woman in the United States.
If Barack Obama became the president of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, she chose the same to accompany him at the second moment, no doubt the most important of her life: the return to Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pulling green with brilliant reflections, twice, the dress consisted of three parts: clothing, clothing and clothing, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or necklace.
Although at first glance, it would seem that the first woman in the United States follows the siege of the Asturias Princess and has chosen to restore the same custody.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick tooth, on the other hand, it brought a printed velvet to Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium-sized green shoes for the first time, and a similar but dormitory model this time.
She also changed hairstyles: hair is now detected while she was wearing them both before.
75 per cent of working mothers have had occupational problems due to their maternity
Labour discrimination has increased in recent years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
This is what the study "Fécondity and professional career of women in Spain" by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer reveals.
The survey, conducted by 9,737 women 15 to 75 years of age, leaves no doubt as to whether 75 per cent of the mothers who work have seen their career limited due to maternity.
The study shows that there are many differences between the start of married life and the number of children, whether or not women work and the type of employment employed.
Those who have no activity outside the home, work part-time or have little stable work, get married early, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are retiring in marriage and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of age have their first child, on average, 3.7 years of age after they are married. This figure goes to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "These data show that women who have stable employment need more time in their lives to get it, which has led them to abandon the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised greatly influences maternity, but less the start date of common life," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that increases the gap between the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, those who conducted elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years of age on average.
"Another distinuation also appears among women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have performed elementary studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have conducted middle-level or higher studies invest this program and give priority to getting a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger also deserves good
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will incarnate the image of several products of the brand, enchanting the universal currency "Because I like it well".
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actors in the international scene, has thus joined other celebrities registered at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if selected were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
In men, the cosmetic brand also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in Lost).
The prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the world of fashion.
Its largest representatives, creators and mannequins, both yesterday and today, met for the annual redistribution of their prices, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed your meeting.
The former mannequin Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chose Best mannequin of the year.
Manuel Vincent's Aces Poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poker of Aces (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have spent their literary life (and sometimes their other life).
It does not do so according to the predictable and understood genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the character's insignia core.
The trip is exciting and Vincent does not save the friars or the lighting.
Delightful, this book is also an exciting invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you here for a few minutes.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical pulse, the same that I felt without naming it: pleasure against the funty destiny, moral guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotent and ignorantness, with a poetic humour, blabbering, brutish, like the blade of the knife that failed to kill him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted for thirty years, in the flesh of which he combined the emotion of adultery to the pleasure of sorrow, a spiritual privilege that was to reach heaven by the way of destruction."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which has to be recorded by the north face, on which the best climbers are still and always taken."
On William Faulkner: "It was a strange guy.
From himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner of the county and other times that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
These two dreams were of great size. ”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the demented cry from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo until the end of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he did it in the flight of himself and calling for posteriority with a violent speech to the astics."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneels down and prays: "God bless, I beg you to make me stop writing as a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave the faces of Spencer were engraved: "Sleep after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ rest after the war,/ after life, fatigued death."
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband agreed very normally that she told her that Edward VII was the spy among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man as patient and loving as a nervous person whose literary talent exceeded madness."
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if it is not to try to dissipate Joyce at Baroja?
What if it's not to shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What did this do if it's not to abstinence this man's glory for him to serve as a pedestal?"
A Lace of Aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years passed next to her and our dog, a blood-stained, saved from the SPA and weighed no more than six pounds, and without a word, they struck her with two legs that left the dog severely injured.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what it is like to attack a small animal without defense free of charge, which, in addition, was left behind.
In addition to this, the indignation of a woman who walked quietly and who, when she ignored these individuals, became afraid of her physical integrity, because an energy that attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person less than him.
The episode took place at 5:00 a.m., one Tuesday like another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been moaning all day.
We have heard a complaint from the district commissioner, even if we suspect that this is very important and not to touch the sensitivity, we just want to make it clear that the murders were Spanish.
Angryness has led us to deny this fact.
We do not understand what is happening in young people so that they find it fun to abuse a defenseless animal free of charge that gives us affection, friendship and company.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for the port of the helmet
The Michelin tyre manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the port of the helmet, mainly among the younger motorcyclists, as both structures have said today.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of the helmet port, since it is the only protection element to prevent injuries to the head, or even death, in the event of an accident in two wheels.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign included its commitment to road safety, which "is beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products" and stated that it was contributing to this objective through other educational and information activities.
This new campaign to encourage the port of the helmet in two wheels, under the currency "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which the posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since as a manufacturer of two-wheel vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6 per cent compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the Ampac and Ganvam's employers' employers' union.
However, the good news should be announced, as the reference to the comparison, November 2008, was particularly bad, with a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the rebondation of the last month, the accumulated registrations during these 11 months are 40% below those in the previous year.
Since January, if all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (tourism cars, pick-up, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95 853 were sold.
The large clouds that affect their most demand are not so dissipated; in fact, although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100 per cent of cases through external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in limiting bank loans, other factors such as increased unemployment rates or the persistence of the bad economic situation must be added.
In view of this situation and the difference between tourism vehicles, aid for the purchase of 2000E has not been used.
In addition to individuals, independent and SMEs wishing to buy a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, they can also benefit from it, but the number of operations speaks of themselves.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, we again recalled the need for administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (camps and buses).
The Association of Dealers provides for a 2010 year similar to the one that ends, for which it calculates a 19% fall in sales (tourism vehicles and 4x4).
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As this took place with the ABS brake anti-lock system and as it will take place with the ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will be an essential element of European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered light commercial vehicles and tourism cars, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The European Union's objective is to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by its way of action, it can also help to avoid many back shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the driver's foot cut.
But the latter doesn't always keep the pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of vehicle components Bosch, one third of the drivers involved in an accident were unable to support the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from all its strength.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in return, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of element, up to 1 100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided every year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of those intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that a disaster on four with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, by means of a radar or camera, detects the obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not respond, and although the collision is inevitable, the device shall make the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors rejects the plan for Opel until January
While workers at the factory Opel de Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that he would need more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, believes that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to workers and then to the governments of the countries where factories are located, will be postponed until early 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, a decision on Saab's sale should be made in the next few days.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the Swedish government has put pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as quickly as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the application of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, supported by the Russian Converg group, is important.
In the event that there would be no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Baic Chinese company.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold remains.
They're flying from Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and precious jewelry, Porsche engineers left Boxster S and managed to complete nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1 275 kilos.
This led them to move, first of all, from the automatic roof that was replaced by a manual bottom roof, allowing to reduce 21 kilos, to use aluminium doors such as those of the GT3, 15 other kilos less, to remove the air-conditioning, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of gain, to mount sports tanks, another 12 kilos, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, thus winning six other kilograms and replacing the handles with cloth handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the double-twisted PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on the roads of the California secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His conduct can only be irreproachable.
The weight reduction does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with an ambo.
On the contrary: it has been a long time since we had not tested such a small and lightweight model that at the same time guarantees so much security in the turns, including at high speed.
It's a little athlete, able to heat up his little muscle speed during the necessary time, until we asked him to sprint, slow down, recover and push his engine again...
That's what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as precise as it says, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the steering wheel.
And she'll do it with a surgical precision.
Vulnerable engine sound
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the "sport" option or by a system that changes engine roughness, already used on Panama.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either at the stop or during recovery.
The suspensions are closed, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The cover of the roads we traveled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite low, but the car managed well with chicken nests.
Electronic assistants barely made a presence on the whole route, while on some turns we found the mirror in the morning and the engravings later in the morning.
In the end, an ultra-light car, more fun driving and is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at a price of EUR 70,831.
“ Back Girl ”
Carl Lagerfeld's intimate friend, Coco Cocoon's icon and casual starlet of the house shows, the singer displays her bad girl face with as much content as her Chanel bags.
More than a "Bad Girl" or "It Girl" is a "Bag Girl".
Basconia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a 91-82 victory during its visit to the hard terrain of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by the Dusko Ivanovic team. It is thus at the head of its group, after Mirza Teletovic's great show, which, with eight three-point banners, was the best of its team (29 evaluations).
Vitoria's team has managed to complete the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of commitment and collective work, even though it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 banners with three points marked, largely determines the final victory.
The game began quickly for blue and red, which took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four panels of the Vitoria team were marked since the perimeter led to predicting that they had jumped on the Israeli field with the hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20th end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but the Alava team chose the inner game of Barak and Elijahhu's work, which was received by acclimatizing and cheering back to his old home, to increase their benefit at break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to make himself the best player of his team, with 13 points marked, although the "less than six" evaluation of Splitter had already left to predict that this night would not be the best of Brazil.
But in this game, despite being on the right track to rest, nothing was played, far away from there, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria that we didn't get so easily on their ground, and thanks to "Elijah's hand", they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the advantage of the yellow on the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
The players of Ivanovic, injured but far from being dead, needed to channel some skilled action to take the air, and it was at this time that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun, which, with three posters at three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas, sent the counter to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the premises were able to accentuate at the end of the third quarter time (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play everything at all during the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they were not going to let anyone take what they had earned during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support her from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for errors, Ivanovic's players did not hurry, defend well, and although the Israelis were getting close at the last minute (80-85), the party was already playing and the victory escaped to Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Wounds prevent Unicja from delivering battle
Unicaja lost in Greece in the face of the Olympics and gave her the head of Group B of the Euroligue, during a match marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which made Greek victory easier.
The Malaga team was not discouraged by the atmosphere of the flagship of Peace and Friendship or by the vastness of the rival, no doubt one of Europe's most powerful and budgeted.
The game of the first quarter, has led to the dream of the Andalusians. An aggressive defense and three posters at three consecutive points, two of the manager Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who has swept the local team 12-18, at the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the internal game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed the score to be reversed 22-20 at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of baccarat, between the American players Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to function by showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit to hurt the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez weighed on Unicaja.
The internal players and Lithuanian eagle Linas Kleizas, with their three-point banners, increased the advantage 44-32, at the nineteenth minute.
Impossible to pick up
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos, which, despite the 19 losses, was shown to be higher and even equal to the difference in the meeting in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, causing the group's head to be cancelled.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organization, the three-point panes of Cook, and Lewis' support, left little hope with 66-57, at thirty-one minutes.
But victory was practically impossible because Olympiacos proved implacable when the players were under pressure and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, successful at 81-62, at thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submits, accepting the victory of Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new Trovit application, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate, employment and vehicles in Spain.
The "How much should you be paid?" tool calculates the salaries of users from more than 140,000 jobs offered by Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
Since a week of application, the search engine has found that, as a general rule, the Spanish worker "is feeling badly paid", explained in a communiqué the responsible for Trovit's products, Albert Ribera.
According to data available to Trovità from its research engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45 226 euros per year and a French, 31 059, while a Spanish receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34 247 euros per year in England, 25 751 in France and 16 420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the minimum paid work in Spain is that of the server, with 11 592 euros per year, followed by the seller, with 14 725 euros, and that of the worker, with 15 667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are driver, medium-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a time limit for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his Tegucigalpa embassy.
The vice-chairman will have to leave the diplomatic legion no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, in charge of affairs of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed on TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been refugees since 21 September before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, following his mandate, he must seek another destination."
The chain also cited the former envoy, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the appointed time: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the 29 November elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Embassy of Brazil until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, as Zelaya refused the political exhilaration that he meant to impose on him the government actually presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you so much.
After days of roses since last spring, during which the inflation of the assets has been the dominant market note, uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising because it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future by an uncertain nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise markets has been to currencyize debt through the direct acquisition of assets and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at close zero rates, so that financial institutions purchase assets to mobilise.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have been practically completed and, without challenging their non-conformity liquidity policy, they begin to put a little sand in the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their award for one year next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are seeing a reverse reduction in risk premiums.
The volatility of stock exchanges and the deviations from corporate obligations are increasing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize their private risk and public debt is again affected.
Once again, there is a shift towards quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the shelters chosen by investors, leading to an increase in the differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this unstable episode, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened a new revision to the decline in the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the moral risk defenders, who tried again to raise a case of conscience among those responsible for the world economic policy who had slowed down the destructive effects of the limitation of the credit on the destruction of employment, whereas what should be done is a new day of thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai is similar to a trivial struggle between the emirs to give its place to the power of the emirs and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that lowers a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot to the roses.
I sold it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be totally irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a member country of the euro area to fail to comply with its commitments.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and has made its citizens responsible for the need for special measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we face an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after a few excessive positions, that would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt gap increases to the extent of European business obligations, we do not have to worry.
If European differences were to decrease and our growth continued, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncrasic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdotes. When our predictive indicators force most study services to anticipate their recovery models and to review their forecasts upwards for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which come back to charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not open much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for the moment "preciousness is mother of care".
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the Congress Sub-Commission of Members, which discussed Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades.
After his intervention, which was followed by the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán called for the press what he had said in front of the subcommission at eight o'clock.
For the President of Iberdola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 000 million by 2020 and EUR 60 000 million more between that date and 2030, in case nuclear power plants are still in operation today.
If that is not the case, the investments required would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the issue changes, and power will have to be increased.
Its pari focuses on both the gas and coal plants, with mechanisms for recovery of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, it considers that 18,000 MW more are needed, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in line with what its company demands, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage national coal consumption, which contradicts policies to combat climate warming.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term parity" in this sense, despite the "point-to-point" measures, as the President of Iberdola described them.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that the decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, must begin to be taken, as they take some time before they reach maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Air Lingus handling market in ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for ground airport services, will play the privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Centre for Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation.
The Alliance provides for an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to research energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Actiona disputes its first highway in Australia in Hochtifif and Bouygues
Actiona fights for its first concession highway in Australia, a market on which it is already working as an energy company and a water manager.
The yard is an estimated $1,700 million Australian ($1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtift are its rivals.
A tunnel of 5 kilometres long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the option to allow Akonia to settle in the country as a public and car dealer.
The mayor of the city wants to be able to make it available for the end of 2014.
After choosing the public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the payroll.
Pending the submission of their offers in May, the planned investment amounted to $1,700 million in Australia (about EUR 1,047 million) and in the last phase three consortia, with a significant presence of European builders.
The baptized Transcity group is led by Akiona, the only Spanish company in smoothery, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, located in Italy, is one of the largest European underground specialists.
Against the Actiona team, the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues, was built.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, the capital of which is shared among the Australian Lighton (the subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtift, which has its own participation in the ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gallois company specialized in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large buildings and privatisations, but entering it is a great challenge if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by Hochtif and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and still an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
The ACS has barely acquired a place on this market by its 30% participation in Hochtifift, owner of Leighton.
Monetary assets
Actiona placed on a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a wide presence through its energy supplier activity and in the de-salinization sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and manages the group of companies responsible for raising and managing Adelaide delineator, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to benefit from synergies to enter the infrastructure construction and management markets.
The underground road to pay, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and Northern Link (north link), is called to link Toowong's western highway to the peripheral road in Kelvin Grove (see map), 4 kilometres of tunnel. It is the largest project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule established by the Administration indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this route will be opened at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will consist of two routes, an electronic pay system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million) for its financing.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtift
Australia continues to make Hochtifift widely fruitful, which mentioned yesterday the acquisition of a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The company in charge of ACS will, through its local branch of Leighton, equip the infrastructure of the national high-voltage fibre network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have rapid Internet access and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has given up the King George Tower construction project, 27-storey, in the city of Brisbane. The work has not yet begun and Hochtift has completed the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is expected to allocate a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine branch, is dedicated to the construction of a tunnel of 2.1 km long for a motorway in Slovenia, amounting to EUR 64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after having been given a view of the expansion work of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the yard is scheduled for early 2010 and its implementation will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore saw Renfe's advertising bid
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of these two years to Ms. Rushmore, for a budget of approximately three million euros a year, said the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been chosen from 16 agencies that have submitted themselves to the call for tender organized by Renfe, four of which have been finalists, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of campaigns.
A 63 million fine in France Telecom to stop competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of EUR 63 million in France Telecom for its anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean region of the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephone by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and programs of loyalty to consumers outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company, has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, due to the obstacles it has placed on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was increased because the competition authority considers that France Telecom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore reciprocated.
A store of applications
On the other hand, the French company's mobile phone company has followed up with other operators and has opened an Internet application store, with the aim of increasing revenue that does not come from voice transmission.
At the beginning, the Orange application shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 to arrive in other countries like Spain.
Their participation in the League of Champions has reported 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
In fact, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have won 467,4 million, which puts them in the third and fifth positions of the clubs that have put the most money in this competition.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for major clubs.
In fact, the competition allocated EUR 5 362.5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament during the 1992-1993 season, according to the UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The White Club was the third of the continent to touch the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, has won the trophe three times.
The Catalan club, currently under the title and the last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is the fifth on the list.
The Manchester United and the Bayern of Munich are listed, the two teams that also billed the most money for their participation in the last League of Champions.
And that, although they lost in front of Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the League of Champions, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for the distribution of money applied by the UEFA.
For this year, Michel Platini's agency plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the League of Champions.
Of this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification games (including Madrid's Athletics) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have managed to participate received 3.8 million only to be there, plus EUR 550 00 for each game they competed for.
There is also a bonus in the event of victory (EUR 800,000) and equality (EUR 400,000 for each team). Those who arrive at the eighth end receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive at the fourth end receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will receive 4 million each.
And the champion will win 9 million, against 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, for fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça has attracted 2.5 million to win the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, which are devoted to 337,8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important and has four attractive places.
The previous year's championship is 40 per cent of the money, 30 per cent for the second, 20 per cent for the third and 10 per cent for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of games played during the current year's edition.
New Rumasa offers EUR 61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The New Rumasa Group yesterday listed details of the offer of purchase of shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos capital.
A percentage that does not force it to launch a public procurement offer (OPA) for the whole of the securities.
In particular, New Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, which will be paid in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this report.
Yesterday, Sos' shares ended at 1.85 euros , and New Rumasa's offer thus rated the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects Sos' actual assessment.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez Group provides a 15-day period for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
The CNMV made sure it was not informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos' company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If so, the discount would amount to 611.7 million, while Sos capital is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos pursues the restructuring of his management.
In an attempt to stay out of any bids to buy and go and come judges of his former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that is actually the first woman to occupy a position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group's president.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Furthermore, the possibility that in the next few months its disclosure of new fund-debts cannot be excluded.
Regarding the loan to Salazar, former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) said yesterday in front of the National Hearing that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
The CNMV authorizes the Fatherina Exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) approved yesterday the OPA exemption presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paterina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the existing standards and that it considered the content of the explanatory sheet submitted as a result of the amendments made on 2 December last.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerned the acquisition of 550 008 shares by Federico Paterina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95 % of the social capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to negotiations on Madrid and Bilbao's stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592 778 million shares were immobilized and could not be transmitted in any way before the end of the offer, indicating that the price had been fixed by Federico Paterina, in accordance with the rules in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each accident is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complex work.
To calculate the cost of repair between EUR 20,000 and EUR 30,000 by hand, including the parts and the work hand can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, this would be a matter of minutes.
For this reason, almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
Providers of services and solutions for disaster assessment and maintenance devote themselves to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then treating them and offering them to their clients as a useful tool.
In Spain, Auditex, of the North American Group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
The other companies in competition in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, although more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car leaves the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard job, as each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle must be cataloged and its price recorded.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image of each model can be used to click on the different parts of a tourist car.
In the case of a model sold massively, work can be prepared in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
In the case of a low-sale car, this may take three or four months. Currently, Auditex has complete information of 99.2% of the commercialized cars in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information about Porsche, but not Ferraris or Lamborghini.
As regards vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99 %.
In order to carry out the documentation and development of databases, Auditex has eight centres distributed worldwide (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in certain brands.
The national seat is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (in general from mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Auditex invests 90 million each year to develop these databases.
Every month 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and to offer various products.
The most frequent application concerns repair and maintenance, but according to countries, there are also tools to manage parts of the case or to calculate the veneal or residual value of a car.
The only company with a guide to the value of the opportunity cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Auditex does not propose it in our country, but it does so in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Auditex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to industry professionals.
This company offers ten different tools, the product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
There are cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint bars.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is EUR 5.75, for low-cost customers up to 10 times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of experts, negotiates its price with Auditex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it comes out of the assembly chain, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to plug on declared heavy vehicles.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, carry out geo-demographic analyses or know the current problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand have gone to the garage for a bread or how many have suffered severe disasters for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It commercializes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the official parts, prices and time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions to the assessment of accidents, accidents or neglect.
The assessment GT Guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased by 20 per cent per year over the last three years, with a turnover of EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she began her process of internationalization, with the implantation of an office in Paris.
On his side, Audetex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is achieved in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38% remain in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are located in Spain.

In our country, the company will receive EUR 19.1 million, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed in the $1,000 million grant, today its shares are estimated at $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it is next to the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auctions of injured cars
In October, the Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The operation involved a cost of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the capital of the company, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sales service is exclusively addressed to sector professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cash registers and professional vendors that need to be registered before they start operating.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 sellers and 4000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and in the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
In accordance with Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not absconded can be used as spare parts.
The collection cars can be reregistered, although they have been removed, after complex approaches.
Banknotes in four stages
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audetex company ensures that the user receives a currency in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, looking for the spare part, creating a currency and generating it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially in order to convince the older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 of tourism, 109 all-terrestrials, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and Internet connection are needed.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears then the required piece is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the hand of work, increases or reductions, and then he can print the device to return it to the client.
AudaTaller is not an estimate tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include the estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros a year, which can be credited.
Currently, Auditex works so that these images are in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, as it will, for example, allow them to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
