The proposed amendment has already been adopted by both bodies in 2011.
During the legislative period, a change occurred when the second row was first removed from the Bull and then approved with a related recommendation from the journalists on Monday.
The failure of the second proposal, which proposes the prohibition of agreements between persons of the same sex, could open the way for a compromise in the future.
After the process, HJR-3 will be checked again from the next selected legislative body either in 2015 or 2016 to remain in progress.

Karno is a famous but dubious English teacher who taught modern education and King's Glory care, while supporting that he had 9,000 students on the ground of his career.
In his notes, he had words that some parents viewed as boring and, as it has been said, used lexologies in the class.
The School of Modern Education accused him of printing large advertisements and put them on a bus without a license, to which he claimed to be the principal English teacher.
In the past, he has also been accused of violating intellectual property rights, but he has not been charged with an official charge.
One former student said that he was “uselessly in the class, taught meeting skills, and was treated as a friend of the students”.

The first economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Deng Shaoping.
Since then, China's economic dimension has been expanded 90 times.
For the first time last year, China exported more cars than Germany and moved across the USA as the largest market in this industry.
China's GDP may exceed the United States' proportion within two decades.
The tropical storm Daniel, the fourth storm named during the 2010 Atlantic typhoons, was formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm found about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has peaks of stability reaching 40 miles per hour (64 km per hour).
Scientists at the National Tunnel Centre predict that Daniel will be strengthened by taking the shape of the bridge by Wednesday.
Since the storm is far from over, it remains difficult to assess its potential effects in the US or in the Caribbean.

"One of the twins finally collapsed and began to leave the vacuum," said survivors Francissk Kowal.
The stars emit light and heat due to the production of energy during the merger (or combination) of hydrogen individuals between them for the formation of heavier elements.
Scientists seek through their work the creation of a reactor capable of producing energy in the same way.
However, this is a problem that is difficult to solve and will go on for many years until we see useful fusion reactors being built.
The steel needle goes up to the water because of the surface tension.
The surface tension occurs as the water patterns on its surface are strongly attracted to each other, more than they are drawn by the air patterns above them.
The water patterns form an invisible leaf on the surface of the water that allows objects such as the needle to fill up on the water.
The loop of a modern iceberg has two ends, between which there is an empty curve forming in the middle. The two ends allow better support to the ice, even when they are on a slope.
Because the base of the knife has a small curve, when the blade moves to one side, the point that hears the ice also makes the curve.
This forces the icebergs to turn. If the icebergs turn to the right, the skateper turns to the right, and if they turn to the left, it turns to the left.
In order to return to the previous energy level, it is necessary to release from the additional energy generated by the light.
This is possible due to the appearance of a microscopic particle of light called light.
Scientists call this process 'restrained radiation emissions' as people are driven by the intense light, and cause the emission of a photon of the light, and the light is a form of radiation.
The next image shows people to emit photons. In fact, of course, photons are much smaller than in the image.
The lights are even smaller in relation to the particles that make up the people!
After many hours of use, the filament beam in the lamp is burning and the filament lamp is no longer working.
It is essential that you be careful when you change your mind.
Originally, the switch of the lamp shall be closed or the cable shall be disconnected.
This is due to the fact that the electrical energy flowing into the pressure at the point where the metal part of the lamp is located may cause you severe electroplating if you touch the inside of the pressure or the metal base of the lamp while it is still to some extent within the pressure.
The basic part that takes blood in the heart is the muscle of the heart.
Blood departs from the heart through treatments called arteries and returns to it through other treatments called veins. Trichoides are the most microscopic tubes.
With his finger, the triceratopas poured out flounderings, trachea cracks and roots.
Some scientists believe that the Trinity ate grass, a kind of plant that was common during the Christian period.
These plants have the appearance of a small phony that had a top of nails, dark leaves.
A tricycle could remove the cards with his strong brakes before he eats the corn.
Other scientists argue that these plants are highly poisonous, so it is unlikely that a dinosaur would eat them, even though in our days frogs and other animals such as bats (who are descendants of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.
How would Jesus ’ weight work on me? If you stood on Jesus ’ surface, you would weigh less than the earth.
A person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) in Yo. So, obviously, your gravity is less attractive.
The sun does not have a flame on which you can stand like the Earth. The sun in its entirety consists of gases, fires, and plasma.
The gas is becoming more and more minute as you get away from the center of the sun.
The outer part that we object to when we look at the sun is called a light beam which means "light beam".
After about three thousand years, in 1610, the astronomer Galileo Galileo, who came from Italy, used a telescope and discovered that the Aphrodite has phases as well as Selena.
The phases are made because the part of Aphrodite (or our moon) gets light that shows to the mother star. The first phases of Copernicus reinforced the idea that the planets are turning dimensionally from our mother star.
After a few years, in 1639, a British astrologer, Jeremy Horoks, saw the passage of planet Aphrodite.
England met a long period of peace after the resumption of Danle.
In 991, however, Etilred faced a board of Vikings that was greater than any other than the Gathram era, a century earlier.

Originally, the alpha-mangull named it Huminjongum, which means "the right sounds for teaching people".
There are many theories about how the sensitivists were created, one of which concerns an Aria migration from the West to India, which brought their language with them.
Censorship is an ancient language and is considered to be relative to the Latin language spoken in Europe.
The oldest known book in the world was written in the censorships, and after the collection of surrogates, the censorships were lost because of the hierarchy.
Censorship is a very complex and rich language, which has been a source of many modern Indian languages, as well as Latin is a source of European languages such as French and Spanish.
Germany, as the battle for France had ended, began to prepare to enter Britain.
Germany gave the code name "Operation of the Sea of Lions". Most heavy firearms and supplies of the British army had been lost when they left Dunkerka, and therefore the army had weakened quite a bit.
But the Royal Navy continued to be much stronger than the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) and could destroy any invasion fleet was supposed to cross the Gulf.
However, only a few ships of the Royal Navy had their base on possible invasion routes, as the sailors feared that they would be forced by the Germans ’ air raids.
Let's explain, first of all, what were the plans of Italy. Italy was mainly the "small brother" of Germany and Japan.
Her pajamas and her marines were weaker, even though they had just built four new ships just before the war began.
The main objectives of Italy were the countries of Africa. To understand these countries, they had to have a military launch camp so that the armies could swim in the Mediterranean and enter Africa.
Thus, they had to be freed from the bases and ships of Britain in Egypt. Beyond these movements, Italian pilgrims were not supposed to do anything else.
As far as Japan is concerned, it was an island country, like Britain.
The submarines are a ship designed to travel under the water and remain there for a long time.
Subsidiarys were used in World War I and in World War II, and there was a very limited field of shooting.
At the beginning of the war they traveled mainly on the surface of the sea, but as the radar began to evolve and have greater accuracy, the submarines were required to enter under the water to avoid being understood.
The German submarines were called U-Boats. The Germans were well aware of how to sail and operate their submarines.
Because of the success of the Germans in subversive battles, after the war they are not allowed to have many of these at their disposal.
Yes! The King of Tuttagham, sometimes called “King of Tut” or “King of the King”, is one of the most famous kings in ancient Egypt in modern times.
It is interesting that it is not listed among the most important of the ancient kings, and it is not recorded in most of the ancient kings.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 was the one that made him famous, and many of the graves of the past had been buried, the particular remained essentially unreal.
The largest number of species placed on the grave with Tuttaghams are well preserved, including thousands of designs made by precious metals and rare metals.
The discovery of the wheels made the Assyrian weapons lighter, faster and more prepared to cross the soldiers and other weapons.
The arrows from their deadly toxins were able to pass through the clothing of the enemies. About 1000 B.C., the Assyrians also used the first cavalry.
The horse is a soldier fighting on horses, and the saddle had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian horse was fighting on the naked shores of their battles.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. The most popular, probably, knowledge of this culture is Omeros, the environmental blind poet, who wrote two literary arts: Iliada and Odyssey.
Sofoklis and Aristophane continue to be popular writers of the theatre so far, and their works are listed in the main works of world literature.
A famous Greek also is a mathematician called Pythagoras, who we know about his famous theory of the relationships of the sides of the right triangles.
There are various estimates of the number of people who speak Hindi. It is estimated that it varies between the second and the fourth most spoken language worldwide.
The number of natural speakers in the language varies according to whether the most common readers are perceived.
Speakers are estimated to range from 340 million to 500 million, while about 800 million people understand the language.
Hindi and Urdus have a similar vocabulary but different writing. In everyday conversations, both speakers and both languages can usually understand each other.
In the 15th century, northern Estonia was in the sphere of the cultural influence of Germany.
Some Germans wanted to bring God close to the people of the region, so they planned the Estonian basic election.
It was based on the German alphabet and was supplemented by a letter [‘õ / Õ’].
Over the years, many words borrowed from the Germans have come together, and that was the beginning of the study.

Turkey (East Thracian or Romilia in the Balkans) is 3 per cent of the country.
The territory of Turkey has a length of more than 1,600 km (1,000 miles) and a width of 800 km (500 miles), with a rectangular shape.
Turkey, along with the lakes, covers 783,562 km2 (about 301 thousand mi2), of which 755,688 (about 292 thousand mi2) are in Asia in the south-south and 23,764 (about 9 thousand mi2) are in the European continent.

Luxembourg was one of the founders of the institution called the EU today in 1957.
Drukgyal Dzong is a busted fortress and Buddhist monastery in the upper part of Paro District, Phondey Village.
It is said that in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal built the fortress as a reminder of his victory against the mighty Tibet-Mongolia.
In 1951, a fire caused only a few of Drukgial Djong's chemicals, such as the image of Zampdrog Nungung Namgial, were left.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected, and so far it is one of Bhutan's most thematic attractions.

To find out how to create interactive tools, you need to have conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools that you have completed in interactive learning (synography, audio and video processing, storytelling, etc.).
The interaction design requires re-evaluating your issues about the production of tools and learning to think in a non-linear way.
The interactive design requires the components of a project to be connected to each other, but to have meaning as separate entities.
The reduction in the fluctuation-modifying lens is that the complexity of the focus and the amount of the lens elements required to reach a range of focal distances is much greater than that of the constant lens distance.
This is the least problem due to the achievement of higher standards in the production of beams by the lamp manufacturers.
This allowed the focusable lamps to produce images of which the quality is comparable to that obtained with constant focus beams.
Where the lens zooms are also exacerbated is the fact that their top edge (power) is often smaller.
This makes it difficult to use the economic greenhouses in low-light conditions without flashing.
One of the most common problems in converting a movie into a DVD is overcompensation.
Most televisions have been built in such a way that the general public is satisfied.
For this reason, anything you see on TV had the limits cut on top, bottom and sides.
This ensures that the screen is fully covered by the image, known and overcrowded.
Unfortunately, when you create a DVD, the frames of the image can be cut, while if the video had subtitles close to the bottom, they wouldn't look whole.
The traditional medieval castle of ancient times inspired the imagination, creating images of battles, compassions, and artillery.
Even standing among thousands of years, it can bring to your mind the sound and the smell of battles from the depths of time, it can make you hear the noise from the weapons in the layers and smell the fear that comes from the depths of the drums.
But our imagination is based on reality; why were castles first built? How did the design come about, and how did their construction come about?
The characteristic of the period is that Kirby Muxloe Castle is more a guaranteed house than a real castle.
His windows with large windows and his thin walls would not be able to withstand a severe attack for a long time.
In the 1480s, when his construction began from Lord Hastings, the country was in relative peace, and the defence requirements were only for small gangs of evildoers.
The balance of power was a system through which the European States promoted the preservation of the national sovereignty of all European countries.
The basic principle was that all European States should seek to prevent a state from acquiring great power and, therefore, national governments often changed their alliances in order to maintain balance.
The Spanish Empire War marked the first war where its main cause was the balance of power.
This marked a significant change, as the European forces would no longer hold the proclamation of religious wars; therefore, the Triennial War would be the last war to be held in religious wars.
The House of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on 21 July 356 B.C.E. by an invasion by Herod.
According to history, he had a reputation for all costs, and the Efficients, who were expelled, announced that Herostrato's name was never going to be registered.
The historic Stravos, who came from Greece, later wrote down the name, which we know today, the temple destroyed the same night of the birth of Alexander the Great.
Alexander as a king was offered to cover the costs of rebuilding the temple, but his offer was not accepted. The temple was rebuilt in 323 C.E., after his death.
Make sure your hand is as calm as possible while you play all the correct notes at the same time — also try not to make excessive moves with your fingers.
So you will tire as little as possible of yourself. Remember that you don't need to slip the keys too hard to increase the tension like in the piano.

Mysticism is the pursuit of communication, identification, or understanding of absolute reality, divine quality, spiritual truth, or with God.
The faithful seeks an immediate experience, a feeling, or a recognition from the divine reality / the deity or the deities.
Supporters follow a specific way of life, or practices aimed at the cultivation of these experiences.
Mysticism separates from other types of religious faith and worship from the emphasis it places on the direct personal experience of a unique conscious situation, especially those with a calm, divorcing, happy, or even an exponential character.

The culture of the valley of India belonged to the region of Halkou and was located in the northwestern Indian peninsula, which contained the largest part of modern Pakistan as well as some areas of northwestern India and northern Afghanistan.
Culture developed in the openings of the Indus River where it took its name.
Although some academics assume that if culture was also in the mouth of the most dried Sarasvati river, it should be called the truest Indian-Sarasvati culture, while some call it the Harapa culture, the first of the locations that came out of excavations in the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire has helped to develop medical achievements.
The head of the August empire began to employ doctors who for the first time established the Roman health service that would take action at the end of the wars.
The doctors were given knowledge of various tranquilizers, such as morphine from the extracts of paparone seeds and slopapamine from the seeds of botanical seeds.
They obtained adeptibility to the acrostination to save patients from gagran, as well as to use haemostasis and biliary arteries to limit the flow of blood.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire has contributed significantly to the medical industry and has formed much of the knowledge we have today.
The Pyrland Origami is the type of paper-sharing that has the limitation that can only be done once, that there are no more complex duplications such as the opposites, and that all duplications have clear positions.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970 ’ s to help inexperienced doublers or those with limited mobile skills.
Children are aware of the concept of race and gender stereotypes that affect behavior.
For example, children who are identified with a racial minority who are subject to stereotypes such as having no good performance in school tend to have no good performance since they learn about the stereotype related to their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
These websites have received special attention, especially in the educational environment.
There are positive data on these sites, such as easy to form a teaching page, with websites, videos, photos and other possibilities.
This page can be easily accessible by providing only one web address, which makes it easy to remember and sign up for students who are having difficulty using the keyboard or spelling.
It can be adapted so as to be easy to read and contain the desired color quantity.
Lack of attention disorder “is a neurological syndrome whose three characteristics include confusion, distraction, overactivity or excessive energy”.
It is not an inability to learn, but a learning disorder. "The 3-5% of students, probably about 2 million American children, have the disorder".
Children with ADD find it difficult to focus on activities such as schoolwork, but can concentrate on activities such as playing games or watching their favorite mobile projects or writing suggestions without points of reference.
These children tend to face many problems because they are “inflicted in risky behaviours, involved in battles and doubting authority” with a view to driving their brains, as it is unable to fit into normal methods.
Relapse Warning Disorder affects relationships with peers, as other children do not understand why they act as they act or why they write as they write or that their level of skill is different.
As the ability to learn and acquire knowledge changed in a way like the one mentioned above, it also changed the basic percentage of knowledge.
The approach to obtaining information was different. There was no longer any pressure on individual recall, as the ability to recall text was more the focus.
In fact, the Revival has significantly changed the approach to learning and disseminating knowledge.
Unlike other factors, humans no longer use their hands to move or lift weights or hang on trees.
The hand and foot of the chibatze are similar in size and length, and indicate the usefulness of the hand in carrying weight during the four-step walk.
The human hand has less length than the leg and more straighter pens.
The old-age wastes dated 2-3 million years before showing this change in the use of the hand by facilitating the movement in the handling.
Some feel that living a lot of artificially conscious dreams can often become very satisfying.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the extension of the time of sleep with rapid movements of the eyes (REM) causing the exhalation of dreams.
By less REM every night, the situation in which you experience real sleep and your body resuscitation does not happen often enough to create a problem.
This is the same exhaust as having to wake up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch TV.
The results depend on how often your brain tries to have a sleepless dream every night.
At first things did not go well for the Italians in North Africa. Within a week of the proclamation of the war of Italy on 10 June 1940, the 11th of the British Oscars had understood the Capuzzo fortress in Libya.
At a gate east of Bardía, the British arrested the Italian military chief, General Lastoci.
On June 28th, Marshall Italo Balbo, governor-general of Libya and naturalist of Mussolini, was killed by friendly fires as he landed in Tomburg.
The modern sport of cymbals takes place at many levels, from students who learn at universities to professional and Olympic competitions.
The sport is performed mainly in the form of monogamy, as one dissipates with the other.
Golf is a sport where players use basketball to hit balls to get them into holes.
During a normal round, 18 holes are played, with players usually start from the first hole of the ground and end in the tenth eighth.
The player who makes the least hits or moves of the swing to the club to complete the round wins.
The sport is playing in grass, and the grass around the hole is closer to the ground and it's called green.
The most common type of tourism is probably what most people associate with travel: recreation tourism.
This is the case where people go to a place that is very different from their usual routine to relax and get along well.
The most common places for leisure tourists are the beaches, the theme parks and the camping areas.
If someone visits a particular place with a view to knowing the history and culture of this part, then this kind of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Visitors are allowed to go to several attractions of a state or simply choose to go to one place.
Having seen this activity, the Magistrates had also called for aid.
The armies that supported the pre-trial included the first and third New Hamsair constitution with 200 men, under Colonels John Stark and James Reed (and the two later became soldiers).
Stark's men were placed along the fence at the north end of the shelter.
When the intruder created a gap along the Mistiki river north-east of the peninsula, they quickly created an extension to the barrier with a close stone wall in the north that reached the edge of the water of a small beach.
Grydeley or Stark placed a passal about 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the fence and ordered no one to shoot until the regulars passed it.

By changing from one quarter of a mile to a half mile, speed gets less importance and endurance becomes absolutely necessary.
Of course, a first half-mile road class, a man who can exceed two minutes, must have enough speed, but must certainly cultivate his endurance.
A little abnormal road run during the winter, in combination with the discharge of the upper part of the body in a gym, is the best preparation for the period of stasis.
Only their good nutrition practices are not able to produce high performances, but they can have a positive effect on the overall prosperity of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, exercising effective irrigation habits and understanding the various aspects of complementary exercises can help athletes improve their performance and increase the pleasure of their sport.

The product market can be achieved on the basis of needs, but most will have a minimal or minimal impact on performance.
Sportsmen can feel a preference for a product even if it does not really benefit them.
The person can be considered one of the fundamental building units of all material.
It is a complex existence that consists, as the simple model of Bor says, of a major core that surrounds it with electrons in orbits, and reminds the planets in orbits around the sun - see Figure 1.1.
The two molecules that form the nucleus are the neurons and the protons.
The protons have a positive electrical charge while the neutrons are neutral. The electrons bring a negative charge.
To control the victim, the first thing you will do is investigate the point to make sure you are safe.

According to the results of the investigation, depression, fear and disaster mediated the relationship between pain and disability in people suffering from pain in the middle.
Only the consequences of disaster, not depression and fear, were the conditions of regular weekly structured physical activity meetings.
Those involved in regular activity need more support in relation to the negative perception of pain by separating the differences in the time of pain and the feeling of anxiety from the normal physical movement.
The vision or ability of the eye is directly intertwined with the sensory organs of the visual system or eyes.
There are various eye structures that are complex according to the requirements of the body.
Each construction has different possibilities, is sensitive to different wavelengths and has different levels of acidity while at the same time requires a different import adjustment process and different numbers for optimal operation.
Population is the whole of the organizations of a particular species within a given geographical area.
It is said that they have a form of persons in a population in case they are almost omnipresent in relation to some individual apparent knowledge.

What is cell (cell); the word cell is due to its origin in the word "cella", that is, a "small room" and was conceived by a microbiologist, who examined the structure of a pencil.
The cell is the basic building unit of all living organisms composed of one or more cells.
Cells are so fundamental and important for life study, which are often characterized as a ‘family unit of life’.
The nervous system maintains balance in the body by sending all over the body nerves that hold the flow of the blood continuously and irretrievably.
These nerve irritations can spread very rapidly throughout the body, which contributes to the body’s protection from potential threats.

Many dream of the day when man will be able to travel to another star and explore other worlds, some wonder what is out there, while some believe that there are alien or other forms of life on another planet.
However, if that happens, it will probably happen after a long time. The stars are so scattered in the area that there are thirty million miles between "neighbor" stars.
Perhaps someday, your disciples are in an alien world and wonder about their ancient ancestors!
Animals are made from many cells. They consume their food and make the cooking process inside them. Most animals have the ability to move.

For the first time, someone was looking at dead cells so close.
Chemicals and chemical compounds have the ability to change from one form to another and not turn into something else.
The gas nitrogen still has the same capabilities as the liquid nitrogen. Its form as liquid is more dense, but the ants are still what it was.
There is also water. Its chemical compound consists of ditomic hydrogen and monoamine oxygen.
It has the same molecular structure either in gas, liquid or solid form.
Although his physical condition may change, his chemical condition remains the same.
Time is everywhere around us and affects everything we do, and yet it is difficult to understand.
Time has been a study of religious, philosophical and scientific experts for thousands of years now.
We live time as a series of events that are going through the future through the present in the past.
Time is also the method of comparing the duration (extension) of events.
You can note the passing of time by observing the repetition of a circular event. Circular event is something that happens repeatedly on a regular basis.

The people who attended us for so many decades helped us to understand our strengths and our passion by carefully evaluating the difficulties and failures.
As we heard people share their personal, family and organizational stories, we collected valuable information about the past and some of the personalities that had either a positive or a negative influence on the body’s culture.
Although knowledge of history does not mean knowledge of culture, it helps the organization to feel people even in the sense of where they are historically located.
By assessing the achievements and understanding of failures, individuals and all participants are more aware of the ideals, purpose and engine forces of the organisation.
In this case, the call to previous business cases and their successful results helped people to be open to new changes and directions for the local church.

Concluding thinking patterns are strategies for dealing with issues that combine different thoughts or industries to achieve the deal.
This neuropathy focuses on speed, logic and accuracy, as well as on the recognition of data, the re-application of existing techniques and the collection of information.
The most important factor in this problem is the following: there is only one correct answer; the answers you think are only two, that is correct or wrong.
This way of thinking is related to certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with this type of thinking have a logical thought, have the ability to remember the pattern, solve problems and process scientific data.
Man is, by the way, the most charming creature in understanding what's in someone's mind.
This means that we can successfully anticipate the perception, the aspirations, the beliefs, the knowledge and the wishes of our fellow humans.
Among these abilities, understanding the intentions of others is fundamental, allowing us to clear up possible doubts in physical movements.
For example, if you see someone break the window of a car, you'll probably assume that he was trying to steal a foreign car.

The magnetic tomography (MRI) is based on a phenomenon of physics called nuclear magnetic coordination (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (worked at Stanford University) and Edward Parcell (from Harvard University).
In this coordination, the magnetic field and radio waves cause people to emit very small radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damanthian, a doctor and research scientist, laid the foundations for the use of magnetic tomography as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent certificate was issued, which was the first worldwide to be awarded to the Magnetic Tomography industry.
In 1977, Dr. Damandian completed the creation of the first magnetic tomography "all of the cormium" and gave him the name "Indomitable".

The over-modern approach to our learning is liberating from insolventness, and there is not one single way to learn.
In fact, there is nothing good to learn, and learning takes place in the experience gained between the learner and the knowledge provided.
Our experience so far with all the television broadcasting based on learning, construction and information shows this clearly.
Many of us find ourselves watching a television show that gives us information about a process or experience in which we will never participate or apply such knowledge.
