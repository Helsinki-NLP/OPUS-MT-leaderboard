Tom reads to his daughter.
My computer is expensive.
The gun came up.
Tom worked at the hospital.
I remember.
Continue reading:
Keep going.
Don't wander:
Sit down.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
Ask someone.
Look closer.
Hide.
We're the best.
Stop fighting.
It worked.
Don't yell.
Come on in.
Obviously, Tom is sad.
Tom played.
Tomorrow will be hot.
Tom was inspired.
Let's go.
Tom doesn't want to see how he talks to you.
They all went out.
I'm sorry.
I don't think you lied to me.
I just want to have the ability to say that I'm sorry.
Be careful.
He's gone.
Drive the car harder.
I don't want to go to school.
Be good.
Hold on.
You're so handsome.
I'm prepared to do it.
Sit here.
How many years have you lived here?
Tom was dancing.
It doesn't matter.
They lied.
Tom flew.
My mother's at home.
Be careful.
Thank you.
Stay tight.
Take a step back.
Of course:
How beautiful.
Do you think I should do that?
Incredible!
No one knows.
Write down your manuals.
How's your number?
It was a good fire.
Tom didn't go into details.
Attention.
Please stop.
Tom was getting bored.
They laughed.
Keep this.
Tom threw away his soul.
They didn't know.
I can't stand to think about it.
Come on in time.
Are you going to go on vacation this year?
Come in.
A little bit to that side.
That airline only makes cargo transfers.
Tom broke up.
And where did you come from?
Tom told me he didn't learn French at the university.
Sit down.
Look here.
Get out of here.
Is there anyone in the house?
I'm sorry I'm so late.
I hit Tom's face with a gun.
I don't agree.
Keep dancing.
Don't look at Tommy.
Tom did it by hand.
I sleep all day.
Find Tommy.
Tom Merry took his car home.
Women change the world.
A little bit tall, please.
Tell him I'm asleep.
Tom married a girl from Boston.
They all laughed.
He's afraid of the darkness.
I'm not so sure yet.
Fill with water.
I don't know if Tom's hungry or not.
Cut it out.
Someone's funny.
Abandon the game.
It was uncertain.
That's what I asked.
It won't change anything.
I don't get it at all.
Keep practicing.
Think about this.
What a shock.
Tom had to ask Mary for help.
Keep looking.
Keep going.
Can you tell me who's coming tonight?
Have fun.
Sit down.
Be content.
I don't know why Tom didn't come, and I don't want to ask him.
I remember.
One read:
Be focused.
Please fill in:
Be careful.
Feel this.
It helps.
Wait here.
Let's read it.
I don't know if Tom's hungry or not.
I believe that you will succeed.
Come to us.
One day you'll understand.
Look at it.
How interesting.
Stop, please.
Tom read what books?
I have two brothers and three sisters.
There are three parts of the kemping area.
Tom doesn't have time to talk to you right now.
Tomorrow, Tom has to go to school.
Keep digging.
It's amazing.
Change the scales.
Sweetheart, please.
He speaks very well.
Nsty, please.
I looked around.
Find it.
You tried.
Keep fighting.
Did you hear me at all?
Eat slowly.
I'm not a doctor.
This is a bird.
We're together.
Take everything.
Come to us.
You did the experiment.
Let me do it.
It's on the table.
Tom's got his new car in his head.
Contracts have already been negotiated.
Don't say anything.
Look under your fingers.
How can it be that you don't know?
Report it.
What a surprise!
They've been bitten.
Keep working.
Tom was wandering.
I wanted to read that book all the time.
Me, too.
They all laughed.
"Burge-califf, now considered the world's highest skyscrapers.
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Forgive us.
It was amazing.
He walks.
Come back now.
The tree swims.
Get out of here.
Put that down.
Try again.
I'll give you five minutes to solve this problem.
What are you standing for?
Let's move a little bit.
I didn't even think you liked Tom.
When do you make purchases?
They won.
My mother's at home.
Tom died as a result of a stupid accident.
The circumstances have changed.
I refused.
When do you make purchases?
Tom got better.
How does this work?
Let's do it.
Stop the experiment.
Follow him.
Tom wrote this three weeks ago.
Be patient.
Let it go.
It doesn't matter.
I sat at home for a week.
I started living alone.
Take this.
Kiss me.
Are you kidding me?
Tom was wondering if it's worth discussing with Mary.
Tom doesn't give a sign.
Be prepared.
Tomorrow will be hot.
Tom was laughing.
Time's flying.
We've forgotten.
Now I have to see Tommy.
Say "well."
They started a few hours ago.
Eat something.
He was weakened because of his blood loss.
Don't fight.
Be careful.
Try this.
Is there a man in the house?
Be reasonable.
Keep going.
Don't wait for us.
Translate the game.
Follow him.
I'm trying.
Tom needs something.
Change that.
When do you do shopping?
Come on.
Come on.
Sit down.
It's amazing.
Look again.
Who should give that?
Get up.
Stay there.
I talked to Tom tonight.
Keep trying.
Can you translate a scream?
Don't read.
They were swimming.
They called.
Tom doesn't care how he dress.
It happens.
We were honest.
Tom and Mary walked in a manhunt.
It can't be late.
We were alive.
We work together.
Take a break.
Say, "Visitance."
Let me relax my job.
Forgive us.
Keep dancing.
Keep warm.
Think again.
We've forgotten.
We didn't get anything.
From the beginning, ladies.
I'm not a teacher.
Tom didn't say much, which is a bad sign.
One day you'll understand.
At the time, people lived there in the early days.
Finish it.
Tom was in trouble.
Not at all!
It's going to be a silent move.
It's clear.
Say it.
Look around you.
Stop arguing.
Tom came to help us.
My attention went.
Take it.
Stop them.
Start again.
Keep walking.
Tom closed his eyes and looked like he was asleep.
Write this down.
Protect yourself.
You're sorry enough.
Everything is important.
Be careful.
Wait a minute.
Don't wait for us.
It happens.
They all shouted.
Let's not talk long and work.
Tom smiled.
He cleaned the dust with dust.
This morning the temperature fell below zero.
Did you think I forgot?
Be yourself.
Be careful.
They waited.
Tell everyone.
Who do you want to ask?
What are you offering me to do?
It's mine.
We're learning on the basis of experience.
Tom showed me Mary's paper.
Watch out.
They danced.
Let's start writing.
Hang on.
Now, put that down.
They walked.
Just tell me why you're here.
Look at that.
Tom got away.
Cut the noise.
This is my choice.
Tom is reading French better than I am.
Show me.
Tom's attention went away.
Take this.
Tom was fighting.
Tom agrees.
Watch out.
It'll be easy.
Aphres.
Tom passed away.
Did anyone get hurt?
Don't shoot.
Tom doesn't wear a sign.
Sing with me.
Please, Tom.
I'm saying.
No one answered.
It's not bad.
Sleep tight.
Do you really want to know the truth?
Tom was never in my house.
Let's go.
That's enough lies.
You have the right to have your opinion.
It's very fun.
Be good.
Keep working.
Stop it.
Of course I can, even though I don't speak almost Shanghai.
I invested.
Let's find out how that works.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Be just.
When did you tell me?
Be reasonable.
Tom is a very self-consuming person.
Tom agreed.
We didn't get close.
There's a tall man in the audience.
I'll watch TV.
Wait for me next to the car.
Tom tried to speak French to the seller.
Even if we get so late, it won't bother us.
Ask Tommy.
Ask Tommy.
What a horror.
You know I'm in love with Mary.
I don't agree.
I want to make sure he's perfect.
Get in there.
Stay away.
Listen.
Does it look stupid?
Tell me.
What's your name?
We remember.
Running as fast as I could, I was able to catch my friend.
We're going to have fun.
Tom doesn't put a sign on his finger.
Stop.
I waited.
Something's changed.
Tom's on the run.
We waited.
Wow!
Everyone knew.
Sleep tight.
This box contains 5 seeds.
I'm against it.
Tom asked us to be patient.
I thought he didn't have the right to do that.
Tom smiled.
Don't pay attention to Tom.
It won't change anything.
No one has ever expressed a desire.
I have to be able to do something about it.
Think about it.
Don't look at them.
A lot of workers were missing their fingers.
Keep looking.
They were wandering.
Continue to weigh.
Can you speak French?
Look at us.
I can't stand it anymore.
Eat something.
Tom died three months before he graduated from high school.
Tom was born.
Tom and Mary ate in silence.
Welcome home.
Good work.
Join us.
Tom swims well than Mary.
Tequive to the right.
Be realistic.
Start again.
They all laughed.
I'd like to know how this happened.
Keep it.
Let's tell you why we came.
Anyway, thank you.
Yes.
Tom's with his mother.
Stay away.
They didn't know.
He was fast going home.
Don't forget.
You can't do it without me.
Please go.
I deserve more.
Give it to me.
Keep going, please.
You were supposed to be waiting.
Let's go.
It helps.
Now I have to see Tommy.
Forget him.
It's a good time today.
Do you know the name of Tom?
Don't cry.
Please sing.
Don't do this.
I don't know if he's got there or not.
You're so handsome.
Tom found out.
No one came.
What are you standing for?
Wow, no.
Tom answered.
Get up.
Tom called his neighbors.
Walk straight.
I'll see you at school.
Take him.
Tom and Mary are alone in the room.
My girlfriend.
Find this.
Let's do it.
Keep moving.
Hurry up.
Oh, yeah.
Even green concerns are infuriated.
Keep them.
I see.
Hurry up.
What are they waiting for?
Thank you.
What's the deal?
Go tomorrow.
Get up.
Say, "Please."
It's a bad herd.
We're trying.
Tom can go to the band any minute to hear how Mary sings.
Tom liked Australia.
Take the tools.
The tree is green.
Don't worry.
Read this.
Be content.
It was uncertain.
It'll stop.
Stay silent.
I think I left something in the audience.
One day you'll understand.
Do what I asked.
I'm scared.
It works.
Be careful.
Do you know Tommy's name?
Tom was crying.
Stay here.
The flowers are flowering.
That's a lot of jokes.
Bring me the file.
What happened?
The house is small.
Do you love your mother?
Come on in.
Tom wants a new car.
From:
Someone got mixed up.
Mary's old age.
Start singing.
Answer me.
It worked.
We forgot.
Wow, Sue.
Take a step back.
Sit down, please.
What difference?
A language is never noble.
They noticed.
Listen.
Tom came back to his room.
I still think you lied to me.
Keep working.
There's no problem.
End this.
Tom was fighting.
There are kids playing in here.
Think again.
When do you buy?
Don't do that.
There's no fixtures on it.
Why are we running?
Put your handcuffs on him.
They all laughed.
Let's talk about how this works.
Tom fought.
The dogs are screaming.
We spoke.
It happened.
Sit here.
Hold on.
Tom invited me to go with the movie star Mary.
Get ready.
Tell me what you're looking for, and I'll help you find it.
What?
All right, Tom.
Be sure.
Years have passed.
Get dressed.
Tom forgot.
I like it here.
If the snake is going to weaken my head, I'm going to drink a few soaps instead of this terrible drug.
Tom really respects you.
I said some things I didn't want to say.
Look here.
Good world!
I've never eaten horse meat.
Let's not talk long and act.
Do you want to see what the new device is like?
We were saved.
A taco.
Squeeze.
They kissed.
Tom and I will go together.
Marry me.
You better go home as soon as you can.
They say Tom Jackson is one of Boston's best lawyers.
Excuse me.
Stop playing:
They approve.
It's just your opinion.
Fill it with water.
You're the leader.
Tom begged us to be patient.
Healthy food is important to healthy body, healthy consciousness and the result of it is to have the best effect.
Hurry up.
He believed in the truth.
Tom looked at it.
Shampoo, please.
Stay here.
I'm not in a tent of detail.
Don't get up.
They all prayed.
They all started to laugh.
Tom was red.
No one asked.
Hurry up.
All right, Tom.
Come on, please.
Be honest.
We'll see where we're going.
Tell Tommy.
Write it down.
Write this down.
I looked there.
Keep it.
I live in Ewa.
I'll get in the car.
Take these.
You're running.
Don't fight.
You don't do anything besides eating.
Don't do it, Tom.
Find them.
Don't look at them.
They were on their way.
She got married last year.
Tom made a link to my website from his blog.
Stand still.
Let go of everything.
This is my choice.
Tom's gone.
Let's tell you why we came.
You're running.
That's another case.
Please sing.
Have you spent all night here?
You'll do well to pull back.
It's time to go.
Toulouse:
I doubt that's what happened.
Tell me what you're looking for, and I'll help you find it.
Stay away.
Keep them.
No one pays attention.
Stay away.
Come back.
Will you come for a minute?
Sing with me.
Tom often heard about Mary, but he hasn't met her yet.
Wait a minute.
Leave Tommy.
Let Tomie.
Stop shooting.
Creatines don't have teeth.
He's gone.
Don't move.
Tom heard.
Tom wanted to sleep long, but he couldn't.
Past:
Start here.
That's funny enough.
Be loving.
Be prepared.
Tom was breathing.
Tom broke up.
How many years have you lived here?
Does it look like animist?
Can you speak French?
Keep you warm.
I thought Mary still loved me.
Stay here.
It's really impressive.
I don't know.
Mary ran.
Try again.
I slept a lot.
I get it.
Forget Tommy.
Thank you.
Take him.
Sit down.
Don't yell.
Start writing.
Every man's work, whether it's literature, music, painting, architecture or anything else, is always his face.
A noise.
Everything's changed.
Ask Alex.
There's always options.
You were supposed to be waiting.
Let's do this.
I'm out of work.
What are you trying to do?
Stay here.
It helped.
Where are you from?
Keep digging.
I missed you.
That's enough of a debate.
I got it wrong.
Tweak.
Tom can go to the band to listen to Mary's song any minute.
It's cold.
Stop it.
We don't need Tom.
I finished my homework when you called me.
Do you have plans for tonight?
I'm not tired.
Keep going.
How amazing!
Prepare:
Tom was upset.
What's your favorite bird?
Tom is a very beautiful man.
Call us.
What about going to a movie?
Remember that.
These things are not mine.
We're lost.
Take me.
Call me.
He was screaming.
What's interesting?
Who died?
Stay here.
It's easy to say, but it's not easy to do it.
Don't look at Tommy.
Sit down.
Sustained food:
I'll try again.
Tom's gone.
We forgot.
Tom has to thank me.
I'll be right back.
Take care of yourself.
Hurry up, please.
Be loving.
A bomb.
Be patient.
Everyone was alive.
Speak clearly.
He tried.
Gather yourself together.
Speak clearly.
It's hilarious.
Who knows?
Sit here.
Most of all, I love apples.
I'm connected.
Do you have a more detailed map?
I got a message from Tom.
Tom looked into Mary's eyes.
Tom paid.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
The bread is fresh.
I want Tom to be killed.
Tom died.
Please specify the conditions for your use of this information.
Be reasonable.
After you.
I just ignore them.
What does Tom read?
Look at that first.
Stand still.
I can do the math.
Don't worry.
Protect yourselves.
You've had patience.
Everyone sees a dream.
Thank you.
Tommy went to the hospital.
Keep talking.
I forgot.
Listen to me.
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Find this.
Let's go a little bit further.
Finish this.
Open fire.
Is there any details about Ellie?
Tom is much stronger today.
Fire.
Excuse me, can I leave a message?
Take me.
Please come and give me a year.
It'll be wonderful.
I'm drinking milk.
Squirrel.
It can't be late.
Keep reading.
Even if he doesn't come, we have to start.
Don't get up.
Tom was asleep.
Tom can't accept your gift.
First Tom hated Boston.
It's offensive.
Everything's changed.
Tom heard how they named him.
Stay away.
Tom's dead.
Let's face it.
Tom looked at his watch.
Speak loud.
Ask different people.
The wood is burning.
Let him go.
Tom doesn't have time to talk to you right now.
Be respectful.
Stop arguing.
I can't let you do this.
Please don't mention my name.
Gather yourselves together.
It's nice to see that girl.
You're doing something right now?
Seventy-eight years is the normal length of human life.
Forgive me.
Call me.
Hurry home.
Sit down.
Stay seated.
Don't move.
Is there a man in the house?
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Use the warning tools.
Speak loud.
Well, I'll see you.
Tell Tommy.
Did I leave something open?
Tom knows.
The snow came.
You can't do it without me.
That's a lot of bruteness.
Tell everyone.
Speak clearly.
Answer me.
When did you tell me?
Would it be normal if I sat here?
Keep writing.
Tommy seemed to be adorable.
I'm sorry.
Be careful.
Keep trying.
Come back soon.
I'm sorry.
The decision was made.
My knife is a sword.
I let Tom out.
I get it.
That's right.
I'm drinking tea too.
Tom stood there waiting to cross the road.
I just want to have a chance to apologize.
Be careful.
I don't remember what I ate last night.
Find it.
Ask Tommy about it.
Do you think I should do that?
Tom ran away.
Turn off the fire.
They submitted.
Tom boasts of his new car.
Change your shoulders.
Time ran out.
Tom would like to go to Mary's night. Unfortunately, he had other things to do.
Take these.
Keep smiling.
I can always sleep anywhere.
How deep?
Start now.
Tom laughed.
Tom smiled.
I woke up.
Let him go.
Let's get a little closer.
Let it go.
I'm sorry enough.
Do you have a date?
Don't worry.
Tom came out.
Tom won.
Tom disappeared.
Stay positive.
We're hoping to get back in time.
Tom advised Mary to go as soon as possible.
Be focused.
Tom will die again.
Keep fighting.
Say it.
Remember that.
Listen carefully.
He helped.
You're a lot of talk.
Don't go in.
Take it away.
Tom worked at the hospital.
Tom wrote a very detailed report.
These details will not be published.
They were all amazed.
Welcome to Wikipedia
Does anyone know whether the dining room is open or not?
The woman's in the room.
Take him.
Tom's trying to put up a hard time with smoking.
Keep running.
He wants to drink a little hot milk.
Wait, please.
Help me.
You're doing something right now?
What?
I like to be sad, and I know that most people are trying to avoid any kind of sad feeling, but I think it's wrong.
Round:
I have to translate the proposals.
How disastrous!
Everyone was waiting.
What a strange thing.
A bomb.
Hold on.
A man-to-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man.
It worked.
Be creative.
Take care.
Stay still.
What's the deal?
I confessed.
You have to sign this.
Be careful.
Let's go.
I don't care what you do with it.
Let's think about it a little bit.
Why didn't you write me?
Listen.
They were all shocked.
Get out of here.
Tom has a very creative spirit.
Stop.
Do you have an object on this plan?
Ask different people.
Tom failed.
Hi, Tom.
I'm sorry.
Be sober.
I didn't even think you liked Tom.
I love you.
You're yourself.
I'm going to have to do that.
I'm sorry.
Do well to pull back.
They cried.
Let's take a picture of my mother.
Hurry up, please.
I have two cats.
Don't say anything.
Please, stop.
What a tragedy!
We'll take a good time in Boston.
I'm lost.
He was running.
We understand.
Do you really want to know the truth?
Be careful.
Don't blow.
Smile at me.
No one died.
Tom helped.
Take this.
Grab him.
Italo Calvin returned to Italy when he was still a child.
What are you offering me to do?
Get in touch with Tom.
Start.
Don't shout.
What will one finally help or not?
You speak French?
Let him go.
Sign here.
Have you ever been to America?
Wait a minute.
Tom flew up.
Be careful.
Don't go after the silence.
Tom volunteered.
Why did you stop me?
It's an old name.
I know.
Don't blow.
I don't know anything about this.
I'm bored.
Thank you.
He's fast.
Follow me.
Good evening.
What's wrong with me?
Hold on.
Oh, my God.
Give this up.
Tom said he'd be a few minutes late.
None of my friends drink coffee.
Stay close.
Don't worry.
I don't have any more time to talk to you.
I can't think about what happened.
Eating:
Tom wept.
Stop talking.
Tom exclaimed.
Don't worry.
You don't know it anymore.
Let's go.
Chris is very attractive and rich, but not very modest.
Good dreams!
Choose carefully.
What's the deal?
Don't say anything.
(Laughter)
He worked.
Tom's drinking.
My mother was angry.
How old is your dog?
Tom was saved.
I love the Aquitaine language.
Tom's in a hurry.
Stop arguing.
Let's move a little bit.
Do you have a dictionary?
Let's go.
They shouted.
Get up.
Google Translate cannot translate expressions or define individual words.
Keep going.
Help me.
What's your favorite bird?
We wrote voluntarily.
Take Tommy.
Do it.
They're gone.
Take him.
Tom wrote this three weeks ago.
It really shocked him, and for some time he didn't want to talk about anything, and I think he'll spend a lot of time in a bad situation.
Stay tight.
I don't speak Japanese.
Tom doesn't know how to speak English what he wants.
Be respectful.
Tom says there's no problem.
Mr. Yoshidda has a very good head out of France's history.
Good year!
Follow Tommy.
Stop complaining.
Take it away.
Good.
Can you translate a scream?
Work hard.
We know all the details.
Keep writing.
One concern:
Come on.
I'm doing my lessons.
Stop laughing.
I don't imagine life like that.
Get out.
Thank you all for coming.
Tom was listening.
Write me.
Did you hear me?
He was working.
We're going to have fun.
Follow me.
I don't know the details.
Take Tom.
Tom smiled.
It happened.
Don't shoot.
Keep moving.
Tom called.
They were burned.
Let us go.
Get up.
Nobody listens.
Tom's driving a car.
They understood it.
Take this.
Thank you.
What?
Be careful.
What's not interesting about how much it's worth, and I'll buy it anyway.
Everything changes.
Watch out.
Take this.
We know.
I couldn't understand her thoughts.
It's noble.
They're cheating.
It's not easy.
Home phone call.
They rested.
Where did you send the parents?
Hide.
Have fun.
Tom sucked a cake for Mary.
We slept.
Except for us.
Here you go.
It's my greatest happiness to read.
It's a bad herd.
Excuse me?
Tom's not a fool.
Let's talk about how this works.
Tom wasn't happy to see that Mary.
I also drink tea.
Try again.
I agree.
Go ahead, please.
Please, listen.
I gave it to him.
Get up.
This works.
How many of you are there?
Look closer.
Tom needs to know what's going on.
She looks happy here.
The man sitting there is a famous singer.
Call us.
I can't entirely confirm the proposal.
I find it very easy to talk to Tom.
Someone called.
Everything's broken.
It's a horse.
I know Jimmy from childhood.
You have to sign this.
I thought he was coming.
Tom cheated.
He came.
She's coming to me.
Who are we going to give that to?
Watch out.
Tom said he'd help me.
Stop complaining.
I swore.
Stay left.
Come on.
There's another one.
Really?
Why are they so bad at us?
Stop shooting.
Keep walking.
I don't like silence.
Be careful.
You don't get this right.
Be compassionate.
Come on.
Say something.
Wait a minute.
Tom wants a new car.
Don't come close to your heart.
Tom saw Mary this week.
Silence, please.
There's a man working on the farm.
Bring me the file.
