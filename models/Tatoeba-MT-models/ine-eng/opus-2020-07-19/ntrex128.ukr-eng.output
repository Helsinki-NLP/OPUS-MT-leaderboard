Members of the Wells Assembly are concerned that they will “associate with maps”
Some CAs are threatening the recommendation to change the name of their post to "Member of Wells' Parliament".
This recommendation was based on plans to change the name of the assembly to "Parliament Wells".
THE whole political spectrum is concerned that it can cause smiles.
A CHA from the Laborists claimed that his group was worried about the Romans with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wells: in Welsh, "twp" means "unsubtle", and "pwp" means an act of defamation.
A.K.A. from the Wells Party said his group was completely "not satisfied" and offered alternatives.
One of the Welsh conservators said that his group was "unpredicted" about the name change, but noted that MWP could quickly become "map".
In this context, the word w is similar to the word yorkshiri.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently developing legislation to change names, noted: “The final decision on the new name of members of the Assembly will definitely be taken by the members themselves. ”
The Law on the Self - Control of Wales of 2017 gives the Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public discussion of the proposals, and the re-election of the assembly in the Wells Parliament received broad support.
With regard to what is called the CA, the Commission proposes to call them "members of the Wells Parliament", that is, WMP, but the MWP has received the greatest public support.
Of course, the CHA offers alternatives, but attempting to reach agreement can cause problems for the head of Elena Jones, who should pass the bill on changes for several weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules of the CA and the structure of the committee system.
A final vote on their new name will be held when the legislation is discussed.
Macedonians are going to vote on a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, the election will announce whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The vote was organized to resolve a multiannual dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Afghans have long claimed that their northern neighbour's name is a claim in Greece, and they have repeatedly opposed Macedonia's membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who is opposed to holding a referendum on the change of name, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, the proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that the change of name is simply the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's calls are silent, because Harlem's churches are experiencing difficult times.
“The old people I was talking to say that there was a bar and a church here before,” says Mr. Adams.
There's nothing now, nothing else."
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
"Today people are socializing differently.
Bars are no longer such a local guest room where they go regularly. ”
As for the churches, Adams is afraid that money from the sale of assets will not be as long as the leaders expect, and “early or late they will be found where they started. ”
The churches, he added, can replace houses with condominiums, and there will be people who will not help the saints who remain nearby.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white, ” Adams explained, “so this will speed up the day when all these churches are closed, because it is unlikely that the majority of those who move to condominiums will become their relatives. ”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: The Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Martin was ten years later.
Corinna, a white Methodist community, left here in the 1930s.
The black community, which was close to the ceremony, had the right to build.
St. Martin went to a black community under the direction of John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the various traders on 125th Street, Harlem's main trading street, and they didn't want to take on the work of blacksmiths and raise them in service.
In 1939 a fire damaged the building, but Father Johnson’s parishioners wanted to restore it and set up a carilion.
The late David Johnson, son and successor of Johnson’s father in St. Martin, proudly called the Carolina “the calls of the poor.”
The expert who played the championship in July called it "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng, from Michigan University, also noted that it was the first in the world to be played by a black-haired musician Dionysius A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to a larger colony in the Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merrieveger, in St. Martin, he had no replacements.
What's happening in Saint Martin over the last few months is a complicated story about architects and subcontractors, some of which have been joined by church leaders, others by the bishops.
In July, the Council, the governing body of the parishioners, wrote an eparchy that was concerned that the eparchy would “send out the expense” of the council, because the Council did not participate in the hire of architects and subcontractors sent by the eparchy.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the parishioner.
The shark was traumatized by a 13-year-old boy who was stalking lobbies in California.
According to official figures, on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him.
The attack took place about 7: 00 a.m. at the Bicon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego that in the morning of Saturday he's about half an hour late with his friends when he heard that the boy wanted help, and the group rushed to him to get out of the water.
Hammel first thought it was just a catch from the catchment of the lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, "I've been bitten!
They have tempted me."
As soon as he got to the boy, he saw that his key was completely broken.
"I called out to everyone to get them out of the water, "In the water of the shark!" said Hammel.
The boy was delivered to the Children's Hospital of the Council in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that has been attacked is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles at the media briefing told the media that a few weeks ago the shark was spotted in this area, but it was found that it was not related to dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had been injured by trauma at the top of the chest.
For 48 hours, the authorities protected access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swama in Ensinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to go to the British cosmetic market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with cosmetic islands similar to those in the universe.
In the context of a strengthened exit to the British cosmetics market of 2.8 billion pounds of sterlings (continued to increase at the time the volume of sales of clothing and household goods decreases) increased cosmetics islands will be protested in 11 stores across the country, and in the next year, if the idea is successful, the islands will appear in other stores.
Investment in cosmetics is that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the local space that used to be used on television, microwaves and household goods.
In Sainsbury's, they say they double the range of cosmetics and offer 3,000 products, such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees range will get more space: there are brand zones like those in Boots stores.
The supermarket also upgrades the cosmetic range of Boutique: most of the products presented will now not be protested on animals, as young buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the retailer of Fragrance Shop protests his batches in two Sainsbury's shops: the first batch was opened in Croydon, Northern London, last week, and the second one is opened in Sellie-Ouk, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and shopping for small quantities of food every day in small stores make supermarkets make additional efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Cupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that their stores would become more like the universe, because the supermarket network is trying to resist Aldi and Lidl discounts using a larger number of services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opens the Argos department in hundreds of its stores, also opens a series of Habitats departments. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claims that this increased sales of food and made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt to update the supermarket’s cosmetics and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended up after the dispute about how to split revenues from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its optical business (281 pharmacies) Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's network, for 125 million pounds of sterling three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help by adding an extended range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hex, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: "We have changed the appearance of our islands with cosmetics to make the atmosphere more pleasant for our customers.
We also invested in specialized consultants who could offer advice.
The brand range presented to us is called to meet any needs, and the pleasant environment and convenient location means that we are now a attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is a competition for the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "disgusting" because Holly Willowby made a deal worth 11 million pounds of sterling.
The Ligvo Dragon Star Peter Jones "students" because the Holly Willowby TV had come out of a deal with his brand of goods for life (the value of the deal is 11 million pounds sterling) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willowby doesn't have time for a brand of household clothes and True accessories.
The business pair was related to the Goop-Gwinette Peltro brand.
The 37-year-old leader of this Morning has announced his entry into Instagram.
Holly Willowby brought Peter Jones' Ligvo Dragon star to the story when she finally left their profitable business for life to focus on new profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources reported that Jones was "distorted", when a golden girl from the TV confessed at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the Johns Empire headquarters in Marlow, Bakingemshire, that her new contract worth 1.5 million pounds of sterling means that she no longer has enough time to devote it to their joint brand of household clothing and accessories True.
This business was related to the Goop Guineat Peltro brand and was to double Willowby's stock, which is estimated at 11 million pounds of sterling.
When 37-year-old Willowbie reported on Instagram coming from True, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was undoubtedly Holly’s main priority.
He was to become her long - term future in the next few decades.
Willowby's decision to get out of business shocked all the interested parties.
No one could believe what was going on on on Tuesday, almost a day before the start.
In Marlow's headquarters, a full set of items ready for sale.
Experts believe that the entry of this Morning leader, one of Britain’s highest - paying stars, could cost millions of companies because of large investments in goods (from pillows and towels to clothing and household clothing) and create further delays at the start.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willowbie’s children and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tari Kapp, for ten years.
Willowbie and Capp created True in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as the head of government in March.
The couple held a party together, Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s stock company, which is engaged in television.
Willowby will become an M&S brand ambassador and replace Anthony McCarterlin as leader of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
The source, approaching Jones, said last night, "We won't comment on him."
A rough conversation, "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he received from the news media for a comment that someone would consider as "unpredental", as well as a very positive attitude towards North Korea's leader.
"Why did President Trump go on such a big deal?
Tramp said, imitating the voice of the leader of the news. —
I didn't go any further."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June with a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have gone into the deaf corner.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the leading diplomat of North Korea, Ri Young Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "reaction" from the United States at its first steps to disarmament.
Instead, he noted that the United States continues to impose pressure - support sanctions.
Speaking at his meeting, Trump was much more optimistic.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea," he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have such a wonderful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had led to positive results: the completion of the missile tests, the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of US military personnel home.
He also protected his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave more Presidentially, but instead of 10,000 people on the streets trying to get into this battle of the hit stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed hundreds of islands
In particular, after the earthquake in Lomboca, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lomboki population have been affected, the national disaster has not been reported, which is a prerequisite for receiving international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they are not addressing international aid, so this is somewhat difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although "Let's save the kids" is collecting a team to travel to Paul, it's not known whether foreign personnel can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the national disaster relief agency, said that the Indonesian authorities appreciated the situation in Pala to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
Considering that earthquakes continue to take place in Indonesia, the country remains in a horrendous state of affairs.
In the province of Aceh, the deposits are built from the tsunamis, but they are not typical of the other coasts.
The apparent absence of a siren warning about tsunamis in Pala, although the warning was effective, likely contributed to the death.
Moving between many Indonesian islands is not just the best time.
Obstacles make logistics even more difficult.
The medical ship that was in Lomboca to treat the victims of the earthquake floats to Pala, but to reach the scene of the new disaster can be at least three days later.
President Joco Weidodo has improved Indonesia's infrastructure on the basis of his election campaign and increased the cost of roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has created problems for the administration of Mr. Joco, who plans to be converted next year.
Mr. Joco also avoids the duration of an interconfessional enemy in parts of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority chose a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, tens of thousands were evicted from their homes as a result of the opposition of Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using swords, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

The police called for a response from people who saw or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "Researching now at the early stages, but I'm asking everyone who was near John Street in Birkenheda and saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I also ask all, especially taxi drivers, who could take something from the video recorder, to contact us, because information on these videos can be very important for our investigation."
The police officer confirmed that the woman whose body was found was the residence of Birkenheda and was found in the house.
Today, in the second half of the day, friends who think they know a woman have come to a crime scene to ask where they found her this morning.

Cromwell's statue near Parliament becomes a new memory that suffers from "historic rewriting"
The removal of the statue would be due to the destruction in the Taliban-style of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, which were carried out by its fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Creek's proposal "stupid" and "the ability to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, said: “To sum up the current debate on the withdrawal of the statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster Palace was inevitable. ”
An iconocracy during English civil wars was not carried out by Cromwell himself or by his order.
It is likely that Cromwell was not to be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the past century.
The great statue of the sculptor William Hamo Thornichroft is a witness to the mood of the 19th century and a part of the story that many think is still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many are probably more likely to be in the late 19th century than they are now to be seen as the Cromwell advocate of parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Is such an idea entirely accurate — the subject of historical debates that persist?
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has identified the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the known figures that represents one side of this conflict.
Its achievement as a Lord Protector should also be noted and respected."
A Chinese farmer was beaten by a gunman to death
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by pigs on the market in southwestern China.
A man, identified only by the name of Juan, was found dead in blood with a broken artery near a pig market in Lupanshi Province, Guycheou, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In Sinina, China, on May 30, 2005, pigs are to be vaccinated in pigs.
It is reported that in the middle he left with his twin brother from the neighboring province of Greece to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the brother found him dead and saw that the door of the pigs was open.
The brother noticed that there was a large shed with blood on the floor.
The medical expert confirmed that a 249-kilogram cab had taken the farmer to death.
"The feet of my twin brother were in blood and confusion," said a twin brother with a name called Wu, quoted Guiyang Evening News.
The security footage showed that John entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to John or his twin brother.
The market manager told Evening News that when the police gathered evidence at the scene, the pig was locked up to prevent her attack on people.
It is reported that seven of me am Yuan and the market administration are discussing compensation for his death.
Even rarely, however, cases of swine fever have been reported earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked the woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and inflicted a severe injury on the man.
Ten years before that pig weighed 295 pounds [295 kg], she had a wheeled farmer pressed into the tractor until the farmer’s wife was afraid of the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can be a trigger.
"They're just playful.
They're like children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with proper respect," he said.
The remains of the hurricane will bring widespread floods to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening, moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the next few days, Rosa will bring rains with floods north of Mexico and south-west of the United States.
The rose had a wind speed of 137 km per hour (this hurricane category 1) at 5 a.m. on the east of Sunday and was 620 km south-west of Punta-Evgenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific begins to form an inlet that moves east to the western coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa approaches the Gulf of Lower California, like a tropical storm, it begins to push a strong tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25.4 cm [25.4 cm] of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then, in the near future, a tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching rainstorm will create strong floods in the southwestern part of the world.
From 2.54 to 10.2 cm [10.2 cm] of rain in this area will cause dangerous floodwaters, garbage streams, and the possibility of desert shifts.
Strong tropical humidity will increase the number of droplets to 5-7.6 cm per hour, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5-10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the south-west, especially in the large area of Arizona.
The rains of the forest are possible when conditions are severely deteriorating because of the widespread nature of tropical rains.
We strongly advise not to go to the desert of the foothills, for possible tropical floods.
Heavy rains can make the canyons stormy, and the forests bring the winds and dust storms here.
The closeness of the input will cause heavy rains in some parts of the northern coast of California.
The number of wastes can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause insatiable waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first left in the region in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical torrents will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, and the evening of Monday and Tuesday will be more extensive.
The strong rain will go over For-Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, intense temperatures across the U.S. territory may be observed, since the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropicals remain quite warm.
At times, this results in severe changes in the temperature at short intervals.
On Sunday, we will see a fine example of severe temperature fluctuations in the central United States.
It's almost a 7-degree difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and De-Mayns, Iowa.
During the next few days, the summer heat will try again to return and spread.
It is expected that much of the U.S. territory will be warm before October, and the temperature from the south level to some parts of the north east will be 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 12 degrees Celsius above the average temperature.
According to our long - term weather forecast, there is a high probability of average temperatures being exceeded in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Cavano’s hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people on six television networks observed the exciting testimony of a candidate for the position of Judge Brett Cavano and Christine Blaise Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence, as it seemed, in the 1980s.
Political opposition continued, channels were interrupting planned programs to report the latest news on Friday: a deal prepared by Senator Arizon Jeff Fleic, on a one-off investigation by the FBI on charges.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that she was 100% confident that Cavano was making her drink and trying to get her clothes off at a party at the senior school.
Cavano in his emotional witnessing said that he was 100% convinced that it was not.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people watched this Friday, as Nielsen's research company reported.
The company calculated the average audiences CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
It was not immediately possible to obtain numbers on other networks that also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has problems with measuring the number of people watching television in offices.
For comparison, such an audience in size is similar to an audience that looks at the player of the Playoff series or Oscar prize.
Fox News Channel, whose mind shows strongly supported the assignment of Cavano, was a leader among all the channels during the entire day’s hearing, with an average attendance of 5.69 million in Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3,26 million viewers.
According to representatives of Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after listening.
Flake became the central character of the Friday drama.
The office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he was going to vote for Kavana, and then on Friday morning CNN and CBS cameras recorded how protestors were shouting at Flake when he was trying to go to the elevator to listen to the Court Committee.
He was standing with his eyes out for a few minutes, during which he was licked, which was broadcast in a direct effervescent to the CNN.
“ I am standing right in front of you, ” said one woman.
You think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, "You have authority over women, and women are powerless."
Fleck reported that his office had published the application and, before the elevator closed, added that he would say more to the committee’s hearing.
All the cable and language channels conducted a direct broadcast hours later when the Judicial Committee had to vote on the nomination of the Kawano candidate to the Senate in full.
Flake said he'd do it only if he knew that the FBI would consider charges against a candidate next week, as a democratic minority demands.
Fleka was partly convinced of talks with his friend, Senator Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns and then with several senators, Felix made a decision.
Flekk’s choice had an impact, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to appoint a Cavano candidate without investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the charges against Kawano.
British Prime Minister Teresa May blames critics for "the games of politics" around Brexit
In an interview with Prime Minister Teresa May, Prime Minister of Sunday Times accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union in "politic games" with the future of Britain and national interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Teresa May came to a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview, which took place next to Teresa's interview on the first page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticised her so-called Checkers Plan on Brexit, saying that to propose Britain and the EU to impose on each other the "absolutely absurd".
Who shot Wade Sims: The police arrested Dayton Simpson for suspecting the death of a player at Louisiana State University.
Police arrested a suspect in a shooting that led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University.
20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and sent to prison for a second-degree murder charge, said the Baton-Russian police department.
The authorities posted a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to an affiliated CBS radio station WAFB, the police removed eyeglasses from the crime scene and noted that they had found Simpson's DNA.
Upon questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had confessed to shooting Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was assigned a deposit of $350,000.
The coroner's office of East Baton-Russia published a previous report on Friday, stating that the cause of death is a fire wound to the head and neck.
The Department expresses its appreciation for the special department for the search for Louisiana State Police, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the South University Police, and local citizens for assistance in the investigation that has led to the arrest.
The sports director of the University of Louisiana Jo Alleva thanked the local law enforcement authorities for “old age and desire for justice”.
Samsus was 20 years old.
By the age of 198, Forvard grew up in Baton-Ruz, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at Louisiana State University.
In the past season, the average result was 5.6 points and 2.6 points.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach at Louisiana Will Wade State University said the team was "depleted" and "shocked" with Wade's death.
"That's what worries you all the time," Wade said.
The volcano throws ash on Mexico City
The ash that throws away the Volcano Popokatepetl reached the southern parts of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Warning Center called for Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, since the crater was active and 183 gas and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was followed by numerous forests and ponds.
The pictures on social media show fine levels of ash on the lobby of cars in the area of Mexico, such as Cheimilko.
Geophysicists observed the increase in volcanic activity, 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital, after a 7.1 - magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
Vulcan, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police met with Catalan separatists before the year before voting for independence
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independence protestors met with a special police department, and thousands of people joined protests to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on separation.
A proseparatist group in masks held by the specialists threw them into eggs and powder, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that are usually full of tourists.
The clashes took place and later that day, the police used their thumbs to prevent aggression.
In a few hours' time, a group of independent supporters, who were running "We won't forget, we won't forgive!", met with supporters of the country's conservation who were shouting, "Hey, you live in Spain!"
According to local press reports, fourteen people were helped by mild injuries received during the protests.
A year after the October 1st referendum, recognized by Madrid as illegal, but marked by Catalan separatists, the tension in an independent region remains high.
The electorate decided largely to vote for independence, but the appearance was low, since the majority of those who opposed the division boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in severe trials last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting in polls throughout the region.
Independent groups spent a Friday night in tents to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to take another route.
68-year-old Narsis Termes, an electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
"We survived one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry for joy that they can vote, but now we're going to the deaf corner," he said.
Despite the vital but very difficult victory of the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan parties that stand for independence failed to preserve the momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders are in voluntary exile or imprisonment for their participation in the referendum and further declaration of independence.
Hoan Pueg, a 42-year-old mechanic who took a protest to support the police on the phone, said that the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
“Temployment is increasing, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders, who is in the next insulator of last year's isolation, announced that the next year he will be on his way to the European Parliament.
"The status of a candidate in European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression that we see from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: The men were arrested after the car went into the house.
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car drove home several times in London.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard-Crecent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in British standard time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings noticed that the door and the house had been damaged.
It is quite possible that at some point the car was fired from the arbalette.
Mangy's hit secured Lowington's victory over Rangers with a 1-0 account.
Dolly Mengae's first goal in Lowingston has become the winner
Raised in Lowington, Rangers surprised Stephen Gerard with a second 18-game defeat as Ibrax Club Manager.
The Dolly Menge hit proved decisive: the Harry Holt team rose to one level in a second from "Hibernian".
The Gerard team won no victory at the premier league of this season, and the next week, it's playing with the Harts leaders, from which it's left at eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will accept Rapid Vienna as part of the League of Europe.
Meanwhile, Lowington continues his invincible move to six games in the division, and Chief Coach Holt hasn't been defeated since Kenny Miller replaced last month.
Lowingston misses the chances that the guests are indigent.
The Holt team was supposed to be ahead of them long before they were killed, because their straightness creates Rangers all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but he struck the door, then Alan Litgou broke through the door after he rebelled and took the hit Craig Halket along the door that he had made with his head.
The masters were satisfied that they had allowed Rangers to play before them, and they knew that they could cause problems to the guests from the standard position.
A decisive target was killed.
Rangers missed a free shot, and Lowington made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson took over Mango, who took the ball and killed it from the crime center.
By this time, Rangers had been dominated by ball power, but the protection of the housewives had proved to be unbreakable for them, and the gatekeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
This trend continued in the second time, although Alfredo Morelos was able to hit Kelly.
Scott Pittman's impact on his legs was echoed by a Galliper Rangers, Alan McGregor, who hit Litgou by the door in another standard combination of Lionston.
The shuttles flew constantly into the Lowingston Penalties and were constantly neutralized, and two applications were rejected after the attack by Halkett on Glenn Midlton, who went on a replacement, and by the hand of the game.
Lowington phenomenon: analysis
Alastair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
It's a phenomenal game and the Lionington result.
They all played very well together, and they continued to exceed expectations for this excellent trajectory.
Their style of play and composition has practically not changed since they returned to the highest level, but they should be given to Holt for how he mobilized the command after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played a great deal, organized a very good defense, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to remain vigilant.
Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under the direction of Gerard, but now they are not very much involved in those standards.
They didn't get enough of the last ball -- only once they broke the housekeeper's defense -- and that was something like the Rangers Awakening thing that was in the middle of the table.
Erdogogans were widely accepted in Celia
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, there was a smile and a blue sky.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
There have been some disputes between them on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open up a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police didn't let 25,000 people meet in front of the mosque, but many of the president's supporters came closer to seeing him.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of them Kurds — also made themselves heard, condemning the politician Erdogan and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests testify to the inconsistency of the guest, which some German Turks called a hero and others as dictator.
Road accident in Depford: The biker died in a car crash
The driver died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the crossing of Bejudom Street and Evelyn Street on a live road in the district of Deptford in the south-east of the city about 10:15 a.m. after the British standard time.
The driver stopped, and the paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died.
This accident occurred a few months after another cyclist died after a flight from the resort to the Childers Street, about 1.6 km from the accident on Saturday.
The London police stated that they were working on establishing a man to inform his closest relatives.
Bus routes are banned and changed, and drivers are recommended to avoid this area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Prisoners Tragedy in Violations
Six prison staff were injured as a result of a man's incarceration, the prison administration reported.
Her Highness Long-Lartin prison in Woostershire began at around 09:30 in British standard time on Sunday and still continues.
The special section of Tornado was called for to stop the displacement, initiated by eight prisoners and located in one wing.
The officers were given medical assistance in connection with the slight facial traumas that were received at the scene.
A prison representative commented: "In order to resolve the incident in her Long-Lartin Majesty's prison, specially trained prison personnel have been involved.
Six employees received medical assistance in connection with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and that the length of their stay behind the bars may be delayed."
In her Highness Long-Lartin prison, more than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the chief of the prison had been sent to the station after the prisoner's attack.
In October last year, a special police department was called into prison to stop serious disturbances in which prisoners were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with lice.
Tropical depression rarely hit Arizona, but this could happen at the beginning of next week, since the remains of the hurricane of Rosa are heading south through the desert, creating the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of the flood on Monday and Tuesday in the territory from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Uti, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and Monday night will be rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have preserved the status of tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) from Phoenix since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) from Arizona.
According to the latest estimates of the National Centre of Hurricane, in the Mogollon-Rhym area of Arizona, it is estimated that between 5.08 and 10.16 cm and 15.24 cm of precipitation.
Other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are probably getting from 2.54 to 5.08 cm of precipitation, possibly up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of flooding, the rain of Rose may be a blessing, since the region is suffering from drought.
Although the floods are a very serious problem, some of these storms are likely to be useful because the southwest is now experiencing drought.
According to the American Dry Monitoring Centre, some 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers at least from extreme drought, which is the second highest level of drought, reports weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to the shifts in the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, on Sunday morning, still in force at a maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punt-Evgenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 19.3 km per hour.
Storms meet with colder water in the Pacific and are thus weakened.
Thus, the tropical storm is expected to cause a drought in Mexico on Monday or evening.
The number of falls in some parts of Mexico may be significant, causing a significant risk of floods.
"It is expected that the total number of precipitations from Lower California to the north-west Sonora will range from 7.62 to 15.24 cm, possibly up to 25.4 cm in places," reports weather.com.
Then Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the border of Arizona early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will continue through Arizona and reach south Utah late in the evening.
"The main danger expected of Rosa or her remains is very strong rains in Lower California, the north-west Sonora and in the south-west of the American desert," reports the National Centre for Hurricane.
These rains are expected to lead to life - threatening floods and waste streams in the desert, as well as droughts in the mountainous region.
An attack in Midsummer Norton: four men were arrested who were intent on murder.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspecting murder after finding a 16-year-old boy with a knife wound in Somerseta.
The early teenage girl was found in the Exxelsior-Terras area in Midsomer-Norton about 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained stable.
The 17-year-old, two-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested at night in the Radstok area, policemen Avon and Somerset reported.
The police are asking to answer everyone who can have any video of these events on the phone.
Trump says that Kavano is "tolerable of pride and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote for Judge Kavano is a vote against the ruthless and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wilingo, West Virginia.
Trump said Kawano was "tolerating pride and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of suspension.
Cavano witnessed to the Congress on Thursday, indiscriminately and emotionally, rejecting Christine Blaise Ford’s accusation that he had committed sexual violence against her for several decades when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave testimony to the charges brought against her.
On Saturday, the president stated that on that day “the American people saw the brightness, the nature and the courage” of Kawano.
"The vote for Judge Kawano is a vote for one of the most advanced lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a perfect experience in the public service," he said to a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president spoke of the Kawano uprising when he spoke of the importance of the Republican appearance in the Middle East elections.
"In five weeks, one of the most important choices in our lives will take place.
I’m not running, but I’m really running, ” he said.
That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump claimed that the democratic mission was to “stand up and prevent”.
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the candidacy of Kavana will take place no later than Friday, a CNN assistant from one of the Republican leaders reported.
Hundreds of people died from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims increases
At least 384 people died, many lost their lives in the ocean when the giant waves hit the beach as a result of intense earthquakes and tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the country’s government declared on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at the beach festival in Palu on Friday, when waves up to six feet (18 feet) in the pools broke down on the shore, beating many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunamis took place after the earthquake by 7.5 degrees Fahrenheit [7.5 ° C].
"When the tsunamis were threatened yesterday, people were still busy with their affairs on the beach and did not start to run away immediately, and they became victims," said a briefing in Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian disaster relief agency (BNPB).
"It wasn't just tsunamis, it was moving cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on the land," Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the shore line, the tsunamis passed through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 miles/h).
To save from the tsunami, some people entered the tree and survived, he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Pala.
The aerophotos, published by the disaster relief agency, show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are turned and destroyed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
Posts in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released as a result of a severe earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, located at the end of the long, narrow bay, could contribute to the strength of the tsunamis, the agency said.
Nugroho called the loss "wide-scale" and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found under wrecked buildings, he said, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were missing without a message.
Nugroho noted that victims and injuries could be greater than 300 km (190 miles) along the shoreline north of Pala in the area called Donghal, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"The lines of communication were completely damaged, and we didn't get any information," said Nugroho from Dongali.
More than 300,000 people live there, said the Red Cross, and it adds that its personnel and volunteers have moved to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it can get a lot bigger," the report says.
On Saturday, the agency received extensive criticism of the fact that it did not report that the tsunami had hit Paul, although the official officials said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In the amateur frames that people shared in social networks, it is evident that a man on the top of the house is horrified at the approaching noise of people on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, the wall of the water collapsed in the bank, taking the buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to verify the reality of the cameras immediately.
The earthquake and tsunamis have caused a serious power outage, which has disrupted connections around Pala, which has made it difficult to coordinate rescue operations.
Military personnel began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities reported, but evacuated people still need food and other items of primary importance.
The city’s airport was opened only for help, and it will be closed until October.
President Joco Weidodo was to visit the evacuation centres in Pala on Sunday.
The number of tsunamis killed in Indonesia is over 800.
It's very bad.
World Vision of Dongali’s co-workers arrived well into the city of Pala, where they hide in the tent of breezy set up in the courtyard of their office, but along the way they saw the scenes of desolation, said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw many ruined houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief efforts were initiated by relief teams, some complained that workers of foreign humanitarian aid with great experience would not be allowed to go to Paul.
According to the Indonesian rules, funding, supply and provision of personnel abroad can only start if the disaster area is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“ It is still a disaster at the province level, ” noted Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can accept international aid, but this status until it's given."
It was the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunamis, and the friends and families of those who had not yet found it were still hoping that the appearance of their loved ones would become a miracle that would adorn these clouds to bring about natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers received a woman who was lying under a stone for two days along with her mother’s body next to her.
Hendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian national team of paraplanetics, trained two missing paraplanetists to participate in the Asian games that had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paragliders who had fallen into a trap at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandaga, were his disciples.
"As an elder in paraplaneticism, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon relates how after a few hours of news about the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, which had spread among the paraplanetics, he sent a message to whatsapp opponents of Pala, who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked only by one gray branch, not by a double blue branch.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Stealing took $26,750 while filling the ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, a thief stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who ran a ATM in Newport on the Levee, reports Newport Police Department news.
The driver emptied the ATM into the fun complex and prepared to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man “runs behind to Brink’s co-worker” and stole a bag of money assigned to fill.
The Witnesses noticed a number of suspects fleeing the crime scene, but the police did not indicate the number of participants.
Anyone who has information about these people should contact the Newport police number 859-292-3680.
West Channel: the rapper changes its name to E
Reper Kanye West is changing its name to E.
On Saturday, when he announced a change to Twitter, he wrote: “It was previously officially known as the Kanya West. ”
The 41-year-old West was sometimes called Ye, and he used this abbreviation as a name for his album released in June.
The change took place the morning before his appearance at Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
On the show, he replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation because of "emotional reasons," the show's author said.
This is not just a shortcut to the current professional name, but West used to say that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I believe that "is" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West at the beginning of this year, discussing the name of his album with the radio-leading Big God.
So I'm you, I'm us, I'm us.
The canyon, which means "one", has been shortened to just E, it's just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
The canyon is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Paff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he chose the name Love and Brasser Love.
A former colleague of Westa, JAY-ZI, also experimented with defissive and large letters.
Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promises not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, promised never to use the army against the civilian population, and soon the country will mark the 50th anniversary of the wrong debate over the students.
On Saturday, Lopes Obrador promised “never to use an army to suppress the Mexican people”.
On October 2, 1968, the military shot a peaceful demonstration in the field, killing about 300 people, and the left student movement began to be established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to the learners and opening up more free state universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education lead young people to crime groups.
US should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
Since China is increasing its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. has to double the amount that they spend on research in this area, it considers an investor and a practice in the field of SC Kai-Fu Lee, who was working on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were made after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about the CIA, although there is no formal strategy in the U.S. area.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: It wants to become No. 1 by 2030 in the field of innovation in the CIS.
"Adjudication budget for the SCI research would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far away from the United States, and we are preparing for the next break in the SCI field," said Lee.
Double funding can double the probability that the next great achievement in the field of S.I. will be made in the United States, Lee said in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "The CIS States: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month, is the Director General of the Synovation Ventures Fund, which invested in Face++, one of the most famous companies in China.
In the 1980s, he worked at the University of Carnegie-Melone on the S.H.I.S. system, which played the best American player in Otello, and later he was the executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of the Google China branch.
Lee noticed the previous technological contests conducted by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when the next will be available to help identify future prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders, it's corporations," he noted.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies in recent years have been hiring a light from the University of S.H.I.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to increase efforts in the field of HIV.
"I think the Green Card should be offered automatically to the students in the field of science in the field of science," he said.
The State Council of China published its Plan for the Development of the artificial intelligence of a new generation in July 2017.
The National Fund for Natural Sciences in China provides funding to individuals working in academic institutions, just as the National Scientific Fund and other U.S. government agencies distribute money to American researchers, including the quality of academic work in China below, says Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence created a Joint Art Intelligence Centre, which aims to involve partners from industry and academic circles, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Art Committee.
This month, DARPA also announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
With regard to the National Science Fund, he now invests more than $100 million a year in the research of the CIS.
In the meantime, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to create the Commission from the national security of artificial intelligence, did not take any steps for several months.
Macedonians voting on a referendum to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to "the Republic of North Macedonia", which will allow for a multiannual dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's possibility of membership in the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the North Neighbor is a claim on its territory, and has put a veto on Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments established a treaty based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the agreement claim that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he wouldn't vote on the referendum, and because of the campaign, there's a doubt whether he's going to get the minimum 50% voter to consider the referendum real.
The questions in the Bulletin of the referendum are, "Do you support NATO and the EU membership in terms of the adoption of the agreement with Greece?"
The name changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay for accession to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young of Macedonia, so that she can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legal obligations, enough Members of Parliament have stated that they support it to make it decisive.
To change the name, two thirds of Parliament will be required.
The State Election Commission stated that no reports of violations were received by 13:00.
However, only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters threw their ballots into the mouth.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," declared 62-year-old voters José Tanevski in Skopje.
On 30 September 2018 in Stromica, Macedonia, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, his wife Zorika and his son Duško gave their vote on a referendum on changing the name of the country, opening the way for accession to NATO and the European Union.
Before Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Volodymir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proud head, not through the service door," Kavardrakov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can address others, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zayev believes that NATO membership will bring much needed investment in Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20%.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority is voting for, as more than 80% of our citizens are voting for the EU and NATO," Zayev said after the vote.
He noted that the result would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, 30 to 43% of voters will participate in the referendum, which is the most necessary event.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian telephony Telma shows that 57% of respondents are scheduled to vote Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote for.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the appearance should be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat at the referendum will be the first serious political impact of the Western government since its beginning in May last year.
Look, Sergio Aguaro from Manchester City is going through all of Breyton's defenses and is killing the goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling went through the Bryton defense and brought Manchester City a 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's goal at the 65th minute of the match looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine attacker received a passport in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Bryton defenders and was in the open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He went to one of the defendants, and then he ran a few more on the edge of the Briton.
Then he made the dog on the left, seeing Sterling.
The English foreward made the first touch on the penalty to hand over the ball Aguero, who, with his right butt, threw him into the right part of the gate, defeating the Briton Goliath Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some leg problems," said the reporters of the City Manager Pep Gardiol.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he killed a naked man at the moment."
But the initial advantage of the blue sky in this premier league has secured Sterling.
This goal took place in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a ball deep in Briton.
He sent a beautiful passing dog along the left flank of Leroy Sane.
Leroy made a few dots, and he followed Sterling’s dog in the direction of the distance.
The sky-block foreward threw a ball in the door just before he went outside.
The "Sites" will meet Hoffenheim in the group stage of the League of Champions at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhine-Neckar-Arena stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Shercer wants to take a look at Rokys.
Since the Washington Nashionals team was out of playoffs, there was no major reason to wait for the round start.
But the Shercer who is inclined to compete is hoping to go out to the Pitchers Mountain on Sunday in a match against Colorado Rockys, provided that Rokis is still in trouble with going out to playoffs. Now Rokis is playing one game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League.
At least Rokis has a wild card for winning a 5-2 on the Nashionals on Friday night, but they still want to secure the first division's title.
"Despite the fact that we're playing for nothing, at least we can leave the ball, knowing how the viewers here in Denver are doing, and the other team will probably play at the highest level I've seen all this year.
Why would I not want to participate in this contest?
"Nashionals" will announce who's going to be the first Pitcher on Sunday, but it's reported that they're inclined to be Shercer.
The Shercer, for which this is going to be the 34th start, took a pizza-session on Thursday and can play Sunday, usually the weekend.
The Washington right has a result of 18-7 out of 2.53 ERA and 300 strike cars in 220 2/3 inches this season.
Tramp Meetings in West Virginia
The president briefly mentioned the situation around his candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano when he spoke of the importance of the presence of Republicans' supporters in the Middle East elections.
"All we've done will be put on the map in November.
Five weeks later, one of the most important choices in our lives will take place.
It's one of the big, big ones — I'm not running, but I'm really running, so wherever I can, I'm fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "You see this horrible, terrible radical group of democracies, you see that it's happening right now.
And they're firmly set up to restore power, using any means, you see vanity, contempt.
They don’t care who suffer from them, who needs to be violated to gain power and control, they want power and control, we don’t want to give them to them.”
The democratic mission, according to him, is “to stand up and prevent”.
"And you see it during the last four days," he said, calling the democracies "bad and vile, ugly and false."
He mentioned the Senate Judicial Committee, calling Senator-Democratic Daian Finnstein on behalf of the audience for loud voices of discontent.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh-huh.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- it was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a large church.
It is intolerant to those who express their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it was almost a surprise.
Finally, I'm the last of those parliamentarians who have been told they're not happy, and that's all because we're expressing our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was almost the same because she was determined to oppose antisemitism.
I was convicted of not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
As for the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, these issues are ironically similar to those that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East team meeting said Friday: "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee in my eight-year-old capacity as a local member of the Parliament of Laborists were the same.
Unfortunately, today many meetings have a completely different tone, and the promise of a "more kind, more soft" policy has long been forgotten if it has been started.
It becomes increasingly evident that there are no different views in the Labour Party, and every thought is appreciated by the position it is acceptable to lead the party.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues with whom I had previously felt that I had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and take the position that I would never agree with, whether national security or the only EU market.
Whenever I go public — and it doesn't matter what I'm saying — there's a bunch of social network attacks, calling for a call, the center's policy conviction, I'm told I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I've been happier than some of my colleagues, because I'm usually focused on political comments.
I am attracted to the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face the daily flow of sexual or racist attacks, but never give up.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become a norm.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Labour Party should raise a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer such a broad church, and with every movement of "untrust" or change of party selection rules, the party is tied up.
Over the past two years, I have received much counsel, and I have been urged not to speak up, not to speak aloud, so that “all things are well with me.”
But I didn't get involved in politics.
I joined the Laborists 32 years ago, because because because of the lack of attention on the part of the Tettcher government, my class in high school has been literally distracted, since then I want to improve the quality of government services for those who need them most, whether the local councillor or the government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was concerned about my political views and differences with today’s leadership.
For those who have contributed to Friday's events, I just want to say one thing: when the country moves to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and state services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, I have another message, but not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, both members of the Labour Party and not for me: I am proud of what I serve you, and I promise that there is no danger of calling me back and no political advantage will make me act according to what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

"Eir" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Unforeseen "Eir" climbs up
The last two attempts, perhaps, have confused the final outcome, but the Air has undoubtedly earned a triumph in today's great entertainment match to the Premierschip of Scotland.
Now they're taking over the table, it's the only unconquered team of ten.
Finally, excellent defense and improved ability to use the opportunity gives Peter Merchi’s hosts and coaches the full right to be satisfied.
"We've been trying our games today, and we're still unattainable, so I have to be satisfied," he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose commented: "I see the right "Eir," they'd better use their chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute trial, carried out by Frasier Klimo, led by Air, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Guez, published by Verriers, allowed Melrose to show the figures, and Jason Baggot used an unrealized attempt.
Klimo increased Air leadership by using a pen and immediately before the break, made and implemented a solo test, which gave the 17-5 account for Air.
But Melrose had a good start on the second time, and Patrick Anderson's experiment with Baggot had reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a delay due to the serious trauma of Ruarid Knott, which was carried out from the field on the side, and the "Eir" restaurant went ahead by trying Stafford McDawell, which was implemented by Climo.
Captain "Eir" Blair McFronson then had a yellow card, and again "Melrose" forced another player to pay off Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt under a fiery pressure.
The masters returned, but when Stroan Hatchinson got a yellow card for the climo without a ball from the criminal scene line, McFerson made a tacdown behind the Air mill.
Clemo made the attempt that he did almost every time after the restaurant, then Kyle Row got hit by David Armstrong in the box and sent Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the master's team.
It looks like a star of the game series set up for a new career in the restaurant field.
It looks like the Ford Kiran's still playing star is set up for a new hospitality career, and this can be concluded once it's known that he's the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor, Jack Jarvis, is playing in a popular BBC television screenplay, a script he wrote and filmed with a former comedy partner, Greg Hemfil.
Duet announced that the future of the ninth series would be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirnan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he's the director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although the source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan wanted to enter the "excellent restaurant business" of Glazgo.
"Our Sea": interior camera Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling the fleet headquarters in La Pasi.
Public buildings hang the ocean blue flag.
Sea basses from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted by the currency: “Our sea is right.
We have to get him back."
In Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of a coast line that left Chile in the 19th century's curved conflict over natural resources, and there is a desire to sail back into the Pacific.
These hopes are now probably the strongest in the last decade because Bolivia is waiting for an international court ruling on October 1 after five years of trial.
"In Bolivia there is a impulse, there is a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, it expects a positive result," commented Roberto Calsaday, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the announcement of ICU's decision on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will take a decision for Bolivia that after decades of Chile's break-in talks, they will have to negotiate on Bolivia's sovereign exit to the sea.
Here Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his conversion next year, also puts great hope in a decision that will be announced Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly make a decision for Bolivia, and if that happens, there will be little change.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no authority to condemn the territory of Chile and has noted that it will not determine the outcome of the negotiations.
The decision taken by the ICU only six months after the final arguments were given indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Bolivia’s case did not continue, and the last four years could help to reverse the decline.
"The question of access to the sea was used by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
The military rhetoric of Morales undermined the rest of Chile’s kindness, which she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not been exchanged since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Wellts, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed with the fact that the court’s approval was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given “a unique opportunity to start a new era of relations from Chile and the opportunity to end 139 years of differences with mutual benefit, ” he said.
Calsaida also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America — used the maritime issue as a political force.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific, ” he added.
This is an opportunity to see that we should leave the past behind."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it can't trust the United States.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong Ho says his country will never give up its nuclear weapon first before it can trust Washington.
Rí took the floor on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to carry out the promises made during the summit in Singapore by the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments appeared when the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey seems to be on the threshold of relaunching nuclear diplomacy, which entered the deaf corner more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Chen Inn.
Ri says that the belief that the continuation of sanctions and opposition to the U.S. declaration of the end of the Korean War will once put North Korea on its knees is a “implemented dream. ”
Washington is afraid to adopt a declaration before Phanyan takes significant steps from the disarmament process.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second date.
But there is widespread skepticism that the Pyrenees take seriously the rejection of their arsenal, which the country probably considers the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phanyan next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
In the Paris fashion shows, the latest trend of massive major costumes is on the main streets of your city.
If you want to increase your hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you've found what's right.
Valentine's and Tom Brown's designers demonstrated a number of eccentric master clothes in the style of the summer-summer 2019 collection in the stages of a brilliant Parisian fashion week.
Very impractical hats filled with Instagram this summer, and so - called designers have already sent out their memorable creations beyond the horizon.
Valentino was seen as an extravagance runaway hat with wide decorated feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Among the other accessories are decorated with precious stones of cavée, chaplain hats and even hats of pineapple, but they're not for keeping their head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated an assortment of original masks — very timely before Halloween.
Many of these different color masks had protective lips, and they reminded Hannibal Lekter more of them than of a high fashion.
One creature resembled the underwater navigation system with the tube and the eyelids, another looked like a frozen cut that collapsed.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you're lucky.
The stylists say that giant hats can go out on the main streets of your city.
Overseas hats came into the fashion thanks to La Bombie, a solo hat with fields of 60 centimeters wide, which they saw at all: from Ryan to Emily Ratajkovsky.
A cult brand standing behind a very impractical hat that could be seen everywhere on social networks gave peace another creation: a salty beach bag of almost the size of a model in the bathroom that carried it.
The sum of the yellow-red rafiya with the rafiya bacrum and the white leather handle was the central element of the La Riviera Spring summer 2019 brand Jacquemus in Paris's weekly fashions.
Famousist Luke Armitaz told FEMAIL: "The next summer, I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of the city, because the influence of the designer is so huge that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for over-accessories."
John Edward: Knowledge of the language is mandatory for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools maintain high standards of education, and in 2018, excellent results have again been obtained, complementing individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
These schools, which teach more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are presented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SHRS) and aim to provide the best level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for the further and higher education they have chosen as their careers, as well as to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak with a person’s language that he understands, he understands it with his mind.
If you speak to her in her native language, she will accept it with her heart. ”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year’s exams, we see that in independent schools, languages lead to ratings of objects with the best estimates.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages received higher A.
Data gathered in 74 SRNA schools showed that 72% of the students received higher A from China, and 72% of the German students, 69% of the French students, and 63% of the Spanish students also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages to be vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as an object of choice is now being taught in the same way as the objects of the NTIM (scientific, technical, engineering, and mathematics), in independent school programs, and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the reasons why employers cannot close vacancies related to the lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in the preparation of young people for future careers.
Since more and more prospective positions require language knowledge, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if someone learned another language, he'd have a real advantage in the future, because it's a lifelong learning.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who has several languages the advantage over competitors.
According to a survey of YouTube, conducted among over 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75% could not speak in a foreign language well enough to support the conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a double - percent (15%).
That is why investment in language learning is now important to modern - day children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children more opportunities to find full - time employment.
In Scotland, each school will study its language.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for Britain from the perspective of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, you can always choose a few languages to study them with qualified teachers.
Scotland’s independent schools try to create an educational environment that prepares and equips children with the skills needed to achieve success regardless of what the future may have prepared them.
We cannot now deny that in the international business environment languages continue to have a vital role to play in the future country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be regarded as “the skills of international communication. ”
Independent schools will continue to give this choice, variety, and perfection to the Scottish youth.
It needs to be done well.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebanon debuts with Lakers in San Diego.
Fans who want to see LeBron James' first start for Los Angeles Lakers almost waited.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday in the first preseason match against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
How many minutes he'll play, it's not decided yet.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, told us that James, more than anything, would play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games of Lakers Preseason.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need preseason games," he replied.
Trump Meetings in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today launches a series of pre-election meetings from the city of Willing, West Virginia.
It's the first of the five scheduled for the next week of Trump's meetings, including meetings in friendlyly configured states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidacy proposed by him to the Supreme Court is postponed, and Trump wants to form support for the future Middle East elections, since Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress after the November vote.
What time is it going to be tonight's Trump evening meeting in West Virginia, and how do you view it on the Internet?
Meeting Trump in Willing, West Virginia, scheduled for 19 hours to spring today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch the Trump meeting in West Virginia online below in the direct eerie on YouTube.
Trump is probably referring to the tense hearings that took place this week with a candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano, accused of sexual harassment, and to the postponement of the Senate's vote for a week while the FBI's investigation is ongoing.
But the main purpose of this series of meetings is to help Republicans to gain popularity before the November elections.
President Trump's representatives said that these five meetings next week aimed at "the activation of volunteers and supporters, because Republicans are trying to save and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"Congress control is so critical to its agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible, because the tense pre-election campaign season is approaching," said Reuters, a representative of the Trump campaign, who did not want to call his name.
Today's meeting of supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News, is scheduled at the Vesbanco Arena stadium in Willing.
The Saturday visit will be the second one in the last month of the Trump visit to West Virginia, in which he won over 40% of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate from the Republican Senate to the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morris, whose polls are lagging behind.
“ It’s not good for Morris that the president is coming to raise his ratings in the polls, ” commented Reuters Simon Heather, a politician at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder 2018: U.S. team set up to fight and hopeful ahead of Sunday singles
After three sessions, which ended with a unilateral victory, the afternoon fortifications can become the same as that of Kubku Ryder.
An emergency pulser is a fully invented sports concept in which players really believe, especially in similar competitions.
So when they say the pulse is working?
"They were ahead at six points, and now at four, so I think we'll take it a little bit as a impulse," said Jordan Spit when he left.
Europe has an advantage, of course, on four fronts and twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spit says, feel a little bit of wind in their glasses, too much of them encouraging, not least the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each one made three eyes out of four.
The sleep with his killer hits from the tee-maidian to the border shows an example.
These shuddering shoutings of the celebration became louder when, in the course of his round, he made a decisive path and compared the account to the fourth match after he and Thomas were standing on two sides.
His duck, who allowed them to win the match on 15 August, met with a similar scream, which tells you the American team doesn't seem to be.
"You really just have to try very hard and worry about your own match," Spit said.
This is all that each of these players has left now.
18 moons to become known.
The only players with more points than Spyt and Thomas in the last two days — Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of Cuba Ryder.
It is unusual, but a wonderful couple from Europe have four out of four and cannot be mistaken.
Molywood was the only couple who didn't make the gods on Saturday after lunch, they also managed to avoid the gods on Saturday mornings and after lunch on Fridays and on Fridays at nine last lunches on Friday mornings.
This race and how their energy seems to flow to this noisy crowd back and forth, makes them believe that they win Sunday and that there will be no more popular players, except for Flethwood or Molinari, to strengthen the potential victory of Europeans when the sun goes over Le Golf National.
He wants both at the same time in different holes.
However, talk about the triumph of the Europeans as early as possible.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson argued with Sergio Garcia, a hero of the morning spells when he was in a couple with Alex Norren.
One god and two dolls on the first nine holes led the Spaniards and the Swedes to a hole from which they could never get out.
Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It is very interesting to observe closely the interaction between the participants, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and how the strategy can change in one moment.
Europe, while playing better than a team and has a great advantage over the last day, has also shown that the U.S. team intends to fight what some, especially Americans, are in doubt.
Europe leads with account 10-6 on the last day of Kubka Ryder
On the final day, Cuba's Ryder Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday's spells and forsoms it's ahead of the United States with a 10-6 bill.
Tommy Fleetwood's inspired duet and Francesco Molinari won two victories over the remaining Tiger Woods, and now on Le Golf National they have four balls.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to return the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning spells with a count of 3-1.
The U.S.A. has made greater resistance in the forsoms and has won two battles, but they have not been able to reduce the breakup.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points in 12 weekly singles to keep the trophies.
Flethwood is the first European novelty to win four sets of games, while he and Mollinary (also called "Mollwood") after the sensational exits are only a second pair that picked up four eyes in the first four matches in the history of Kubque Raider.
With Woods and Patrick Reid in the forebolts, they united to win the second Woods and the new American Brison Deshambo with even more effective 5th4.
Woods, who pulled out two matches on Saturday, showed a random flash of genius, but he immediately lost 19 of his 29 matchmates in the vortex and forsoms and seven matchmates.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning meal, returned to Henry Stanson's partner in the forsoms to get a 2t1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who is the first and third in the world ranking.
Europe has not been able to do everything in its power to this happy new day in the south-west of Paris.
Three major winners Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas set a standard for Americans on Saturday with their two eyes.
They won a decisive 2t1 victory over Spanish John Ram and Ian Poulter in the molds and later beat Poulter and Rory McClroy with an account of 4t3 in the forsoms, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Kubka Ryder team returned with a deficit in four eyes in singles, although the Furika team is only needed to save the trophies.
However, after the second place for two days, Sunday's contract looks like it's out of their hands.
North Korea says that "in no way" will not be armed unilaterally without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea announced on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions would increase confidence in the United States, and that under such circumstances the country could in no way refuse its nuclear weapon.
Ri Young Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea had used "essential measures of good will", such as the cessation of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of nuclear testing sites and the obligation not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"One day, we don't see a corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will never be the first to unarm ourselves in a unilateral order."
And although Ri reiterated the well-known North Korea complaints about Washington's "step-by" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea will be rewarded by progressive steps, his statement proved important that it did not avoid unilateral denuclearization, which was done by Phanyan in the past.
Rí referred to a joint statement by Kim Chen Inn and Donald Trump in the first story of the summit between the real president of the United States and North Korea leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim called for work on the "declarement of the Korean peninsula", and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea longs for the formal end of the Korean War from 1950 to 53 years, but the United States has stated that Pyrenees must first refuse nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes the call for a reduction in severe international sanctions for North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "denominations first" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve their goal violently, and even rejects "the declaration of the end of the war," Rí said.
“ Considering that sanctions can put us on the knees,” the unrealisted dream of those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases our confidence."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to the three meetings of Kim and South Korean leader Mún Zhee In over the past five months and added, "If the party to this issue of denuclearization were South Korea, rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have entered such a deaf corner."
Despite this, the tone of Ri's speech was markedly different from that of the next one when he told the General Assembly that the killing of North Korea's missiles in the U.S. capital was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "human missile", who wanted to commit suicide.
This year, in the UN Trump, which threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, Kim praised for his courage in using disarmament measures, but said that there was much more to be done and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea's denuclearization.
In the middle of the Trump noted that he did not set a time frame for this: "It will take two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council is to reward Pyrenees for the steps they have taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey stated to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions should continue energetically and uninterrupted until we see complete, final, confirmed denuclearization. ”
The Security Council has unilaterally increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to block the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles in Beijing.
Pompeo met Ri in the halls of the UN General Assembly and then said that the next month he was going to visit Phanyan again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompey visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Phanyan in July and commented that progress had been made, but after a few hours North Korea condemned him for “gangster requirements. ”
During this month's meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to break down the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States uses the "relevant measures".
He said that Kim said he needed the "appropriate measures" to guarantee the security that Trump had promised in Singapore and to take steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has given all of his students more sleep, and it's an attempt to fight the growing culture of the art of teaching all night after cooking caffeine.
The teacher found that students at the university number one in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very foundations of how to care for themselves.
Charles Chesler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Women’s Hospital in Brigham, has developed a course that he believes is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start a course after speaking with a lecture on the effect of falling asleep on learning.
At the end of the day, a girl came to him and said, "Why are you telling me this right now, in the last class?"
"She told me that nobody ever talked to her about the importance of the dream that surprised me," said a lecturer from The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains the basics of how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports outcomes and improve overall well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Harvard Medical Psychiatry and Executive Director of Medical Services at the University, said that the university decided to introduce a course after it was found that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The same course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a room in a group room where students click on coffee cups, dishes, trainers and books to learn about the influence of caffeine and light, the influence of sleep deficit on sports performances, and the importance of sleep-related routines.
Another section tells participants how long - term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the consequences of smoking cigarettes for health," added Professor Chesler.
The culture of pride for “sleeping all night” still exists, he added, and noted that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
A sufficient sleep of good quality must be the "secret weapon" of a student to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, even with a set of extraneous weights, because sleep deprivation translates the brain into a mode of hunger that causes constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler to develop a course after he enrolled in one of his other courses last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will address all the graduates with a request for a similar training program for the arrival of a competitive institution.
Professor Chesler recommends that students be reminded of the need to lie down and to put the building and be aware of the harmful effect of the blue light, which is emitted by electronic screens and light-emitting lamps, and can disrupt the circular rhythm that causes sleep problems.
"Liveington" 1 - 0 "Randers": Mengy's goal was to upset Jerry's boys
Rangers have survived a chain attack of external sadness: the Dolly Mengy hit a different team, Steven Gerard, with a 1-0 break from Louiston.
The "Ibrox" team wanted to win its first victory in a foreign match after a February victory over St. John's, with an account of 4-1, but Garry Holt's team defeated Gerard as an 18-game manager. The "Jerard" team remained at eight points behind the Scottish Prime Minister Harts.
Manga killed seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers warehouse, which lacked inspiration, didn't look like it could compare the bill.
Now, "Renders have fallen to the sixth position, and "Liveington" has risen to the third, and by the way, only "Hibernian" is ahead of them.
In addition, Rangers may experience another discomfort, as Linenman Colum Spence was forced to treat the head wound after it was dropped from the guest sector.
Gerard made eight changes to the team, which had once been passing Air to the Dob of the Scottish League.
And Holt released the same "Levia 11," which took one eye to Harts last week, and was fascinated by how his proficient boys pushed rivals on every step of the way.
The Rangers may have been dominated by a ball owner, but Lionington was working more with the ball that they had received.
They were supposed to kill everything in two minutes of the game when the first dog Menga in the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit on the door of Allan McGregor, but the half-defender had lost this great chance by sending the ball over the door.
A deep, free hit by Keagan Jacobs was hit by Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgou hit the back of the tank.
Rangers really got control, but in the last third there was more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt that he should be entitled to a four - hour term after the meeting with Stephen Lowess, but the reference to Steven Thompson rejected the call of the Colombian.
Rangers were only able to make two hits on the doors in the first time, but Liam Kelly's former gatekeeper, Lassani Kulibali, and the Ovija Edjaria's peaceful hit, were almost uneasy.
And even though the Lionington goal was passed for 34 minutes, maybe the game was in conflict, no one can deny that they deserved it only by their hard work.
Rangers couldn't deal with Jacobs again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent a ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Mango for a simple ending.
In the end, Gerard replaced the Kulibali on Ryan Kent, and this change worked almost immediately when the Winger broke into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly crawled out of his line to lock him up.
However, Lionington continued to force guests to play the game that they like when Litgou and Halkett make one long dog after another.
The Holt team could have improved the outcome in the last stages, but McGregor well opposed Jacobs before Litgou hit the corner.
Glenn Midlton, an exchange in Rangers, made a later application for a fine when he met Jacobs, but Thompson took another look.
Almanac: Geiger Counter's inventor
And now the page from our Sunday morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago this day, and the time is coming... in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as the Geiger calculator.
From then on, Gaeger became one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example, in the 1950s called Coronado, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play suspiciously like cowboys.
The man said, "What is this?"
Rogers: "It's the Geiger counter that's used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earpieces on, you can really hear how the radiation affects the atoms in the minerals."
Evans said, "Well, it's gonna blow right now."
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name keeps on living.

A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the malignant cells that are part of the treatment
The method provides for the removal of the immune cells in the patient and their change in the laboratory.
Then these cells are able to "see" a protein, which is common to many cancer species, and then these cells reintroduce the patient.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes removing immune cells in the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that these cells can "see" the same thing for many species of protein cancer (HER2), and then reintroducing these cells in the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States Institute of Cancer Betesda, Maryland, noted: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine. ”
"HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer," he explained.
A similar approach, which is to remove immune cells in patients, and to "teaching" them into cancer cells, has worked to treat one of the types of leukemia.
After appearing in the SNL show at the MAGA Canye West baseball studio, he gave a loud speech in support of President Trump,
caused by the negative reaction of the audience
Viewers at the SNL (Saturday Night in the Direct Efa) studio brought up Kaniya after his trashy speech, during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he was going to fight for the presidential post in 2020.
After performing the third song, called Ghost Town, in baseball, "Let's Return to America's Former Fame," he exploded with a terror in which he criticized the Democrats, and again declared his support for Trump.
"Sometimes during the conversation, white people ask me, "How do you like Trump? He's a racist."
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch by Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Cavano's testimony, which he gave to the Senate's Legal Committee on the Call for Christine Blaise Ford on Sexual Violence.
Although the West’s talk was not broadcast directly, the video with its tirade featured on the social media of the comic book Chris Rock.
It's just hard to see if Rock wanted to detach the West by placing this post.
West also complained to the viewers that he had been hit by an unpleasant situation because of the main suit.
As Washington Examiner reports, West said, "When I was behind bars, I was rudely treated.
I was told, "Don't go out to the viewers in this baseball game."
They've been bullying me!
And then they tell me that I'm in a place where the oppressed are silent."
The West continued, "Do you want to see where the oppressed keep quiet? I'll put on my superman baseball because no one can tell me what to do, do you want the world to keep moving forward?
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to a weekly Variety, his comments at least twice caused a negative reaction to the audience in the hall, and the SNL actors seemed to be ruined. One of the viewers said, "The studio had a dead silence."
In the last minute, the vests were invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Macmiller, died a few days before the show.
The West called in a lot of surprises by performing song I Love it (I love it) in Perrier's water bottle suit.
The West supported the leader of the conservative TPUSA Candes Turner, who wrote in Twitter: "One of the bravest: I'M WRONG FOR YOU WHAT I'M DOING TO NATAVPU."
Instead, Karen Gander's lead show wrote in Twitter that West is "who he is, and it's just wonderful."
"But I'm NOT going to reward it (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art") who, in my opinion, bears witness and utters an ideology that harms my community.
He is a free man.
"As we did," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced in Twitter that he had changed his name: now he's "the one who's known as the West Canyon."
The West is not the first performer to change his name, and he follows the example of Didi, also known as Paff Didi, Paffi and Pi Didi.
A colleague-reper Snoop Dogg used to be called Snoop Lion, and, as you know, the music legend of the last decades of Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then became "Artist, formerly known as Prince."
Indictment for intentional murder after a knife attack at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after another man's knife wound in one of the restaurants in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The police reported that the incident occurred at the Belligekamor restaurant.
It is expected that the accused will be brought before the court of the Belfast Magistrates on Monday.
The prosecutor's office is investigating the charges.
Kit Herington's Star Series condemns the idealization of brutality.
Keith Gerington became famous for the role of a warrior with John Snow's sword in the brutal medieval fictional series "Game of thrones" of the HBO.
However, a 31-year-old actor spoke with the condemnation of a hero-match stereotype, claiming that because of such heroes on the screens, young boys often seem to have to be cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he said, "Something has gone wrong," and asked how to solve the problem of the idealization of brutality in the age of #MeTo's popularity.
Keith, who recently married his colleague for the Grey thrones, 31-year-old actor Rose Leslie, noted that he was "very determined" to deal with this problem.
"I'm pretty determined at the moment, when we're on the path of idealization of brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their growth because of the prism of the problem that we see now?"
Keith believes that television is partly responsible for the popularization of brutality through images of extremely brave heroes.
He went on, "What's natural, what's planted?
Why does television and street teaching that young boys feel pressured to be such men?
I think the really important question today is, how can we change it?
'Cause it's obvious that young boys have gone the right way.'
In an interview, he also noted that he would not be filmed in any of the preschools and bicycles of the Games of the thrones after the show of the series next summer, because he had already finished the battles and the horses.
In November, Keith will play the play "True West" by Sam Shepard, a story about the filmmaker and his brother-in-law.
As the actor recently confessed, he respects the meeting with his wife Rose, the best he's ever had from the game of the thrones.
"After taking pictures of this show I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and determined my next life," Keith said.
In a fictional series that won Amy's awards, Rose played Igritt -- the love of Hero Gerington John Snow.
The ceremony took place in June 2018 in the territory of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a sharp increase of 14% in new cases of disease
In China, 14% of people with HIV and AIDS have reported a sharp increase.
According to health authorities, more than 820,000 patients are generally accounted for in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases of disease were reported.
In most cases, the disease has been transmitted by means of a sexual procedure that shows a change in the previous trend.
For a long time, in some regions of China, HIV spread rapidly through infected blood during transfusions.
However, according to official health authorities at the conference in the province of Junan, the number of people infected by HIV in this way has declined almost to zero.
However, compared with the previous year, the number of HIV - AIDS patients in China increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but the LGBT community often suffers discrimination.
According to the survey, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sexual relations with other men are further married to women because of the country’s conservative values.
In most cases, transmission of the disease occurs as a result of improper use of protective equipment during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV drugs, thus partially solving the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the abuse of the Republican senators' data on the network by her staff member and exposes the harsh criticism of the "dangerous lie" and the "conspiracy theory"
On Saturday, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Maxine Waters condemned a loud statement that one of her officials had posted personal data of three American Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims that these statements are spread by the ultra-right political viewers and websites.
"A lie, a lie, and then a more disgusting lie," said Waters in Tweeter.
The public information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Getch from Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday, and they were posted by an unknown person from the Capitol at the hearing of the Senate commission for charges of sexual misconduct brought against Brett Cavano, a candidate for the position of the Supreme Court of the United States.
The outcome came shortly after the three senators questioned Cavano.
The Hill reported that on conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, there was information that the source IP address is linked to the Waters office and that it was able to find the data from its staff member.
"These baseless statements -- absolutely false, they don't answer the facts," Waters continued.
"The contractor of my office, whose personal data and security have been put at risk as a result of these manufactured and false claims, has no relation to the source of this information.
These unsubstantiated statements are absolutely false, they're not true."
Waters' statement was quickly criticised in the network, and among other things the former White House Press Secretary Ari Flyerser also spoke.
"It's a denial of anger," Flyers wrote.
"It suggests that with that nature she cannot be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of what he has not done, there is no need to be angry.
The accused should not act presumptuously.
He should not ask about the motives of the accused.
He must remain calm and unmoved."
It seems that Flyscher had a parallel between the reaction of Waters and the criticism of the democracies to Judge Cavano, who was accused of looking too angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republican Party, who is struggling to occupy Waters in the middle of the election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"This is so news, if it's true," he wrote.
In her application, Waters noted that her office had already informed "the relevant state authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false statements".
"We will do everything we can to find the guilty," she continued, "and they responded to the law for their actions that are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
A review of Agent Johnny English: New Mission -- a passing parade of spy fighters with Rowen Atkinson
It's already become a good tradition to look for ideas in every new British movie, which was invented by Brexit, and they're also part of a new series of comedy parades on Johnny English fighters.
Will it be a ridiculous and ironic self-satisfaction to what we are short, the new export potential of the nation?
By the way, Johnny English with his movable face and his disillusioned eyes the second time had the opportunity to make trouble, with his name more than anything else indicating that this comical character was created for viewers in non-English countries.
As is well known, Johnny is a cheerful secret agent who, despite his strange efforts to be gallant and charming, is a little from Inspector Clouseau, a little from Mr. Bin and a lot of things, from the guy who played one note of the song from the movie "Fire Wheels" at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
A model of character is also a travel companion and a mystery of an international scale that always left behind the disorder that Atkinson had once played in Barclaycard's long forgotten television commercials.
In the last video about Johnny English, there are a few good points.
I liked the scene when Johnny English in his hunting gear approached the helicopter, and the gins of the gins were crambling about his helmet.
It's a very nice film to have Atkinson's talent for buffooning, but the mood is transient, and in some moments it's too much, especially when it's compared to "serious" movie brands, such as "Agent 007" and "Mission is impossible," one of the "integrators" which is also a comedy.
It seems to me that jokes are more about children than about adults, and I don't seem to be the kind of inventive and thoughtless behavior that comes with Johnny English, like Atkinson's in the blind movies about Bin.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
In the British supersecretive spy network, the hacker penetrates and exposes the names of all field agents, which became a complete surprise to the active agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an epic role in the film).
This was the last drop for Prime Minister -- a proud person who has already suffered a destructive criticism and is in deep depression because of the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried to give the best of the picture published by Teresa May, but the script failed to fully discover it).
Researchers informed her that all active agents had been compromised, and she had to be approached by someone from a distance.
The selection falls on the unsurpassed Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in a super-modern institution and informally teaches children operational work under cover (in this part of the Spanish "year" school, English for teenagers was a few long jokes).
The English are quickly taken to Whitegol for a term briefing, where he meets his long - suffering friend Buff, who plays Ben Miller in the back.
Buff is now married to the captain of the underwater boat (the role of an excellent nurturing person does not entirely correspond to the talent of Wiki Pepperdine).
So when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty went to Scarebert, "Bethman and Robin" returned in a row and suddenly met a fatal woman named Ophelia Pistoletto, who was playing by Olga Kurileenko.
And then the Prime Minister falls under the charm of a charismatic billionaire who has earned his fortune in the field of technology and technology and claims that he can remove the problem with the British network, the charismatic Jason Walt, who played Jake Lacey.
The English and Buff go on their journey, and they go back to their smiling performances: dressed by the officers, they fire in a hot French restaurant; they continue to sow chaos, illegally going abroad on the luxury island of Walt; the English is making a real mess when trying to use the helmet of virtual reality to get to know Walt's planning.
All the stops lead us to the final episode, but he reminds us of a movie for children by his kindness and folly.
It's a passing movie.
As with the other movies about Johnny English, I asked myself the same question: Can't the British movie industry offer Rowen Atkinson a role that really meets his talent?
The labists refuse to prepare a plan that says that British will work four days a week, but they'll get paid in five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbin has to discuss a radical plan that British people will work four days a week, but they will be paid in five days.
It's reported that the party wants to oblige the company's managers to transfer the costs saved by the artificial intelligence revolution, to the workers, giving them an additional outcome.
In this way, workers will have a three - day weekend, and they will pay the same wage at home.
According to sources, this idea will be the economic program of the party and will direct the country’s resources to support the working class.
The four-week shift was approved at the British Congress of the Three Unions, and this is how workers can benefit from a change in the overall economic situation.
The Labour Party's source reported the Sunday Times: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
It's not going to change in one night, but the idea of a four-week working week is the party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of workers, as well as the overall industry strategy of the party."
The Labourers did not first approve this idea, as the Green Party promised to conduct a four-day work week even during the 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, not all members of the Labour Party now approve of such a desire.
Speaker of the Labour Party said, "The party's political programme does not provide for a four-day work week, so we're not going to consider this idea right now."
"Tynn" Chancellor John McDonnell introduced his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at the first election in the Labour Party last week.
Mr. McDonnell said he had set up to withdraw power from the "uncertain directors" of municipal enterprises and "survivors".
The "dark" chancellor plan also means that shareholders of the water supply company can not get their full share of the capital if the lobbyist government conducts the "review" on the basis of imaginary violations.
He also confirmed the intention to include employees in company management and to create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of ordinary shares to private sector firms that expect annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell us at the 60-minute show if the investigation of the Kawano case, led by the FBI, might change their mind.
In connection with the investigation of charges against Judge Brett Cavano, who leads the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as Judge of the Supreme Court has been postponed for at least a week.
At Sunday's 60-minute show, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
During the hearing, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Kavano.
I called him after everything happened and the charges were dropped, and I asked him, "Did you really do that?"
He was decisive, firm, uncompromising."
It seems that Greem's idea will not change anything.
"I believe that the Kavana indictment is a provocation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know what: Brett firmly denied everything," added Graham, addressing Christine Blaise Ford.
And anyone she calls can't confirm it under oath.
That happened 36 years ago.
I don't understand what can happen."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and how can it influence poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival (the World's Citizens' Festival), an annual event in the music world with an amazing number of star performers and at least a thrilling mission, to combat poverty worldwide.
At the seventh Festival of Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to the Great Central Park branch, not only to enjoy the talks of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendez, but also to pay attention to the real purpose of the festival – the organizers will want to combat the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international public organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you don't want to pay a VIP ticket), visitors must do a lot of jobs or "acts", such as learning in a volunteer project, writing an e-mail to the world leader, making a phone call or anything else to help pay attention to the organization's goal of eradicating poverty.
So are there any results already, since the goal of Global Citizen organizers has been 12 years?
Is the idea really to reward for doing a free concert -- the brilliant way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clitivism" when people feel that they really change something by signing an electronic petition or making a publication on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million "actors" of their supporters aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have moved world leaders to declare planned financial allocations and programmes of more than $37 billion, which will help to change lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group provided an example of the results of its 390 financial commitments and public statements, with at least 10 billion already being collected and spent.
According to the group, the cost has already directly affected some 649 million people worldwide.
Among the main financial commitments are the The Power of Nutrition fund, which is territorially related to Britain. Under the project, investors and realists have committed themselves to "helping children grow" and have promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help cope with the malnutrition after more than 4700 messages from Global Citizens have been received in Twitter.
"To support the government of Britain, the Mesenatas, the governments of other countries and the citizens of the world, such as you, we can make a social problem of undernourished by a minor fact of history," said The Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman, a representative of the organization, speaking in public at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 "acts" that called for better nutrition for mothers and children, the UK government announced spending on the Power of Nutrition project aimed at improving food for 5 million mothers and children.
In answer to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you can tackle the extreme level of poverty?"
Global Citizens wrote, "This is a long and difficult path, so sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the participants in civil rights movements and against apartheid to us, we will achieve success because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, The Weekend Group, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Jeannell Mona, is just a part of the star performers that will be held this year at the New York Festival, and will be hung by Deborah Lee Ferns and Guy Jackman.
Minister of Interior said that the United States could use military and maritime forces to "block" to prevent the export of Russian energy
According to the U.S. Minister of Interior, Ryan Zinke, quoted in Washington Examiner, "for the sake of necessity" Washington, can be approached by military and maritime forces to prevent the rise of Russian energy to markets, including the Middle East markets.
Zinke stated that Russia’s participation in the conflict in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, is an incentive to explore new energies.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to be the middle of energy trade, as they are already doing in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
According to the employer, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"With the U.S. military and maritime forces, it is possible to provide a free passage through the seaways and, as necessary, to block them so that Russian energy resources do not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants in the event, which was conducted by the Consumer Energy Alliance (Energy Consumer Alliance) -- a non-commercial organization that positions itself as "the voice of every consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare trade approaches with Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually similar.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia is generally that we effectively use energy resources and replace them with alternatives," he said, calling Russia "one-sided", because its economy depends on mineral sources.
While these claims were being made, the Trump administration aimed at increasing the export of compressed natural gas to Europe by pushing the Russian energy market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
For this purpose, members of the Trump Administration and President Donald Trump themselves are trying to convince the German government to reject the "unprecedented" project of the Northern Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a facilitator of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 is worth $11 billion, which doubles the existing gas capacity to 110 billion cubic meters -- an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington is fighting the project for only economic reasons, which is an example of dishonest competition.
"In my view, we share the idea that energy cannot be a pressure tool and a consumer should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry, who took place in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position triggered a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German lead organization of the German Federal Industry Association (BDI) called for the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when a third country is involved in our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of German Industry, after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "seriously thinking" about the 2020 presidential round-up
The senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that "he's thinking seriously" about going to the president's office after the interim elections.
At a meeting with the public in Goliak, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the possibility of attending his candidacy.
As The Hill Warren reports, "It's time for women to go to Washington and set up a government, and for that to happen, there must be a woman."
"On the 6th of November, I'm seriously thinking about moving my candidacy to the post of president."
At a meeting with the public, Warren expressed his appreciation of Donald Trump's presidency, saying he "did not lead his country in that direction.
"I'm extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was open, criticizing the Trump and offering him a candidate for the position of the Supreme Court judge, Brett Cavano.
On Friday's tweet, Warren wrote, "...no doubt the FBI should be investigating before the vote."
However, according to the polls published on Friday, most of Warren's voters do not believe that it should be fought in 2020.
In line with the results of the survey conducted jointly by the Political Research Centre at the University of Saffol and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the state's potential voters in Massachusetts expressed their opposition to the senator's candidacy.
Thirty - two percent supported the move.
The survey found that the former Governor, Deval Patrick, was more supportive. He was 38%, compared to 48%.
During the discussion of the nominations of other well-known democracies, which can be fought in 2020, they also refer to former vice president Joe Baiden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Byden stated that he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Pailin mentions PTR Trek Pailin during a meeting to support Donald Tramp
26-year-old Trek Paylin spent a year in Iraq after entering military service in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son is going through right now, what he's going through after he's back, can only be understood by other families that are experiencing the effects of PTR and other health problems that our soldiers are returning home," she told participants in the meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tals, Oklahoma.
Pailin called Trek's arrest "a problem that no one pays any attention to" and said that her son and other war veterans "are not returning home as they used to be, more cruel, and they want to know if they respect here what they have done to their pick-up soldiers, pilots and other military personnel for this country."
According to a spokesman for the Vassilla Police Department, Dan Bennett, Treka was arrested on Monday in Vassilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence and assaulting women, as well as of obstructing reports of violence and carrying arms in a state of alcohol abuse.
18 States and the Columbian District Supports the Defamation of Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the province of Colombia support the accusation of a new U.S. policy that the victims of gang persecution and domestic violence refuse to grant refugee status.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the district sent an analytical note to a court consultant in Washington to support the caller who needed shelter and complained about the policy in court.
The full name of the appeal in the case of Grace v. Seshens, after the call of the American Union to protect civil rights, in which the federal policy is being accused and which was filed in August, is not being disclosed.
The invitation stated that her partner "and his cruel sons-in-laws" had beaten her, but the U.S. officials refused her when she asked for shelter on July 20th.
She was illegally kept in Texas.
Public prosecutors who support Grace said that the people of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (who often seek refuge in the United States) often face serious problems, such as gangs and domestic violence.
The new policy of granting refugee status is repealing the 2014 Immigration Appeals Council decision, according to which non-documented immigrants who have escaped domestic violence could apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia, General Carl Reisin, said in his speech on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring the decade of state, federal and international laws."
"Federal law requires that the decision on the application of refugee status be based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and that the prohibition violates this principle," says the Court's consultant's review note.
In the review report, prosecutors further argue that a policy that prohibits immigrants from entering the United States would harm the economies of the country, since they could potentially become entrepreneurs and "fill the necessary labour resources".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Seshens issued an order for immigration judges, stating that they could no longer give refugee status to those fleeing from domestic violence and banditism.
"The protocol is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with racial ownership, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views," Seshns said in his speech on 11 June.
The provision of shelter was never intended to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people all over the world face each day.
Rescuers desperately try to find those who are left alive, while the number of those who died in Palus has increased by two.
For those left alive, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with a nightmare at the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Pala.
"Every minute a quick help brings the body.
Clean water is not enough."
Some people return to their ruined homes, take advantage of the incinerators, and try to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals damaged by an earthquake, with an estimated 7.5 degrees Fahrenheit [7.5 ° C] being overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including two Geriss with a fracture of the back and shoulder, rest at the building of the Pala’s army hospital, where patients are helped under the open sky through continuous retrieval.
His eyes were filled with tears when he remembered how a strong mail rushed into the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for salvation.
I think I've been trapped in the wall," Heris told Associated Press correspondent, adding that he and his family had come to the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help, and then she sighed quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador blames China for the psychological pressure of advertising.
A week later, after the Chinese State newspaper posted on the four pages of the daily U.S. paper ad on the mutual benefit of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread the propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump of the Middle Ages sent a payroll supplement to China Day's Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa after the prosecution of China, in an attempt to influence elections to the Congress on November 6, China rejects these charges.
According to the U.S. agency Reuters officials, Trampa, in which he charges Beijing with attempted involvement in the U.S. elections, is a new phase of Washington’s escalation, a target of pressure on China.
Although foreign governments can place advertising to boost trade, there is a escalation of trade wars between Beijing and Washington over time, where they have already raised import duties.
According to experts from China and the U.S., at the beginning of this war, the introduction of a repressive customs in China was aimed at striking exporters from such states as Iowa, who supported the Republic of Trump.
Terry Brenstead, a US ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural production to China, said that China had done harm to American workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Brensted wrote in a column on the Sunday issue of Des Moines Register, "is increasing the pressure by publishing a advertisement containing propaganda in our independent press."
"To spread the propaganda, the Chinese government has used the road for the American people the tradition of freedom of speech and the independence of the press by placing a paid advertisement at Des Moines Register," Brenstead wrote.
"On the contrary, on the streets here in Beijing, you will only find different voices, and here you will not see a true picture of what the Chinese people actually think about the direction of the Chinese economy, which is causing concern, so you can conclude that the Chinese media are under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the important Chinese editions offered to publish" his article, but he didn't call it what it was.
Analysts warn that by the failure of the Kawano Republicans, women voters are setting up against themselves before the mid-term elections.
Since many well - known Republicans support and protect the candidate for the position of the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano after he has been charged with several charges in sexual harassment, analysts warn that this may cause an unwanted reaction to the pre-trial interim elections, especially in women.
In this situation, prejudice is rampant, and most Republicans publicly claim that they would like to go to the poll.
These things can't just be played back," said Grant Riger, professor of politics at Maxwell University of Syracuse, during an interview with The Hill on Saturday.
Riger expressed doubts that the FBI investigation, at which the last minute Senator Jeff Flake (Republic of Arizona) began to press, would be enough to calm the angry voters.
According to Washington, D.C., the main advisor and spokesman for the MoveOn Group (Move forward) Katrin Jean-Perry said on Friday: "Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget about it tomorrow or November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning the protestors sang "The Fall is coming!" during a demonstration in the Legal Committee, when the Republicans decided to move to the approval of the Kawano candidate, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
In an interview with the news website of St. Rothenberg, a post-partisan political observer, he said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"They're saying it's true now, and it's true.
However, motivation may be enhanced, especially in women voters 18-29 years of age, with priorities that have not yet been defined and often do not vote unless they like the president."
Before Ford gave a witness in connection with the applicant's charges against the High Court's office in sexual crime, analysts predicted the negative voter response if the Republicans insisted on a statement.
According to NBC News, earlier this week's former head of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Michael Steel, said, "It's an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
As stated in an interview with the news channel, Director Priorities USA (U.S. Priorities) (a group that assists in the pre-election campaign of Democrats) Guy Cecil, "the case is not in the vote of the committee, the final vote or that the Kawano was in the lobby of the defendants, and how they responded to this situation and how they acted on it."
Yet, the American’s views on whose testimony to believe, Ford or Cavano, have been divided, with a little more support for Ford.
According to a new survey by YouTube, 41% of respondents believe or believe in Ford, while Kawano believes or believes 35%.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents said that they thought that Cavano had given or had given false testimony rather than anything, while about Ford said the same thing to 30% of the respondents.
According to The Guardian, after Fleek F.B.R.'s pressure, he conducts a review of the charges filed by Ford and another caller, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under the oath of the Senate's Legal Committee about how Kawano attacked her while she was in a state of alcohol abuse when she was 17.
Ramirez stated that a candidate for the position of a judge of the Supreme Court showed her her genitals at a party during their education at Elsa University in 1980.
A world-wide Internet inventor plans to launch a "new Internet" to create competition for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the global Internet, launches a new startup to create Facebook, Amazon and Google competition.
The latest project of the world's technology legend, the Inrupt company, is to develop a platform with an open source code of Solid, the idea of which belongs to Berners-Li.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where to store data and who to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Li, he joked that the goal of Inrupt is "world rule."
"We should do it now," he said about the start-up.
It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable users to create "Personal Online Data Storage" or POD.
It can store contact lists, mailing lists, calendars, audio recordings library, and other tools for your own use and work.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in one browser at a time.
The unique feature of this personal online data repository is that it fully meets the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it "the expansion of personal capabilities through data".
According to Director General Inrupt John Bruce, the company aims to operate resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is made up of Berners-Li, Bruce, security platforms acquired in IBM, several state-owned developers hired to work on the project, and the volunteer software community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether to make a full replacement when all their business models undergo radical changes within a short period of time.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a Saturday publication on Medium Berners-Li, he wrote that the mission of Inrupt was "to secure commercial energy and the ecosystem and to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet network by establishing a Global Pavilion Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee is an influential figure in the debate on net neutrality.
Even at the launch of the Inrupt Bernards-Li, he remained the founder and director of the World Pavilion Consortium, the Fund of the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next era of network development," said Bernards-Li.
Bernard Vann: Celebration from the inauguration of the Church of the Order of "Christ Victoria" in the Year of World War I
The only representative of the Anglican Church who received the Order of "Christ Victoria" for the participation in the battles during World War I is honored in his home town 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Vann received a prize for his participation in the attack under the Belgian and Leucour on September 29, 1918.
However, he died four days later from the sniper tower, and he never learned that he had received Britain’s highest military award.
On Saturday, his two grandsons discovered a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rassden, the county of Nortgemptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, called the "extremely symbolic" that the discovery of a memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather accomplished the tribute that he received.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Vann transferred his battalion through the St. Katen channel "through a very dense fog and under the heavy fire of field weapons and bullets."
Later, he rushed to the firefront and with the "sudden horridness" he made a sharp advance, before which one broke into the field gun and destroyed three enemy sub-units.
Lieutenant Vanna shot the German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little more than a month before the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Vann said that his grandfather did what he could never do himself and deserved respect.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, put the shadow after the parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he feels very proud of being involved in this parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero demonstrates the respect that so many people show him."
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead showed them "Peppo Pig"
Imagine that you don't sleep all night just to watch the events of Bellator 206, and you're denied the opportunity to review the main event.
There were 13 battles in San Jose, including six main program units that were broadcast live in the nighttime in Britain on 5 channels.
At six o'clock in the morning, just before Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were ready to get together, TV viewers in Britain died of a miracle when on the screen, instead of broadcasting the war, Peppa's pig appeared.
Some observers were not attracted to this because they did not sleep until the morning before waiting for the battle.
One of the fans wrote in Twitter that switching to a child's movie was "some sort of failed joke."
"According to a government decree, the content broadcast at 6 a.m. was inadequate, so they were forced to release a child's transmission," said Dave Schwarz, the senior vice president of the marketing and public relations of Bellator, when asked about the TV,
"Peppa pig," yes."
Bellator Scott Kocker, president of the company, promised to work on a broadcasting schedule to catch up with visitors in Britain in the future.
"I think if we talk about retransmission, we'll be able to set it up," Cooker said.
"But now there's Sunday, 6:00 in the morning, and we can't do anything until we have Sunday, and they have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was turned off, we received a lot of the messages that we responded to, and the text of these messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical flaw, and we tried to remove it.
However, it was found that this was not in conformity with government regulations.
I can promise you that's not gonna happen anymore.
We're going to cut the tournament down to five fights instead of six, as usual, and we're trying to reinstate the signal for fans, but until we put these tests off.
It's a really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dale felt worse than others because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic stripper in the water, Tom Dale, tells us that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that "not all look like him," until he went to high school.
Taking part in the Desert Island Discs transmission on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he noted that he openly spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also stated that because of parenthood, he had become less concerned with winning the Olympics.
For a long time, the director of the program, Kirsty Young, went to the hospital for a few months.
When he came as a couple to the first Lavern program, Dale said he felt worse than others when he was a child, because "the society didn't accept when someone liked boys and girls."
He said, "By this time, the feeling of inferiority and difference was what gave me strength and strength to achieve success."
According to him, he wanted to prove something "wary," not to disappoint all those who finally learned about his orientation.
The twice-a-thousand bronze Olympic champion became a well-known fighter for the law of the LBGT community and was used as an event at this year's Societies Games in Australia to encourage more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke openly about his views, because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this "hope" to others.
The world’s triangular champion confessed that his feelings for a man, American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, were a real surprise to him.
Dale took Oscar’s award winner, who was 20 years older than him, last year, but he said that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you're going through so much at this young age" (in the first Olympic games he was dating at 14 years of age, and in three years his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who would also survive the likes of flying and falling.
In June, there was a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and since then, according to Dale, his "acceptance" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd just think about what you should get the gold," he said.
"You know, there are things much more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dale said that his father could not reconcile himself with the idea of the end and asked if they had bought the tickets at the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't sit in the first row because you won't be next," said Daley.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Dale joined the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: to pry in front of my fellow students at the Olympics, and there was no feeling better for it," Daily said.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song — Proud (Gordia) in the performance of Gizer Small, which resonates with him during the preparations for the Olympics and still calls for ants.
The Desert Island Discs program goes to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m.
On Saturday with the winner of the Cup Rider tournament, Mikelson was released, who was not in shape.
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th game at the Cup Rider tournament, but he has to restore the shape so that this event doesn't get miserable for him.
Mikelson, who took part in a two-year-old tournament on record 12th, took Captain Jim Furick out of the game during the vortex and forsams.
Instead of staying in the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, a five-time winner encouraged the team all day and trained on the side, hoping to get rid of emotion.
Because Mikelson wasn't famous for his good hits even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old sportsman didn't come up with a difficult field for the Le Golf National golf course, where the Raf usually punished for the wandering hits.
And if that's not the case, on Sunday's 9th season, Michelson will have to meet with the champion of the Open Championship and the master of the exact hit of Francesco Molinari, who won all of his winners this week in a pair with the novelty of Tommy Fletwood.
If the Americans who stay three points after the 12 singles start well, the Mikelson match can be decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his sportsman, and he probably had nothing to add to it.
"He finally understood his role today, blew me in the back, hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furick said.
"He does not doubt his powers.
Michaelson, a member of the Hall of Fame, who did so much for the teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play in two matches.
I predicted more fighters, but that's how it worked, and that's why we decided to do it.
He wants to be there, in the field, like anyone else."
If Mikelson goes out on Saturday, he's gonna beat Nick Faldo's record, who played the biggest match in the Cup Rider tournament.
He may have completed his career at the Cup Rider tournament, which has never met his individual achievement.
On Michaelson’s 18th victory, 20 defeats and 7 zero results, however, Furick said that his presence could play a crucial role for the team.
"He's funny, he's fat, he's fat, he likes to joke with others, he's a guy who's classy at the team," Furick explained.
"I think the younger players were having a good time coming to him and this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He's more than just a player."
Captain Thomas Byrne of the European team knows that the big drain is not going to solve anything.
Thomas Beorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great breakthrough in front of the lone players on the last day of the tournament for the Cup of Raider does not yet guarantee victory.
Datchanin won in 1997 in a match at the Valderram Club, where a command at the head of his Ballesteros ahead of the Americans at five points, but won the match with a minor draw with the result of 141:13 1⁄2.
"You remember that we had a big kick in the game in the Valderrams field; a big kick in Bruklayna where we lost, and in the Valderrams field where we won the game," said Byorn after viewing the winning games Class 2018 with the result of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at the Le Golf National Stadium, after which the kick is 10.6.
So history teaches me and every player of a team that has not yet been decided.
We have to play with the maximum performance tomorrow.
Get out of the field and do whatever you need to do.
The game will be finished only after the result appears on the table.
We have the goal of getting this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said earlier, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are well aware of who opposes us -- the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of my players in the complex field, Byorn added, "I will never run ahead.
It'll be different tomorrow.
We're expected to have a single match tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's a classic playing field with a partner when things go well, but it's when you stand there alone, and you can check what you're worth as a golfer.
Here's how to configure players to speak tomorrow: on the edge of possibilities.
You leave your partner without support, and now he has to show you what he's capable of."
Unlike Byorna, the opposite number Jim Furick expects his best-playing partners to play on an individual level, with the exception of Jordan Spyt and Justin Thomas, who took three of the four.
For the last day, Furick returned to various sides: he was among the winners in Bruklein, but he was defeated when a team from Europe created the "Mude in Medina".
"I remember every goddamn word," he said in answer to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, organized the players before the last day of the game.
"We have 12 important winners tomorrow, but we need to start successfully as it was in Bruclain and Medina.
When the initiative moves to a certain side, players in the middle of the distance are under special pressure.
We put the players in the team, like we're going to, like, do something incredible tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead a counter-attack against Rory McCillroy, and then in the first half of the list of European teams, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fletwood, and Ian Pollter.
"Only these partners, and in that order, I have chosen because I want to make a balanced effort throughout the game," Bjorn commented on his selection of players for individual match-ups.
The introduction of a new German warship has been postponed
Germany's most recent military-sea fleet fragment had to be put into action in 2014 instead of the old Cold War courts, but local media reports indicate that this will not happen until at least next year due to inadequate systems and a sharp increase in costs.
According to the Die Zeit newspaper, received from the military intelligence spokesman, the launch of the Rhineland-Pfalz ship, the main ship of the latest series of Frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019.
This ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery had damaged the implementation of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg ships, which military and maritime knowledge ordered in 2007, have to replace the old bridges of the Bremen class.
Understandably, they will be equipped with powerful weapons, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some of the technologies that reduce sighting, including radiolocation, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is the long period of technical supplies, which is expected to be able to avoid returning to the base port for about two years.
However, journalists Die Zeit warns that because of the constant delay in the operation of modern military ships that were to strengthen the military power of Germany at sea, they will also become obsolete at the time of the operation.
The F125 heavy-duty frigate got into the headlines of the thoracic newspaper when the German naval forces officially refused to launch the ship and returned it to the Blohm + Voss Verf in Hamburg.
This is the first case of the return of the military ship to the shipyard after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned significant "programming and equipment defects", which made the warship unfit for military operations.
The lack of software is particularly important, since the crew of the Baden-Württemberg ship is made up of about 120 sailors — only half of the troops serving on the old bridges of the Bremen.
In addition, it has been found that the ship has a considerable excess weight that is worse than its operational characteristics and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
It's considered that the Rainland-Pfalz frigate is twice as heavy (7,000 tons) as the ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to wrong equipment, another problem has become the overall cost of the project, which also includes the cost of equipment preparation.
The expected $2.2 billion was turned into a total of $3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion).
The problems of getting new frigates have gained special weight in the light of recent warnings of the defeat of the German military and maritime forces.
At the beginning of the year, an authorized Bundestag of the Hans-Peter Bartels armed forces reported that the country 'was left with the WMS "a handful of ships capable of carrying out the war's tasks.
The officer claimed that the situation had worsened for some time, since the old vessels had run out of operation and the new ones had not arrived.
He expressed his deep regret at the fact that none of the Baden-Württemberg Frigates could complete the military-sea fleet.
The National Trust Will Observe the Secret Life of the Bats
A new survey carried out in the land-use area of Scotland's summit aims to establish how the bats use the landscape in search of food.
Scientists hope that the data received will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to carry out their conservation measures in the future.
In the gardens of Inver in West Rossi, scientists of Scotland's National Trust will observe such species as neteroir carlic and neteroir pygmie, as well as echoes of a normal and watery nightlife.
Special registrants will be placed in strategic locations in the landscaping area to observe the behavior of bats during the season.
Workers and volunteers of Scotland’s National Trust will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to establish the frequency and relevance of the shouts of the bats.
Then it is planned to develop a detailed animal residence map and prepare a report to link animal behavior to their habitat.
Rob Duar, a consultant on nature protection in Scotland's National Trust, hopes that research results will help determine which areas of life are most important to bats and how they are used in each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of environmental management measures (e.g., the formation of people) and identify the best conservation methods for bats and other related species.
During the last century, the population of bats decreased considerably in Scotland and in Britain.
They are threatened by the active construction and acquisition of areas that deprive them of their nesting sites.
Other negative factors include wind and lighting, rocking paper for flies, chemical processing of building materials, and domestic cat attacks.
The sentences are not actually blind.
However, by hunting at night, their ears are more effective than their eyes.
They use a complex ecolocation method to detect insects and obstacles to the flight path.
In Scotland’s National Trust, which is managed by over 270 historic buildings, 38 special - interest gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land all over the country, the problems of batons are very serious.
Ten specially trained experts carry out regular research, inspection of nesting sites, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's efforts have even created the first and only battalion container in Scotland, which is located in the territory of the province of Triv in the Damfres-end-Gallow area, where there have been shelters of eight of the ten battalions living in Scotland.
David Thompson’s manager said that it was a perfect place for them.
"In the territory of Triv's beautiful conditions for the batons," he assures.
"Here are old buildings, lots of giant trees and other pleasant living conditions.
But we still need to learn a lot about the bats, because of the research we're doing here and elsewhere, we're going to be able to learn more about what they need to prosper."
He insists that it is very important to check the territory for the presence of bats before performing any technical work, because because of the unintentional destruction of one nesting site for the young can kill up to 400 males with children, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
The punishment and their nests are protected by law. Animals are forbidden to kill, torture or disturb.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Conservatory Centre, urged the public to join the organization’s efforts.
She said, "We need to learn a lot more about our bats, and we haven't yet discovered the characteristics of the populations of many species."
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape, and his lawyers prepare appeals against German editions
Kristian Ronald called the charges of rape "incest" and said that people "try to pay attention," using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a call against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published suspicious information.
American Kathryn Mayorg accused the Forvard of collecting Portugal and the Juventus football club in a rape that took place in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
As Der Spiegel reported on Friday, Ronald apparently paid her 375,000 dollars in silence.
A few hours after the charges were filed, Ronald addressed 142 million of his fans in a videocast in Instagram, calling them "naklep".
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's accusations are slander," said a five-time gold baller in the camera.
"They want to draw attention to themselves, using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to take care of me, but similar situations are part of my work.
I'm a happy person and I'm fine," added the football player, smiling.
According to the information agency Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are preparing calls against Der Spiegel for published charges, which they called "an unacceptable message of suspicion in the field of private life".
A lawyer named Christian Shertz said that a footballer would claim compensation for "moral damage in proportion to the seriousness of a violation which is probably one of the most pronounced cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
It is claimed that the recorded incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting at a nightclub in Ronald and Mayorg, they returned to the player’s room, where he seemed to have been assaulted by the local court of Clarke County, Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident described by Ronald, he fell on his knees and said that he was "99 percent good boy," which he raised "one percent."
As noted in the documents, Ronald confirmed that he had sex with a model, but with mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and then to the hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later she agreed to a post-trial settlement because she was afraid of revenge and warned of "public humiliation."
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel the previous deal, as she continues to suffer because of an incident that she said had a place.
At the time of the incident, Ronald was preparing to move to the Royal Madrid FC from Manchester United, and this summer he became a major player of Italian football, Yventus teams, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will "defeat forever" about the loss of car manufacturers
Britain is going to be "damaged forever" if it loses its world leader's status in the field of auto manufacturing after Brexit, which is what the Minister of Economy Greg Clark warns.
He added that he was approved by Toyota UK, who reported to BBC journalists that in the event of Britain leaving the EU without agreement, the company would have to suspend its production and work in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," says Minister Clark.
The Japanese auto manufacturer stated that the consequences of delays on the cord in Brexit’s case could cost jobs without a contract.
The factory in Bernaston, where Toyota models Auris and Avensis are produced, released about 150,000 cars, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my view, if Britain is going to leave the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped," said Marvin Cook, Director General Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how Britain comes out of the EU without an international trade agreement.
For example, BMW stated that a factory from the production model Mini in Oxford would be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the automakers are that Brexit can risk supply chains without a contract.
Toyota's line manufacturer is operating in order to supply details and materials as needed – the details come every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for cars made on order.
If, on March 29, Britain leaves the EU uninhabited, there may be a gap in the supply of details that will lead to delays and material shortages.
As noted in the company, Toyota can be placed at least for one day, so production will have to be stopped.
Greg Clark noted that in the EU's plan for relations with the EU, prepared by Teresa May (Checkers Plan), "there are plans to avoid problems on the border."
"We need an agreement, we need to make an optimal agreement, which, in my opinion, will not only enable us to achieve success at the present time, but also make use of the prospects that have emerged," he said during today's BBC Radio 4 radio program.
"In view of the testimony of Toyota's representatives and other car manufacturers, we need to save highly efficient supply chains."
Toyota was unable to report how long production would be stopped, but in the long term, it is expected that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and, as a result, reduce jobs.
Peter Chowalaris, head of the United Professional Association at the Bernaston plant, which worked here for 24 years, said that other participants were extremely concerned: "I can tell from experience that the reduced jobs are not being restored."
The representative of the government said, "We have put forward a precise and reliable plan to shape our future relations with the EU."
The Trump and Rosenstein meeting can be postponed again, marked in the White House
As White House representatives reported Sunday, Donald Tramp's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "deposit for another week", as long as the discussions continue with Brett Kawano's candidacy to be held as a judge of the Supreme Court.
Rosenstein controls the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, the links between Tromp and Russia's assistants, and the potential violation of the judiciary by the President.
In Washington, D.C., a few months ago, there was a discussion of the possibility of release of a Deputy Attorney General who would put Muller's independence at risk.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had expressed his desire to use microphones to record talks with Trump and the possibility of the President's term of office in the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein didn't confirm this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House on the ground reports that the official is about to retire.
Instead of this meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York, it was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he wouldn't want to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate's Legal Committee, on which to testify to the Kawana and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaze Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into the charges against Kawano, which further suspended the Senate's vote.
Press Secretary Trampa, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News Sunday TV show.
When she asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date of the meeting is not scheduled, maybe it's going to take place this week, and I expect it to be postponed for another week, given all the cases related to the Supreme Court.
But let's see, I keep watching the press for the latest information."
Some journalists disagree that Sanders did not conduct a briefing for the media in the White House on September 10th.
The leader, Chris Walles, asked why.
Sanders replied that the occasional briefings were not about the incarceration of the public games on the part of television reporters, although she added, "I won't be able to deny that they were playing on the audience."
Then she assumed that Trump himself would communicate with the press more.
"The President answers questions more often than any president," she added, without referring to the source, "Statistics speaks for themselves."
Sanders noted that the briefings would always be held, but "if there's a chance in the press to ask the president, it's better than talking to me."
We're often trying to communicate with the press, and this should be particularly noticeable over the last few weeks, and the opportunity to talk to the President of the United States is not worse than the press conference."
The tramp regularly answers questions during operations outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences for high-level guests.
Press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why it was so, acting in front of journalists, and sometimes surprised.
State Secretary for Health Protection of Scotland addressed EU workers in a letter in connection with fears through Brexit
The State Health Secretary addressed the citizens of other EU countries working in Scotland's National Health Protection Service to express their gratitude for their work and ask for it to continue after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The government of Scotland has already made a commitment to cover the cost of the application for permanent residence status for EU citizens working in autonomous state services.
In her letter to Mrs Freeman, she said: "In the summer negotiations between Britain and the EU on the issue of exit took place, and this autumn we have to wait for the appropriate decisions.
But the British government is strengthening its preparation for a possible conclusion without agreement.
I know that this period can be very worrying for you.
That's why I would like to stress again how I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Fellows from all over the European Union and countries abroad share valuable experience and skills by strengthening and improving the health services for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we want you to stay."
Cristion Ebercromby underwent a terminal surgery after a head injury
Christon Ebercromby, a member of the Tennessee State Tigers team, completed a term operation after receiving a head injury in a Sunday match against Vanderbilt Komodores, who lost his team at 31:27.
The chief coach of the Tennessee State Tigers team told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
"He went to the side line where he got sick," said Reed.
On the side of the train and medical staff, Ebercromby was given oxygen before he was taken to carry it for further examination.
The official representative of Tennessee State Tigers reported to Chris Harris from the WSMV channel, Nashville, Tennessee, that Ebercromby was operating at the Medical Center of Vanderbilt University.
Harris added that "until there's a witness about the type and severity of the trauma." In the Tennessee State Tigers team, they're trying to find out when the player got the trauma.
Ebercrombi, a second-class student, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tigers after moving from Illinois.
He did five rounds of ball on Sunday before he got out of the game, so for the season he had 18 rounds.
Foreign buyers will pay more government fees if they acquire real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will pay more money in the event of the acquisition of real estate in Britain.
This west neutralises all Corbin attempts to join young voters
Higher taxes will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The Ministry of Finance is expected to add an additional 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
As Theresa May announced today, foreigners buying in Britain's real estate will pay more money, and additional costs will be spent on helping the homeless.
This step can be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to involve young voters in making promises to provide more accessible housing for highly-paid workers.
The increase in customs applies to the physical and legal persons who do not pay taxes in Britain. The additional costs of the government are directed to help those who are forced to sleep under the open sky.
An additional fee, followed by a two - year - old raise to the second house and the real estate assigned to the rent, may be three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to add an additional 120 million pounds a year.
According to experts, 13% of the new real estate that is built in London is owned by foreign citizens, which makes it difficult for people who just dream about their own home.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, are empty, since a large number of foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new plan of action appeared only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a lower government fee to make the home more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices for real estate by collecting land without any further use of it, and he urged Teresa May to refuse the quota for the real estate available to correct the "disgusting situation on the housing market" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of important reforms in the area of real estate, including the control of rent and the possibility of eviction without serious grounds.
He also proposes to extend the authority of local councils in the area of the construction of a new home.
Theresa May said, "This year I promised that I would dedicate my premierity to the restoration of the British dream - for every new generation of life should be better.
This calls for changes in our imperfect home market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
However, it is not fair to say that individuals who do not live in Britain as well as foreign companies buy housing under the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many people the dream of their own home has become unattainable, and the problem of living under the open sky is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "I want to be the head coach of Scotland."
Jack Ross, Chief Coach of the Sanderland FC, claims that "more than anything else" would ever be the lead of Scotland's assembly.
A 42-year-old Scotch has decided to restore the club from the north-east of the country, which now holds the third seat in the First Football League, with three eyes away from the leader.
Ross moved to the Stage of Light this summer, returning the last season of the Saint-Mirren FC to the Premier League of Scotland.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to Scotland's second assembly, but it's over," Ross told the BBC Scotland radio station during the Sports Sound program.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched Scotland's gathering at the "Gempden Park" stadium, which always attracted me.
The only hope for me is to be successful at the headquarters of the club's main coach."
Ross' predecessors at the Sanderland FC, including Dick Advocates, David Moies, Sam Ellardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kein, Gustavo Poet and Paolo De Canio.
The former FC chief coach Alloa Atletik claims that he did not feel the urge to go to a large club after having previously rejected proposals from FC Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"At the current stage, I'm going to think that I've succeeded if the club comes back to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and material security, this club undoubtedly meets the Prime Minister's level," he said.
"It will be a difficult task, but another result I will hardly think of as successful."
Ross has only been building a coach for three years, and he worked as a second coach at the Dambarton FC, and spent 15 months at the Garts FC training station.
Then he helped Alloa wake up after FK got to the third division, and next season, St. Mary ran from the flight stage to gaining the title of the first division winner.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his career in Clyde, Garthlpool, Folkerk, St. Maryn and Hamilton Academy.
"I've been to the station," he says, referring to the transition to the Alloa FC.
"I sincerely believed that coaching was more suitable for me than playing.
That sounds strange because I was successful, well earned, and reached certain heights.
But playing is not easy.
There are many challenges that we face each week.
I still face them with stress and stress, but as a coach, I feel at my place.
I've always been interested in coaching, and I've never felt so comfortable with my adult life since I chose this profession."

Research: 17:30 on Sunday is the perfect time for a beer cook
The summer heat has helped to boost the supply of British pubs that survive the worst times, but it has increased the pressure on the network of restaurants.
According to the calculations, sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7 per cent, while restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 per cent.
The author of Peter Martin, from CGA, who is consulting on business development, said, "Because of the sun's weather and longer than expected, England's participation in the World Championship, July passed the same scheme that the previous month, when the pub was raised by 2.8%, and the restaurant went even worse.
The red fall of 1.8% in July was increased.
The pubs and bars are oriented towards drinking while they have the best indicators — increasing their profits is equivalent to the loss of restaurants.
The pubs in which they feed also suffered from heat, but not as severe as restaurants.
It seems that visitors are interested only in drinking.
In sub-control pubs and bars, drinks increased by 6.6% per month, while food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst at the Department of Free and Cheap Business in the RSM company, noted: "We have been observing similar trends since the end of April.
Weather and large social or sports events remain the main factors that affect domestic sales.
It's not surprising that restaurant groups continue to lose profits. The annual sales drop of 4.8% causes a special concern about the need to cut costs.
The long hot summer wasn't the best time for food-supply bets, we'll see if the temperature we saw in August can give them such a necessary rest."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the market for new brands.
The Galluze volume of Coffer Peach Tracker sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants of the United Kingdom is a reflection of the collection and analysis of the productivity of 47 working groups, a total of over 9 billion pounds of sterling.
Every fifth child has an account in the social network hidden from parents
As research has shown, every fifth child, sometimes under 11 years of age, has a social network account hidden from parents and teachers.
Studies involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages in Instagram
This news raised concerns about the possible placement of sexual content
20% of students reported having a basic account showing their parents.
Every fifth child, sometimes under 11 years of age, creates an accountant in social networks that hides from adults.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages in Instagram — a social network for the exchange of photographs.
This news raised concerns about the possible placement of sexual content.
20% of students reported having a clean "basic" account showing their parents, as well as one or more privates.
The mother who happened to be on the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter saw the call "violate me."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) in private schools showed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles on social networks.
The head of the HMC Mike Bukenen Association said, "We're very concerned that many teenagers have a desire to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Ailid Doyle will be a "representative of the interests of athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council.
Ailid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as an independent director during the annual general board of directors.
Doyle, Scotland’s most famous light school, has been called this step a great opportunity for those taking the lead in sports to take advantage of the international experience that has been gained over the past decade.
"Eilide is used with great respect among athletes in Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that by joining her in the council, athletic sports in Scotland will be of great benefit," said Beatty.
Doyle said, "I'm going to act as an athlete's representative, and I hope I can really benefit and contribute to the development of sports in Scotland."
An American, a four - time Olympic champion, who won a 200 - and - 400 - foot [200 - 400 m] race in 1996 in the Atlantic, and now a sports observer for the BBC, lost the chance to walk through a transitory ischemist attack.
He wrote in Twitter, "I had an stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it would only take time to see if I could recover and how much.
Thanks to the incredible effort, I was able to recover completely, and I have learned to walk again and to do dynamic exercises today!
Thank you for your words of support!"
Women's milk-smoker advertisements compared with cows - Internet user opinions split
The producer of milk-smokers met with a mixed reaction of Internet users to advertising in which young mothers are compared to active cows.
To mark the release of a product called "the world's first silent natural milker", the technology company of Elvie's consumer products released an ad in the style of a humorous music video to demonstrate the freedom that a new vacuum cleaner provides to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a blue cornet filled with the words, "Yes, I'm eating myself, but I don't have the tail" and "If you see it yourself, it's not the poison, it's my breast."
And then the chorus sings, "Smooth, smooch to feed the kids, smooch, smooch, smooch so milk doesn't waste."
However, the advertising role, published on Facebook’s page, led to a noisy online discussion.
The video has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the Internet user reaction has proved to be inconclusive. Many people have noted that the advertising has underestimated the "horrible organization" of dairy production in industry.
"It's not very wise to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to milk, but their children are being taken to them for a few days after birth," said one of the users.
Elvie can easily be hidden in the food bottle (Elvie/Mother)
There's another comment: "It's understood that it's traumatic for both mother and child.
But why don't you put them on the milk-sucking commercials for women who need to feed their babies?"
Someone else said, "This advertisement is very far from reality."
Other users took a stand for the advertising role. One of the women turned out to be very fun.
"I think it's a great idea.
I would definitely have bought that thing if I were still feeding my breast.
When I was sucking milk, I really felt like a cow.
The advertisement was a bit crazy, but I didn’t look for the hidden content.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
And there's another comment: "A regular advertisement, oriented to the mammals that suck the milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This advertisement is not aimed at highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women show the milk-smokers hidden in their bottles.
The concept of advertising is based on information that many women who use similar products feel like cows.
But the Elvie sucker works absolutely quietly, has no wires or tubes, and is easily hidden in the bisthalter for food. This allows women to move freely, keep children and even go out the street.
Anna Balarin, partner and executive creative director of the advertising agency Mother, commented on the situation: "The Elvie confectioner is so revolutionary that he demanded a bright and provocative presentation.
Having spent a lot of time with women who suck milk and real cows, we wanted to pay attention to the characteristics of breast-feeding, in an exciting and interesting way by demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that a new blower will bring.
The Elvie blower is not the first time in the headlines.
Within the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared at the showroom with this product when she showed the clothes from the Martti Jacobovski model.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to the tent town on the technical border
The number of detainees has increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because strict rhetoric and politics on the part of the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children in nursing homes.
Traditionally, in most cases, the caretakers have made their own statements without documents, and now they are afraid to put their own chances of staying in the country by offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to give fingerprints and that these data would be transferred to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Bureau, testified before the Congress that the Bureau's staff arrested dozens of people who applied for care for minors without escort.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Approximately 80% of people who are caregivers or members of their households are in the country illegally -- many of them -- foreigners who have committed crimes.
That's why we continue to persecute these people," said Mr. Albens.
According to the workers of the shelter, to discuss matters of children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require some of the children to appear before the court within a month of detention, not 60 days later, as was the case.
Many of them will be able to use videoconferencing and not come to court personally to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who do not have the right to receive asylum will be deported quickly.
According to employees, shelter and official data from responsible officials over the past few months, the longer the children are kept in custody, the more likely they will be to feel anxious or depressed, which may cause the alarm of violence or the attempts to escape.
Drivers claim that these problems are reinforced in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor children’s psychological status.
They added that by moving the children to the tent town and not giving enough time to prepare themselves emotionally or to make friends, we risk strengthening the trauma that many of them have already experienced.
Syria ordered the U.S., France, and Turkey to expel the army immediately.
Also, speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mual has urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been in war for eight years.
Moala, who also works as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were staying on the Syrian land illegally under the rule of combating terrorism, so "their attitude would be appropriate."
"They must go immediately and not set conditions," he said to the assembly.
Mualam insisted that "war on terrorism has actually ended" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has placed approximately 2,000 military personnel in Syria, mainly teaching and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who speak against President Bashar al-Assad.
In a war - torn country, France sent more than 1,000 soldiers.
With regard to refugees, Mualem made sure that the country had the right conditions for their return, and he also accused "some Western countries" of "promoting unwarranted fears", which do not force refugees to return.
"We have called on international co-operatives and humanitarian organizations to encourage people to return," he said.
"We're watching an effort to politicalize the humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to rebuild the country until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war has been reached.
UN diplomats report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone around Idlib, the last major rebel fleet, has created an opportunity for further political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented the massive rise in Syrian forces supported by Russia in the province where three million people live.
However, Mulam stressed that the agreement had "clear terms", and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including the Al-Qaeda-related fighters of the An-Nur Front, who would "be destroyed."
UN Commissioner Staffan de Mistura is looking forward to calling for the first meeting of a new committee to be composed of government and opposition representatives to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and to create conditions for elections.
Mualam laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that his work should be limited to the "review of the articles of the actual constitution", and warned against interference.
Why the Trumpet Will Be Redesigned
According to this logic, the Trump can be redesigned in 2020 if, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, it does not constitute a full-fledged mandate after scandal and impication.
No doubt it would be "the most dramatic completion of the presidency all the time"!
At the moment, viewers do not give a sign of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in the premium have doubled (up to 1.05 million) on the CNN channel and actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on the MSNBC channel.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the prime, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC cable channel was at the top of the 3.5 million viewers in the evening when the main news is being discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people, because it's beyond our understanding," said Neil Ber, the leading drama producer "Last Candidate" on the ABC channel of the state secretary who becomes president after the destructive attack on Capitol.
Nell Sköll, an experienced writer-thumourist and author of the book "Just the funny moments: as well as a few hard truths about how to get into Hollywood men's club," suggests another theory.
She recalled a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The leader told her that she would vote for the Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he's making me laugh," he said.
Chaos is thinking.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, Washington's stories are capable of identifying the future of Row's case against Wade, the possibility of bringing together immigrant families and the state of the world's economy.
Dishonesty is a pleasure that only the most privileged viewers can enjoy.
And yet you can't say that you're just trying to stay informed by citizens when you watch a group of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodworth's "well-known" source for his book Strah, the mansion of Paul Manafort from the skin of the Strauss for $15,000 ('wear for the Voids'), as it was written in The Washington Post) and the shocking results of Mr. Tramp's anatomy, published by Storm Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be a former.
"The reality of the show is partly related to the fact that you are getting something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the Star Loombard TV program, about the rotations in the actor's warehouse and the daily routines of the tramp show.
If you allow yourself to miss a single episode, you can rest hopelessly.
When this week I was able to meet Mr. Fles in his house on the northern coast of the island of Cauai, there was a warm sunny weather (27 degrees Celsius), but he was at home looking at MSNBC and writing CNN.
He could not get rid of the TV — not when Brett Cavano was put before the Senate's Legal Committee, but the future of the Supreme Court hung on his head.
"I remember how we created all those crazy shows of our time, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fles told me.
"I took it as a joke, but it looks like they were right."

External impact of costs in the most difficult intermediate elections at Congress
It's no wonder that the 17th county of Pennsylvania is targeted at additional cash flows, because two actual congressmen are looking for one chair through the polling districts.
In the fight for this primitive Pittsburgh area, whose borders have recently been changed, democracy enters, a member of the Chamber of Representatives Connor Lemb, who won a victory in another district in the additional elections last spring.
Lemb opposes another actual congressman, the Republican of Kitt Rothfs, who now represents the 12th county of Pennsylvania, whose borders are largely linked to the new 17th.
The maps were recast after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January approved the decision that the old boundaries of the areas were designated for the benefit of the Republican against the Constitution.
The pre-elections in the new 17th district provoked fierce opposition between the financial divisions of the main parties, the U.S. Democratic Party Committee of Congress Elections (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
Lemba's name became very famous in Pennsylvania after winning a minimum victory in the 18th district during an additional election at Congress in March, which was used by the general public.
President Donald Trump won a 20-point victory in this district.
Political experts gave little advantage to the Democrats.
In the United States, El Salvador's punishment for China's support was considered, but it was reconsidered.
The diplomats recalled Washington’s weak opposition to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, who had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela.
Officials of the State Department decided to dismiss US diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama through "the recent decision on non-recognition of Taiwan," said the secretary of the Department of Health, Geser Noiert, at the beginning of this month.
But sanctions were only against El Salvador, who received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, particularly in the field of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The fines offered to reduce the financial assistance and the target visa restrictions would be painful for this country in Central America with its high level of unemployment and murder.
As a result of the internal councils of the North American and Central American states, the conference was held at a high level, dedicated to security and economic prosperity, and a similar development took place last year, and it was assessed as a step forward in efforts to prevent the flow of migrants in the United States.
But by mid-September, the high-ranking officials of the administration realized that they wanted the conference to take place. In fact, the question of sanctions against El Salvador was stopped.
According to diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pens is now planning to attend a conference scheduled for mid-October, indicating that the administration considers that this move is very important.
The three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, for there was no new harsh news or punishment from Washington.
Mr. Bolton’s representative in the White House refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions that had been reported by three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, on terms of anonymity.
The information they received was confirmed by a foreign analyst, close to the administration, who also spoke under the terms of anonymity.
Learn History
The following dissatisfaction may be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller on possible interference with justice on the part of Trump, the weight of proof of why we can now find public information.
As it is reported, in his investigation, Muller is checking the possible link between the Trump campaign and the attack on our Russia-side voting system.
If the influence of the Congress goes into other hands, the Trump will have to report to the congressionals, as well as to the electorate and finally to the peers.
In this case, there's a lot of "if anything," and I don't want to say that the fall of the Trump is inevitable, just like his colleague in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that determines the duration of the fight.
In 1938 the German officials were ready to set up a coup against Hitler if only the West began to oppose him and to support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We had failed and lost the chance to avoid bloodshed.
The wave of history is defined by such fragile moments, and the immeasurable movement of democracy is accelerated or slowed down.
The Americans are now waiting for a few of these breakthroughs.
What will we do if Trump is fired by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person on whose behalf Mr. Muller's part?
Rosenstein came into the hall as soon as this paper reported that he offered to secretly record talks with the president and to share his thoughts on the issue of the failure of Trump's position.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times inaccurate.
"How do we react if the investigation against Brett Cavano, who has recently begun the FBI, proves to be inadequately careful or honest, or if Kawano's candidacy in the Supreme Court is confirmed, despite convincing allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And, first of all, are we going to vote in the middle of the year for those members of the Congress who will be able to bring about the responsibility of Trump?
If we fail these tests, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I don't think we're going to do it because of the lesson I took in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported in Osvenci, the same Nazi regime that once occupied my post office.
She survived, immigrated to America, and for 60 years she sent me to light Saturday candles on a table with a satchel.
Having such a legacy, can I not look to the future with optimism?"

Gram Dorrans from Rangers with optimism awaits meetings with the Vienna Rapid.
The Rangers FC accepts Rapids on Thursday. After an impressive nobody in Spain in the game with "Villareal" at the beginning of this month's victory over Austrians, the Scottish club will have a good chance to get out of the G League of Europe.
Because of the trauma of the knee, semi-defender Gram Dorrans was able to play for his team for the first time in the season only in the game with "Villareal", which ended with the account 2:2. However, he believes that the FC "Randers" can use this result as a trampline to achieve greater.
"It was a good result for us because "Villareal" is a strong team," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went out to play with hope to get a point and got one point.
At the end of the match, we might be able to move forward, but no one at all is likely to be considered fair.
In the first time, the opponent was better, but after the break, we corrected the situation for our benefit.
There will be another major resistance in Europe on Thursday.
I hope we can get three eyes, but it's not going to be easy. Our future rivals have shown a good result in their last game, but we can count on the support of the inflamers, and I'm sure we can give a fight and get a positive result.
Last year, of course, it was difficult, starting with my trauma and ending the changes in the club itself, but now the situation has been normalized.
We've got a great mood, and all the boys are happy.
I hope we can move on, leave behind the past season and achieve success."
Women lose sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the interviewers had a clear idea of how they wanted to organize care for themselves, few people talked about it with members of their family.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationalwide survey said that they talked to their husband or wife about the value of long - term care.
Only 10% of the respondents talked to the children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't rush into talking about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Society for Life Insurance.
Here's what we need to start with.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: your family can't provide you with the care you need if you don't tell your parents your wishes in the past.
Consult your consultant and your family to determine where and how to get care, because this choice can be an important factor in determining the value.
Include a financial adviser: He may advise you on how to cover your expenses.
The source of long-term care funding includes a traditional insurance policy, a hybrid policy for life-saving insurance or a self-assurance on your own cost (on the condition that you have money).
Prepare legal documents carefully: This will enable you to avoid legal loopholes in the long run.
Prepare your representative’s confidence that he will monitor your medical care and monitor your wishes if you are unable to do so personally.
In addition, we recommend that we develop trust in money.
Choose a trusted person who will make a financial decision for you and pay your bills if you are unable to do so.
Do not forget about minor details. Imagine that one of your elderly parents is in need of immediate medical attention, so he is taken to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such information to be ready.
"It's not just about money, it's important who's a doctor," Martin says,
which medicines can be taken and
Who's watching the dog.
Prepare a plan like this."
In Ilfrakum, a man shot several times from a pneumatic gun
The man fired several times from the pneumatic gun when he returned home from the party.
A 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracumi, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
The officers described the shooting that took place at 02:30 in Britain's summer time as "accident."
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His wounds are not a threat to life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, reports government officials, but the number of victims may increase.
As a result of the exit of the liaison system, officials dealing with humanitarian aid are unable to obtain any information from Dongal's regency, a region north of Pala, which is located closer to the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude.
After the natural disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Pala.
Let us discuss a few basic facts about the location of the island of Sulavesi in the city of Palu and the regency of Dongal.
Pala, the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 according to the 2017 data.
When a tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency extending more than 300 km (180 km) along the shoreline on the northwestern coast of the island of Sulavesi.
According to the 2017 census, about 299,200 people live in the administrative region of the lower province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic sectors of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel’s products are also important in the province, but mainly concentrated in Morovala, on the opposite coast of Sulaves.
According to the Indonesian agency for the mitigation of the effects of natural disasters over the past 100 years, the tsunamis have been hit several times by Pala and Dongal.
In 1938, the tsunamis in Dongal killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, the tsunami also covered the western part of Dongal, and nine men died.
Indonesia is located in a seismic active Pacific fire ring and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
The following are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceg, located in the north of Sumatra, caused the tsunamis that struck 14 countries, resulting in the deaths of 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in the province of Aceg.
2005: At the end of March, a series of powerful earthquakes broke out on the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake of 6.8 - inch - south of Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island, caused tsunamis that hit the southern coast, resulting in the deaths of some 700 people.
2009: Near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra, an earthquake of 7.6 points has been recorded.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The 7.5 - inch - high earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawa, located near Sumatra, and caused tsunamis to rise to 10 meters, resulting in the destruction of tens of forces and the deaths of about 300 people.
2016: The weak earthquake was regented in the province of Acheg, causing the destruction and panic associated with the fact that people had not yet forgotten the devastating earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time there were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed under the breakup of buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the tourist island Lombok in Indonesia, resulting in more than 500 deaths, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed countless homes, and thousands of tourists could not immediately leave the island.
The eldest son of Sara Pailin was arrested for domestic violence
Three Pailin, the eldest son of former Governor Alaska, and a candidate for Vice President Sarah Pailin, were arrested for the charge of the attack.
According to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Police, 29-year-old Pailina from Vasili, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence and accused of obstructing reports of violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a known woman tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he picked up the phone.
As KTUU reports, Pailin is currently in charge of Matanuska-Sussetna's next insulator with the right to make a flag of $500.
He was put before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent", when he was asked if he would confess his guilt, reported online.
Pailina is accused of three Class A offences, which provide for a term of up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He's also accused of Class B offences, which is punishable by a day of imprisonment and a fine of $200.
For the first time against Pailin, criminal charges have been brought.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Pailin.
His mother, Sarah Pailin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is now under consideration by the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, as well as with obstructing reports of domestic violence and carrying arms in a state of alcohol abuse when this incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
In 2016, Sarah Pailin was criticised by a group of veterans for justifying her son’s cruel behavior with post - traumatic stress after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, the earthquake caused tsunamis: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
A 7.5 - inch - long earthquake called for tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Networks of connections and power supply are out of power, and the number of victims can increase in the next few days.
The earthquake was close to the center of the island of Sulavesi, located on the north-east of the capital of Jakarta, Indonesia.
The video on social media shows the moment of the crash.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach of Palo when the tsunamis broke down on the beach.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a suspect in a New York attack
In New York, federal prosecutors demand the death penalty of Saifolo Saipov, a suspect in a New York attack, resulting in the death of eight people — a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
As they say, in October 30-year-old Saipov, a driver hired at the Home Depot pickup went on a bicycle track along a road in the West Side, Lower Manghetten, and began to hit the bikers and pedestrians that hit him on the way.
In line with the report of the intention to seek the death of the state of New York in order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipos "namously" killed eight persons and "namously" caused serious bodily damage.
According to court records, each of these charges provides for the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal jury filed Saikov's charges for 22 counts, including eight charges for murder for the purpose of demanding that federal prosecutors usually file cases related to organized crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of road transport.
According to the prosecutors who described Saipov's crime as "a horrible, cruel and vicious one," this attack is the result of "reverent planning and preconceived thinking".
The victims of Saifla Habibullaevich Saipov's injuries, damage or killing, became Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lora Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferroi, Ernan Diego Mendos, and Alejandro Damian Pagnukko, as described in the report of the purpose.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time in the South of New York was a criminal case that was punished with a death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers and was finally sentenced to eternal imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty for the federal case took place in New York in 1953, the couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenbergov, were killed after being sentenced to a spin-off for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenbergs were killed at the electric table.
According to Saipov’s court records, Uzbek’s native mother did not show a guilty conscience within the next days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the result that he was not sorry for what he had done.
According to Saipov’s indictment, he was inspired by the authority for the video IDI, which he was viewing on his phone.
The police report that he also asked to hang the IDIL flag in his hospital room.
He did not blame himself for the 22 - point charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed" with such a decision by the prosecutor's office.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty rather than a confession of guilt and a sentence of eternal imprisonment without the possibility of release will only strengthen the psychological trauma of all the victims," Patton said.
Saipov’s defence party also earlier asked the prosecutors not to demand a death penalty.
Member of Parliament of the Conservative Party believes that NAYJELA FARADJA must be appointed responsible for negotiations on Brexit
Today, during a protest campaign at the Conservative Party, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the national army."
The former leader of the UK Independence Party stated that politicians should "see pressure on themselves" Eurosceptics, since one of the MPs in the Parliament of Teresa May proposed their candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party Peter Bowe said on the march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be gone" if Mr. Faraj was Secretary Brexit.
Attention to the problems that May encountered, trying to reconcile its deep-seated lines, has further led to the fact that MPs from the Conservative Party, who are protesting, joined a special protest action in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is trying to put into practice the compromise Chequers plan, despite attacks on Brexit's supporters, those against the exit, and the EU.
The allies insist that it will not allow an attempt to deal with Brussels, despite a negative reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and Laborists to choose between what it proposes, and what it says.
At the Leave Means Leave meeting in Seoul, Mr. Bowe said he wanted to "response the Chequers."
He invited Mr. Faraday to leave the shadows and assume responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had answered for it, we would have gone out," he said.
Parliament MP Wellingboro added, "I'm going to support Brexit, but we have to turn down the Chequers."
Addressing the EU, he said: "We fought in world wars, not to be subordinated.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bown rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, the public opinion changed: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and do not want to go out, absolutely does not fit in."
A member of the Conservative Party and Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to the reporters, "I'm just saying, "Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not popular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists, who actually walk in the streets and fight for the voters' voices.
Please reject the Chequers and start listening."
In response to Teresa May, she added, "Ministers keep their position when they make promises."
Mr. Faraj said politicians should "see pressure on themselves" if they were to refuse the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us, people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them it won't come out of their hands."
In a message to the full enthusiasm of the crowd, he added, "I want our political elite, who is planning to betray Brexit, to feel pressure on himself.
We are mobilizing the national army of this country, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and we will never be calm until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the opponents of the march passed by Birmingham, and then they held a two - hour meeting in the city center.
Several activists fanned the "Conservatories against Brexit" banners after the group was launched.
The Laborist Lord Adonis laughed at the conservatives because they had security problems after opening the conference because of their party program.
"These people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a complete farce.
There's nothing good in Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning to "seriously think" about running for the president's office.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said after the election in November, she "is seriously thinking about going to the president's office."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday during the general meetings in Western Massachusetts, a representative of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts told of his future.
Warren, who often criticises President Donald Trump, battles in November for a second term against a member of the Republican Party of Jeff Dilla, who was the leader of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is viewed as the main candidate that can fight Trump in 2020.
On Saturday, her 36th election meeting took place in the form of general congregations since Trump entered the post.
The participant asked her if she was planning to take part in the presidential election.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and set up a government, and for that to happen, there must be a woman."
They arrested a suspect in the murder of the firearms of the LSU Tigers basketball player, Sims.
The Baton-Ruz police, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that the suspect was arrested on Friday in the murder of the LSU Tigers basketballist Wade Sims.
The Baton-Russia Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dieton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. in the East.
On Friday, they published a video of the shooting asking to help identify the person on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot at the campus of the University of Southern on Friday morning.
"Vade Sims got a fire wound in his head and died as a result," said reporters 247sports chief of the Murphy J. Paul police on Saturday.
Wade joined his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of a survey, Simpson was found to be at the scene of the crime, armed with him, and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody in the East Baton County Police Department.
Sims, who was 6 feet tall and 6 inches tall and who went to the junior league, grew up in Baton-Russ, played 32 games with 10 stars in the past season and played on average 17.4 minutes in the field, picked 5.6 points and 2.9 points.
Gran-Fri Russia: Lewis Hemilton cut off the world champion's retreat after the team decided to give him victory over Sebastian Fettel.
Since Walter Botts left behind Lewis Gemilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes’s command decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Botts had a good start on the pole and almost walked around Hemilton, who was trying to keep his position on the first two turns and gave Fettel the chance to attack his companion on the team.
Fettel went to the pit stop first and left Gemilton on the track in the tail of the race, which had to be decided.
The pilot of the Mercedes team went another round and went out behind Fettel, but Gemilton went out in the leadership after a certain wheel-to-wheel maneuver, resulting in the driver Ferrari reluctantly left the internal space because of the risk that would hold him back, after the double maneuver led him to proceed on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the rear row of the network and remained in the seventh place until the end of the first round.
Later, he led most of the race because he did not change the tires so that he could quickly come to the finish and contain Kim Rykkonen from fourth place.
In summary, he stopped at the pit stop at the 44th wheel, but couldn't increase the speed of the last eight, because of why Rickkonen planted the fourth place.
"It's a difficult day, because Walter was teaching full at all the exits and showing the glory when he gave me the chance to go.
The team did an exceptional job to take the first and second places," Hemilton said.
The language of the body was not impressed
At a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Finnstein for his firm position that she had not declared the contents of a letter from Christine Blaise Ford, who charges a candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kawano with sexual violence.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not address directly the testimony given by Ford before the Senate's Legal Committee, but instead expressed his opinion on the events in the Senate, which, he said, demonstrated human "fear, abhorrence and falsehood".
"The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful things that's happening in the Senate in the last few days, is anger, you see the evil people who show pride, hatred and lies," he said.
"You look at the publications and the information published, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Finnstein, did you report the information?
Remember her answer... have you announced the contents of the documents?
Oh, no.
I didn't announce it."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't," he added, copying the behavior of the senator.
In July, Finnstein came up with a detailed statement of the charges brought against the Kawano ford, and in early September, his content was announced, but Finnstein denied that the information was in his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusation, I didn't disclose the information received from her," says The Hill to the Finnstein Committee.
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I didn't break my promises."
However, her rejection seemed to be displeasing to the president, who commented on the Saturday meeting: "I'll tell you, the language of her body has not impressed you at all.
Maybe she didn't do it, but I didn't see anyone holding worse."
Continuing to protect the candidate to the Supreme Court, whose three women were accused of sexual violence, the president admitted that the Democrats were using charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to restore power in any necessary way.
You see pride, bitterness, they're all the same, they're the ones to blame, they're the ones to go through to get power and control," the Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
Elite League: "Dandy Schar" – "Belfast Giants", 5:3
The player "Jeants" Patrick Duyer threw two sharks in a match against "Dandy."
"Dandy Schart" was rehabilitated for a five-year-old defeat in an elite league by Belfast Giants, winning a match-response on Saturday at 5:3.
The "Jeants" were given an early advantage in two sharks due to Patrick Duyer's and Francis Bowley's evictions.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney compared the bill in the home match, and then Duyer re-entered the Giants.
The player "Dandy" François Bushar compared the bill, and the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory.
This is the third in the season of the elite league defeat of Adam Kiff, who won a volleyball victory over Dandi at 2:1 a.m. Friday night in Belfast.
It's the fourth team meeting in the season, and three previous teams won the "Jeants" team.
The first brother-in-law, Douayer, was shot at the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFall's transfer, and four minutes later, Boville, who received the brother-in-law from David Rezerford, doubled the bill.
After a tense first period in fourteen minutes (13:10) Sullivan returned the owners of the field to the game, and at sixteen minutes (15:16) Connie, receiving a cookie from Matt Markhardt, compared the bill.
Dwyer took advantage of "Jeants" before the first break, throwing his second brother at the end of the first period.
Masters of the fields were regrouped, and Bushar at twenty-eighth minute (27:37) again compared the account, throwing the ship when his command was overtaking.
Thanks to the efforts of Couni and Charles Corcoran Nielsen at the end of the second period, he took Dandi out for the first time and won his team in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the "Jeants" team, which has lost four of the last five matches, plays a front match against "Millton Kinnes."
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on the plane could escape the earthquake
The airman in Indonesia was declared a hero after he helped fly a plane with hundreds of people by the price of his own life.
Over 800 people died and many disappeared after a severe earthquake that caused tsunamis on the island of Sulavesi on Friday.
Strong underground traffic continues to hit this area, and many people have been trapped in the city of Pala.
However, unlike his colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the dyspepsia tower, which was heavily disbanded, at the airport of Mutier SIS Al-Jufre in Pal.
He remained in place to make sure that the 6321 Batik Air airline, which was then on the flight deck, rose safely in the air.
Then he burst out of the dyspepsia tower when he thought it would be ruined.
Then he died in the hospital.
A representative of the Indonesian air navigation service provider Johannes Siruit said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian Agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikapapan in Kalimantan, which is to be delivered to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We're very sorry to hear about it," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the number of victims can reach thousands, as the agency, with the mitigation of the effects of natural disasters, claims that access to the cities of Dongal, Sigi and Bhutan is limited.
"The number of victims can increase, as many bodies are still under break, and many of them cannot be reached," said Soutopo Purvo Nugroho, a representative of the agency.
The height of the six - foot - high [6 m] earthquake devastated the city of Pala, where the mass burials will take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger planes provide assistance and food.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute a quick help brings the body.
Clean water is not enough.
The mini-markets are stolen all over the place."
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Helfand, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is hurrying to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know that they will be there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joco Ovido, came to Pala on Sunday and asked the country's military personnel, "I ask you all to work day and night to do all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia suffered earthquakes on the island of Lombok, resulting in the deaths of over 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: As stated in Air Niguini, after the plane crashed into the lagoon, one man disappeared unconsciously.
The airline that took the trip to the Pacific Coast in Micronesia now claims that one person has disappeared without a conscience, although it was reported that all 47 passengers and crew were successfully evacuated from a ton aircraft.
Air Niguini stated that one passenger could not be found in the state on Saturday.
The airline reports that its representatives try to find a man and cooperate with local authorities, hospitals, and the following authorities.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed when it tried to land at Chuk Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men were taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the disaster and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
In the airline and the U.S. V.S. stated that the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the air traffic jam.
Some witnesses believe the plane has crossed the flight deck.
American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane flew very low on the ground.
"It's very good," said Janes.
Janes explained that he and others managed to get to the crash exits on a ton of water.
He told us that the stewards panicked and shouted and that he had a slight head injury.
In the U.S.A., mariners working close to the modernization of the story also assisted in rescue operations by transporting people to the shore by means of an inhaled boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to Aviation Safety Network data in the last two decades, 111 people have died in a plane crash related to the PNG aircraft, but Air Niguini does not appear on this list.
The analyst restored the chronology of the night the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the accused party violated the case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Roulette witnessed as an expert in the field of operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to replay the movement of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim of Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Roulette, reported The Clarion Ledger, reported that he had received location data from a number of mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night when she died that she objected to his previous claim.
When the data showed that his cell phone was next to Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the last.
On Saturday, Sanford gave a witness and claimed that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth, when he said he was in the Sanford pickup that night, Sanford said he was "false because my pickup was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had said that he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Phone records indicated that they only knew each other for weeks.
Roulette told us that shortly after the death of Chambers Tellis, he published text messages, phone calls, and contact information from Chambers.
"He stared her from his life," said Gail.
The defense should set out its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: what is a conscious hip-hop?
Three hip-hop executives want to challenge the negative view of the genre, filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed Group in Bristol claims that hip-hop has changed its nature – has gone away with political ideas and struggles to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the sources and make a conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently witnessed the restoration of this direction in the United Kingdom by such groups as Akala and Lowkey.
Another blacksmith?
In New York, she called a couple for release after receiving a "racist" message.
In New York, she filed a call for a couple for a discriminatory release after receiving the wrong message from her mother with a complaint that she was "one more dark."
The marriage denies that they are racist, comparing calls to "request."
Lucy Plasco-Flacksman, a mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that the new bride, Giselle Morris, who came to her first working day in 2016, was a blacksmith.
"We'll have one dark," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flackman to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending him to her husband, however, she sent him to her mother - in - law twice.
As New York Post reports, when she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flackman felt "uneasy" and released Ms. Morris, who said that their previous African-American bride was wrong to do her job and that she was expecting a Filipino bride instead.
Ms. Morris paid for one day's work, and then they went home to Uber.
Now, Morris gives a couple to the court, hoping to get compensation for the payroll that she would receive in six months of living in a marriage where she was first hired, even without a contract, and she had to pay $350 a day.
"I want to show them what they don't have to do," she said on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the accusation that they were racist, the couple stated that the release of Morris was a wise decision, for they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after being offended.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco, her husband, Post.
"But would you leave your children with the man who was rude, even if it wasn't intentional?
Your baby?
That's right."
Comparing the call with the "request," Plasco said his wife had only born a child two months ago and "not yet revealed."
"Would you blame someone after that?
It's a bad thing," said the investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned this couple in social networks, criticizing their behavior and logic.
As noted in the new letter, the publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not understand the idea of a bear who could speak
Bonda Karen Yankel's daughter, who was born almost immediately after the book agreed to print, said about the letter, "It's hard to put herself in the place of the one who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It's funny now, because we know of the huge success that's been achieved in the story of Padington."
Speaking of her father, who worked as a BBC operator, before a little toy bear inspired him to write a child's book, optimizing what his work was being done, she shared how at the 60th anniversary of the book's release she felt "happy and sad," because her father died a year ago.
With regard to Padington, which she describes as "very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
"He was pretty modest and didn't like to boast," she said.
"But Padington was as real to him as his own child! For when the children reach something, we are proud of them, even though it is not theirs, not our victory.
I think he was looking at the success of Padington just like that.
Although Padington was the creation of his imagination, he always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After her daughter was landed, she was transferred to a hospital called Louis Pastera in Nice, where doctors were unsuccessful in trying to save her life.
"Nad called regularly, said it was really bad that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Eden-Laperuz.
"And then Nad called me and said she'd die in the next two minutes and I should say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Dash, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The doctors who gave her to keep her heart beating gradually stopped acting and left the body.
She died for a while before everything was turned off.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing what was going on at that time.
I couldn't sue, yell or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really should've held my hand."
Finally, Mrs. Eden-Laperuz, who was burning through the loss of her daughter, sat on the plane with other passengers, not paying attention to the severe trials she had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
"I dropped my head and couldn't hold my tears.
It was hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to feel deep compassion for Nada.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who have suffered grief leave their letters to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from putting their hands on themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys leave a note on the Wall Street Bridge with phone numbers that people can turn to for support and messages that they would like to receive.
Miss Davis Tyler’s son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he put his hands on himself.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same as I do every day," she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lidney, told me that her son was a promising chef with a beautiful smile.
"Everyone knew him for a smile.
They always said that this smile made any room brighter."
But he quit his job before he died because he was "like in the dark."
In 2014, a brother named Tyler, then 11, found his brother’s body after he laid his hands on it.
Miss Davis says, "I'm always afraid that this will have consequences."
Miss Davis created the letters, "that people might know there are those they can talk to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't shut up, you need to talk."
Miss Hamfres, who has been friends with Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, who lived with him for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
"He didn't say that he felt depressed, that he had depression or something," she said.
"In a few days before Christmas, we noticed that he changed."
And on the day of Christmas, he finally forgot the spirit, and when the children opened their gifts, he did not look into their eyes, either."
She told them that his death had become a huge trauma to them, but they had to survive it: "This has caused a devastating
It's for the family.
But we must continue to live and fight."

The future of Brett Cavano depends on the hair: the FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if we could get what we asked -- limited in time and nature of investigation -- we might have reached a certain agreement," said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would "resolve" in the face of the unprecedented loss of the loyalty of the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Kawano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their unrest is related to time.
Intermediate elections will take place in five weeks, November 6th, and if the Republicans are expected to face problems, it will seriously complicate their efforts to bring their own people to the Supreme Court of the country.
George V. Bush phoned senators asking to support Mr. Kawano, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush's administration and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now sitting, a vote will take place.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kawano can have at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice-President Mike Penz to solve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy as the Supreme Court judge.
During the reign of Kima, the number of North Korean survivors has been cut short.
After Kim Chen In came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees had dropped to South Korea, the South Korean legislator said.
Pac Pion Seug, referring to the United Republic of South Korea Ministry, stated that last year the number of survivors was 1127 compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Pack said that the key factors were to strengthen border control between North Korea and China, as well as that illegal smugglers now demand more money.
In Phenyan, public comments were held.
The vast majority of North Korean passersby finally offer South Korea citizenship.
In Seoul, it was reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border after the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views migrants as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still formally at war, has improved markedly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of two countries met in Pyrenees and discussed the issues of denuclearization that had been discussed.
This happened after the June U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Chen In in Singapore, where they generally agreed to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister Yoon-Ho accused the United States of not making progress ever since.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no speech of unilateral disarmament," Ri Jon-Ho said in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavano "a hysterical" and says he's not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the position of the Supreme Court Judge Brett Cavano "historic" and stated that he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed his thoughts on a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I've always thought that if a woman ever acted like this, she would be called "historic," "Pelosy commented on her reaction to the testimony of Kawano before the Senate's Legal Committee on Thursday.
The Kawano emotionally denied charges of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kawano was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and coughing, discussing his family and his school years.
He also openly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling charges against him "absolute and coordinated destruction of the reputation", organized by the Liberals, who were outraged by what Hillary Clinton had lost in the 2016 presidential election.
According to Pelosi, the testimony of Cavano proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his prejudice toward the Democrats.
"I think that with these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and the Democrats, he will take his own candidacy," she said.
Palosi was upset when she was asked if she would try to declare the Kavano empire, if his wine was confirmed, and whether they would get the democracies in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say so: if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he doesn't only deserve to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," said Pelosi.
Kawano is currently serving as a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the province of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democracy, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Cavano against the law "On Available Medical Services" or the case "Rou v. Wade" because he was considered a conservative judge.
At his hearings on the question of the approval of the Kawano position, the party asked whether he would cancel some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"Now is not the time when the judge becomes a hysterical, prejudiced person and we'll say how wonderful it is," said Pelosi.
Women must possess this weapon.
These were just words that contained months and years of anger, and she could not express them without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," she told me 45 years later, Miss Stan.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on, "A woman who worked for the executive director and helped me a lot, said that she also cried when she was angry, but she had her own methodology, and when she was angry and started crying, she said to the interviewer, "You can think I'm sorry and that's why I'm crying.
And I'm evil."
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was amazing."
The tears are considered acceptable to anger partly because they are perceived differently.
One of my most vivid memories of my first work at the office, where most men worked, was the situation when I once cried out of unexplained anger, and the older woman, the unfriendly manager I was always a bit afraid of, grabbed me for a coma and pulled me to the front cell.
"Never let them see how you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be glad they got to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from the Colorado Democrats, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was engaged on a non-marriage ship called Monkey Business, after he left the race, Miss Shreder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason she could not fight for the president's office.
"It was not a very thoughtful decision," she said with a smile 30 years later.
"There have already been seven other candidates in the race, and another candidate is the last one they needed."
Someone called the situation "Biloshika and Seven Dwarves".
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she stayed in the congregation, so she made a promise that she would not participate in the race unless she paid $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not harm men for $1,000, gave her just $250.
"They think they'll give me a discount?" she was surprised.
When she gave a speech and announced that she would not be conducting an official campaign, she was touched by the emotions of the people who supported her, the disappointment of the system that made the collection very difficult and forced her not to look at voters as well as members of the House of Deputies and the anger of sexism, and she was ready to cry.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," says Ms. Shredder.
You'd think Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking about what they would write on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
How a trade war between the United States and China can bring blessings to Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in a trade war between the United States and China were desperate, and although far away from its completion, the long - term gap between countries can benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the first warning shots early this year by taxing the basic Chinese export goods, such as solar batteries, steel, and aluminum.
This week’s biggest increase was due to new tariffs for goods worth $200 billion (150 billion), which actually accounts for half of all goods coming from the United States to China.
Beijing paid the same coin every time, and recently charged a dollar from five to ten percent on American goods for 60 billion dollars.
China has committed itself to using similar US measures, and the second largest economy in the world will hardly be able to keep this promise as soon as possible.
To force Washington to resign means to accept the demands, but for President Si Xinpina, the public worship of the United States is too shameful.
However, according to experts, if Beijing is properly used, the pressure in the US trade war can bring China a long-term advantage by reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"A quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a severe economic downturn in any of the countries, and this is actually a greater threat than observers once acknowledged," said analyst Abigail Grace, who deals with issues related to Asia at the Center for New American Security Analytical Center.
Foreign Minister said Syria is "ready" to return refugees
In Syria, they claim to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and are called upon to help rebuild a country that has been devastated by war for over seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mual stated that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today's real situation has become more stable and safer because of the progress achieved in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore damaged areas so that people can return to normal life.
Now all conditions have been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they had to leave because of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and limited their means of livelihood.
According to the United Nations, over 5.5 million Syrians fled the country from the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian government would be pleased to accept assistance in restoring the war-damaged country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that support the siege.
Europe Strengthens the Battle of Rider in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 when it beat the U.S. team with a score of 16.5:10.5 on Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated in Europe for the sixth time and has not won the Cup Rider tournament since 1993.
Europe returned to its crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s command took 14.5 points that they needed to win over the United States.
The American Phil Michelson star, who tried most of the tournament, had his first long shot at the 16th Lotus of Par-3 in the water and took Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever went through the 5-0-0 from the beginning of a tournament in modern format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit suffered a defeat at 5:4 from a player with the lowest score in the European team Turbière Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who is taking the first step in the world ranking, took account of 2:1 Jan. Paulter from England, who may have taken part in the Cup Rider tournament the last time.
Spanish Serhio Garcia, the veteran of Kubka Ryder, who had already taken part in the tournament eight times, became a European who won the most of the tournaments all the time, bringing 25.5 points in his career.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't do anything today.
It was a difficult year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad, I'm so glad to return the cube.
It's the team's merit, and I'm glad I was able to help," he said, without withholding emotion, Garcia after the victory in Europe.
He's handing over to his associate, John Rem, who won the American golf legend of Tiger Woods on Sunday in a single game with a 2:1 account.
"I feel incredible pride in winning over Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, Woods lost all four winners and now has a career record on the Cube Rider 13-21-3 tournament.
Strange statistics for one of the most famous players of all time who won 14 major tournaments, only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. Assembly throughout the weekend tried to reach the ferry zone, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Fino, who showed a high - class golf course throughout the tournament.
The U.S. Captain Jim Furick said about his team after the unfortunate speech, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we dominated Europe for a short time.
We fought.
I'm taking my hat off before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the Association of Professional Players in the U.S. Golf and the Rider Tournament Committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You can't praise them.
They've lost us."
Current information about the red tide: decreased concentration in the Pinellas, Manat and Sarasota districts
The latest report by the Florida Commission on Fish and Wild Nature shows a general decline in the colouring of red microorganisms in some parts of the Tampa Bay.
According to the Florida Committee on Fish and Wild Nature, a growing flowering condition reported in certain areas of the Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collaire districts is evidenced by a decrease in concentration.
The flowering of red microorganisms extends to about 130 miles [130 km] of the shoreline from the north of Penellas to the southern districts of Lee.
The spots can be found about 10 miles from the shore of Gillsboro County, but less than last week.
The red tide was also observed in the Pasco district.
Last week, the average concentration was reported in the Pinellas district and its coastal zone, the concentration from low to high in the district of Gillsboro district, the high concentration in the district of Manat, the high concentration in the district of Sarasota and its coastal zone, the mean concentration in Charlotte County, the high concentration in the district of Lee and its coastal zone, and the low concentration in the county of Collaire.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Lee, and Collaire, there is a continuing report of respiratory exposure.
Such reports were not recorded in the northern western part of Florida last week.
