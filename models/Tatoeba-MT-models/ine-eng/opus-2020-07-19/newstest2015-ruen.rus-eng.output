FANO Russia will hold the final expert session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO Russia) together with the RAN will hold the third Expert Session "Evaluation of the effectiveness of scientific organizations".
The meeting will be final in a series of meetings held by the Agency over the year, reported in the press release of the "Lenta.Ru".
The third meeting plans to review the outcome of the Expert Session for the year and to draw up a list of indicators to assess the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
Individual participants plan to discuss the rules for the establishment of expert groups responsible for assessing the work of scientific groups and the criteria for carrying out assessments.
The third expert session will be the final event in the event of a unified approach for all three academics to assess the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded in doing so, and the final version of the regulations is in line.
As a result of the next session, we must complete the process of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the phases and timing of the evaluation," said FANO Head of Expert and Analytical Management of Russia Elena Aksenova.
Representatives of more than one hundred Russian scientific institutions will participate in the event.
As a result, the resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin on 10 a.m. to Moscow time on 16 September 2014 at: Moscow City, Solianca Street, home 14.
Scientists found a way to find family stars
Astrophysics from the University of California in Santa Cruz have studied the turbulence and its impact on chemical uniformity in constellations.
It is expected that the opening of specialists will allow the search for family members among the stars, that is, those born from one cluster.
The results of their studies were published in the journal Nature and can be briefed on the University website.
The result of the same chemical composition of nearby stars is the turbulence in the clouds of the gas preceding the formation of the stars.
Even if the birth star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition may determine the place of birth and the region of education of the naturalists.
In the past, scientists had doubts that the evolution of the star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of family members in the cluster.
The results of the modelling carried out by astrophysics show that such differences should not occur.
In their research, supercomputer specialists modeled two inter-star gas streams that formed a cloud together.
This facility has been transformed into a cluster where protostars begin to form over a few million years under its own gravity.
Scientists have added herbs to the original gas streams and have found that rapid turbulence in the cloud achieves a high degree of chemical uniformity.
According to astrophysics, their study proves that chemical-based stars can be found and that they can be identified by possible regions of education.
Police arrested 20-year-old after a high-speed motorcycle chase
The motorcycle was confiscated after traveling 125 km/h in a speed limit zone of 70 km/h and through Bushland to hide from the police in Pilbara.
The transport police patrol in Carrat tried to stop the blue motorcycle this morning, finding that its speed was 125 km/h when he left the Batgate Road service station.
The police reported that the motorcyclist had not stopped and moved on to Bergess Road and then returned to Bushland, resulting in the loss of sight by the police.
The motorcycle and the driver’s description were observed near the home of Waltcott Way in Bulgaria.
The police have accused a 20-year-old man of refusing to stop and to drive dangerously.
It must be brought before the World Court of Carrat on 23 September.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.

Lavrov: Russia will not become a "walled door" for new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not "flock the door" for new sanctions.
This is what MID Head Sergei Lavrov said today, speaking to students and teachers of IGIMO.
In view of our response to the new wave of anti-rusion sanctions, I will not even debate, fantasize, because everything has to be calculated specifically," he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners will like this time, then we will decide how to respond.
This will not be related to a knock on the door, some attempts that are easily understood, the Minister stressed.
We will, first of all, withdraw from our interests, the interests of protecting our economy, the social sphere, our citizens, our business and we will draw the partners' conclusions on their adequacy, treaty capacity and reliability.
Following the steps taken in the area of sanctions, it is very good to judge what partners are seeking - the head of the IDF continued.
If the whole voice says that "they'll also be painful to us, but we're forced to go to Russia to punish," that's probably not very appropriate."
There is no way for WTO to respond to possible new sanctions.
On the contrary, we want to make the WTO more active, including when it comes to trade disputes, said Lavrov.
We have already used this tool to overcome, as we believe, the EU's discriminatory policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia is indicted and anti-dumping measures are being applied against the RF industry.
"We are ready to implement WTO mechanisms and to resist our position on the inadmissibility of applying the third EU energy package's rules retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How to use cheese in design now?
Questionnaire Irina Okuneva answered:
Since after flowering the cheese loses its main attraction, it is willing to be made out with other artists.
It is beautifully combined with many cultures.
The cheese can and must be harvested in close proximity to plants that are decorative at other times and colourful at the same time.
Another addition to cheese is that it provides a mass of opportunities for creativity.
You can form its stem tree of different heights, improved by art, with wide ground, and even with a garden bonsai tree with a wonderfully emanated trunk.
Just choose the form that most matches the design of your current.
In the Caribbean, a resident of Leningrad is convicted of the sale of fake money
As reported in the Republic of Moldova, the man was engaged in criminal fishing in the Oloneck and the Segage region.
In addition to Kareli, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused had already succeeded in inheriting the Vologad area, where he had been sentenced to two and a half years in prison this spring.
Later, the man was brought before the Dutch District Court.
In order to complete the investigation of the crimes committed in our Republic, it was staged in Segez.
In the investigation, there was evidence of guilt on several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money by the summer of 2013.
At the end of June of the current year criminal proceedings were brought before the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the Court decided to replace the four-year term of imprisonment with a general rule.
The sentence has not entered into force legally.
Recall that last week, two other counterfeit merchants were convicted, who were paid in the Petrozawdska shops.
The citizens of Azerbaijan also arrived in Carlia from St. Petersburg.
One of them has been deprived of liberty for five years, the other for four.
Each is charged with 500 thousand rubles.
The sentence has not yet entered into force legally.
In Archangelsk, they celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first “Dervis” convoy.
The meeting, which was held in the district centre, was held on the first Arctic convoy.
Dervis provided military assistance from the United States and the United Kingdom to the USSR.
In the Archangelic meeting, the memory of the future memorial stone was held by the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the coast of Sedova in Solombal.
The event was attended by representatives of the Veteran organizations of Archangelsk, children of the Cadets class.
For the first time, we gathered twenty-three years ago when a stone was laid.
But also today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those who haven't returned to the sea," noted the chairman of the Board of Veterans of the North Sea Passage Boris Karp.
The event was followed by a city spirit orchestra, and cadets class instructors gave the veterans flowers and marched with Russian flags and the flag of Victory.
The meeting ended with a set of colours for the stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of formal boots, lead, breast and many other inventory and equipment).
In addition, there were military equipment and weapons on board: 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen Harricane killers, in a demarcated state.
In this, the convoy was made up of 16 WMF ships in the United Kingdom, two of which were aircraft.
The shipyard was not found by the opponent and was well reached at the Arhangelska destination.
Of the 848 vessels involved in vital caravan operations, 126 vehicles and about 50 military vessels were killed.

I remember a very American idea that labour rights are human rights.
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill on which trade union organizations are protected as civil law.
"Where trade unions, there and middle-class jobs," says Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat, who is co-chaired by Congress of the Progressive Group.
That is why I am proud to represent the Act on the Improvement of the Rights of Workers, together with the symbol of the movement for civil rights by John Lewis.
This innovative bill will give workers the same legal opportunities in the organization of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination, which will stop the forces of trade union opponents.
Amendment of the Labour Regulation Act to enable workers who are discriminated against in the organization of trade unions to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation for damages and fines - a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative, at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the co-authors of the bill are to remember a very American thought.
Despite the attacks of trade unions in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country, Americans once supported countries all over the world in adopting, expanding and respecting labour rights.
It was a time that millions of Americans still remember when that country at the same time protected democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organization.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas McArtur and his assistants helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military coup of Hidecka Todzy was replaced by democracy.
While fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the creation of new Japan, they have included a text that directly recognized that “the right of workers to organization, to negotiations and to collective action is guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General David Eisenhower and his assistants helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article that openly stated: “The right to form associations in order to protect and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.
Agreements which restrict or seek to undermine this right will not have legal force; measures aimed at these purposes will be recognized as unlawful.
When the former former Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was chaired by the International Commission on Human Rights, which formed the World Declaration on Human Rights, to be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the composers included the guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and enter into trade unions to protect his interests”.
The American generations have taken the basic rule that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to trade union organization - and that the trade union should participate as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and governmental institutions - should be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that workers should have the right to an organization and that their voices should be heard in a free and open society.
Like the late Martin Luther King Younger said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that trade union movement has not undermined the strength of the nation, but has increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions have created a wonderful market for industry and have raised the whole nation to an unparalleled level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history will remember them.
The story reminds us of what we should do.
The official recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination against trade union organizations - has long been a matter of age.
Kit Ellison and John Lewis are reinvigorating ideals that have historically expanded America and made democracy a reality.
The judge temporarily blocks the law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the United States, on Sunday, the federal judge temporarily blocked the introduction of Louisiana law, which his supporters say will probably close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this, which was signed to be implemented by Governor Louisiana Bobby Gindal in June and was due to enter into force on 1 September, abortion physicians would be required to have the authority to accept patients in the hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision means that doctors can continue to perform legal abortions by continuing to seek such powers.
“The complainants will be allowed to work legally while continuing to seek authority,” wrote Judge John DeGrewells in his decision.
The hearing will be held during the month on which the judge will make a more permanent decision under this law.
The defenders of the right to abortion welcomed this decision, the latest in the chain of decisions against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to get hospital powers.
“Today’s decision guarantees that the women of Louisiana will be protected from the law of torture, which seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Nortap, president and head of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who filed an application for the suspension of the law from a person of three out of five state clinics.
It was not immediately apparent whether the decision was made to doctors from two clinics who had not spoken to the complainants in the case and had also made a statement of approval.
Louisiana is one of the 11 states that have adopted such laws, and the courts have recently recognized such non-constitutional measures in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key elements of the Texas law, which would have closed most of the remaining clinics in that state, were blocked by the federal judge on Friday.
The fights for the right to abortion together with the American College of Obesaries and Gynecians and the American Medical Association say that the laws on the powers of adoption impose restrictions on doctors that are not necessary in terms of medicine.
Anti-abortionists object that such measures are aimed at the protection of women ' s health, although some have also noted their positive effect in the closure of the clinic.
Only one doctor who has abortions in Louisiana has a hospital admission authority, the Center for Reproductive Rights reported.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop the procedure, the doctor, fearing their safety, would stop the procedure, the group reported.
In criticizing this decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish abortion doctors while their statements of authority were awaiting decisions.
This will lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of product in the range of trade networks should be Russian production, according to a member of the House of Commons, Oleg Nelov, of the Russian Justice Group.
The Parliament has prepared a bill to introduce protective measures against domestic producers, writes the Newspaper.
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort to buyers.
This concerns goods that are not produced in Russia. "...> According to the rest of the product groups produced in Russia, the Riddler will have to provide at least half of his family producers," Nil told the publication.
Along with the amendments to the article "On the basis of State regulation of trade in RF", the bill provides for amendments to the Tax Code, which set a reduced rate of 10% for the implementation of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50 per cent quota in trading networks is a package of incentives for Russian producers.
A few times more domestic goods will appear in the trailers.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to the lawyer, Nalovic, a member of the independent expert centre, Sergey Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, will have a positive effect and will lead to growth.
In addition, farmers, farmers, small shops will show up.
They'll be able to sell more, which means income will grow.
They will also be entitled to dictate their conditions and prices to the riders, since they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, which will result in higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenue, create new jobs, some industries will start to expand, some faster to expand, will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food is declining several times, indeed not immediately," the expert notes.
In the past, Russian companies were often unable to access local stores because of high competition from foreign analogues.
Now, after the embargo, this nest has been released and it is possible to breathe with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that, after all the necessary agreements and sanitary checks on the Russian market, food from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will be supplied.
In other words, there has now been a moment of silence when the former players have already left, and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Almost a month later, there was a growing demand for domestic raw materials, as well as an increase in the price of ready-made products," told Aif.ru, the first Vice President of the Pan-Russian Public Organization of the Russian Financial Club, Tamar Kasianov.
Similarly, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food in each category would allow the local producers to secure the sector.
In such a case, they will compete with each other rather than with goods that are cost-effective from the subsidies of another State.
In other words, the struggle for the buyer will spread among companies working under the same laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasianova notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of fellow citizens far from all the articles.
And in this situation, trading networks will have to "draw" the proportion of Russian goods up to half the range.
In this regard, there are growing fears that unscrupulous goods will be added to the trailers.
It is possible that foreign products with broken labels will be supplied in Russian," the expert added.
The negative impact of the introduction of quotas is felt by large trading networks, especially those that are more likely to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will be affected by such an arrangement, as demand for their production will decline.
Lithuania does not rule out that the quota law on domestic goods may also affect consumers.
The case is that some products of Russian production may fall by the quality of import analogues, while stores may be able to raise prices for the second, as for the defective goods.
The idea of replacing economists in the early 2000s was again discussed in February of this year because of the constant devaluation of rubles.
In the face of difficult relations with the West, the issue of rejection of imported products is becoming even more relevant.
The Act is designed to oblige the riders when making orders to suppliers to be considered as domestic producers.
Then we will go much faster and safer on the way to import, and the production planning system for the necessary types of products will be set up in a shorter time," said MEP Oleg Nilov.
In particular, the quota mechanism will be effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example in the dairy sector, where the share of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really able to fully cover Russian stores.
In addition, strong impulses can also be obtained from meat production.
As you know, the largest percentage of imports are kept in cattle, from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% still belong to Russian production," Kasianova says.
The experts believe that the introduction of quotas for domestic products is more efficient and can accelerate the process.
However, the initiative itself would not lead to import substitution, as this would require a set of measures, as Lithuania is certain.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative may still be imported from outside the border, i.e. there will be no full import replacement, but significant steps will be taken in this direction.
In addition, there is little need for quotas to be established, and domestic production is still required to meet these quotas.
The quotas are only such and will provide such guarantees," the expert notes.
Short-term diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that egg cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of their deceased mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia face a higher risk of death than those living in cities.
Researchers analyzed maps of more than 1,100 Australian women with an egg cancer diagnosis in 2005, finding that only 35 per cent lived five years after the diagnosis.
The leading researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute of Medical Studies reported that the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than those living in regions and remote areas of the state than those living in urban areas.
NATIONAL RESEARCH: New medicines can slow the cancer of the ovaries and the cancer of the ovaries
The researchers followed a medical course for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the availability of current diseases and the socio-economic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Women older and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote areas of the state, the likelihood of death during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
While the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that the diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly in large cities," she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services in order to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of exit services that would enable professionals to treat women closer to home and support programmes for people treated far away from home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of the geographical situation, the study found that longevity among women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Coast, Elise Nev, said she had an aggressive form of egg cancer.
A new FAP will open in September in the Kužener region
The construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktabelak was launched in April of this year and was carried out on a model project.
The cost of work was over 10 million rubles.
According to the management of public communications and information, the construction of the facility was financed by means of the Republican budget in accordance with the investment programme.
The total area of the treatment and prevention facility is nearly 230 square metres.
There will be medical assistance for the inhabitants of eight human settlements: the village of Toktybelak and the village of Dementievo, Puncherumal, Tunya, Fomici, Toraybelak, Shinur and Chaškajal.
The new FAP will replace the existing FAP, which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resources and its facilities do not meet the health and hygiene requirements.
The new facility will be opened soon.
The four-month-old son killed in a state of emergency will be brought before the court
The population of Chowya is on the scale of the defendants for the murder of their own child.
Cheboksar has completed a criminal investigation into the 31-year-old population of Novoscheboksarska, accused of indiscriminate death.
The follow-up found that on 26 July this year, the accused, together with the four-month-old son, came to celebrate the birthday of his cousin in Cheboxara.
After a long time, the novelty boxer decided to stay in the guest room and put the child to sleep.
When the baby woke up and cried at night, without asking for a woman, she put him on her bed to feed her breast, but she soon fell asleep.
During sleep, a woman attacked her son and ended up drowning.
The criminal case, reports the S.U.S.U.S. Press Office on Guard, sent to the court.
Inflation came out of the vacation.
If Russians feel a sharp rise in prices
As a result of cross-border sanctions, inflation in Russia will be accelerated and will not be reflected in the government's predictions, convinced by the UTB Capital analysts.
According to experts, the delayed effects of the sanctions will lead to inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, RBK Daily writes.
According to the latest forecast, inflation will be 6.5-7.5 per cent in 2014 and 6.5 per cent in the following year and less.
However, according to the Kommersent newspaper, this week the MER should make “small but basic” adjustments in macroeconomic forecasts by 2017.
According to the publication, the Authority could reduce the 2015 inflation assessment, which would eliminate the expected increase in population income.
The forecast predicted that food sanctions of the RF would be effective by August 2015.
How could such high inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation is a shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change," Minfin said the source of the newspaper.
The economists from the HICP do not share the expectations of the Government's financial and economic bloc for inflation and forecast price increases in 2014 at 8 per cent.
The main effect of the product bans will be combined with the possible introduction of the RF tax on sales (NSPs) in 2015, convinced experts.
The inflation peak will increase by 9 per cent in February, after which annual price increases will fall, experts rely on it.
In fact, last week, Rosstat brought the first inflation results after the RF introduced "accuracy sanctions".
Aif.ru questioned the experts and identified their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of the Department of Analysis FC AForex:
Price increases have already been observed in the main segments of the product.
More than when they valued socially significant products, the Government had to launch a systematic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risks of unwarranted price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and riders are already reporting on a daily basis before the regulatory authorities so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason, initiate price increases.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the enormous flow of capital, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-segregator, internal conversion due to the foreign currency of the population, as well as the import embargo on food products from countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia.
If inflation pressure remained under control, the cost of the minimum product set-up would not increase by 12 per cent per quarter.
The ban on imports of food has led to shocks on the internal market and has led to a very logical increase in final value.
Since we are not able to fully launch the import replacement mechanism at this stage, as well as to improve the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the response sanctions continue to pose a risk of inflation growth.
If you add further fiscal reasons for lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as poor prospects for economic growth, inflation may well exceed 8 per cent by the end of this year.
Alexander Razwaev, Director of the Alpari Analysis Department
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30 per cent a month, and it was also at zero levels above the current level, another case that was then offset by rapid economic growth.
I think inflation will be 8-8.5% as a result of the year.
Platon Maguto, Managing the Fund of Maguto assets
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia as long as it is successful, but further pressure on the financial sector, in particular, can lead to some difficulties and increase inflationary expectations of the population, which are usually reflected in the purchases of cash in order to secure their savings.
It may be assumed that the Government, CB RF and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the beard, both in market and in public regulation.
But the price rises traditionally after summer's silence and perhaps this autumn will become more sensitive.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia is probably 7.5 per cent, as the RF still has financial stocks.
Gardening centres suffer from a decrease in the number of households
Such a drop, due to the exceptional reduction in the number of households under 35, may lead to the loss of tens of millions of pounds per year of the “basic age of planting”, according to the HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, people who are recording housing spend on average 55 per cent of the amount that owners of their own homes spend on gardening.
It mentions an increase in the number of people living in high-urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of afforestation in front of the home for parking and the reduction of sizes now as other factors that pose a threat to the industry, the annual sales of which is estimated to be £5 billion.
In the Greater London, where the number of households fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lowest level of expenditure on household gardens in the United Kingdom.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society reported that the rental of housing and the lack of space for now do not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief gardener in the RHS, said, "Increase plants in containers, for example, especially popular among tenants who can transport plants with themselves when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the “golden century” of differential trade in vegetable products as a result of an increase in the number of domestic farmers and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid 1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather after adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria has carried out a massive cleanup in the Land Fund
Three of the four heads of the Land Fund were replaced on Friday.
In general, three of the four heads of the Land Fund were replaced on Friday.
The official Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria reported only the removal from office of Executive Director Atanas Bekwa.
His place took Lozana Vasileva.
It turned out that two of the three Deputy Executive Directors of the Fund had been replaced on Friday night.
The released Deputy Executive Director Tatian Angelov, who had previously been responsible for the State aid and SApard's programme, reports BGNES with reference to Trud.
I did not attend the Board of Governors because we are not under the law, but I was told later that I was released.
I can't tell you why my release is not reported on the fund's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope I know more on Monday," Angelov said.
Its seat will be Ivanka Baghdadov, who has thus far been the head of Investment Credit in the Central Fund in the Landland in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.

He will be appointed Zivko Zivkov, who was the head of the Regional Directorate of the Land Fund in Veliko-Tirnovo until January 2014.
Only the Deputy Chief of the Atije Alieva-Veli Foundation has retained his post.
She is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey calls for an American diplomat to report on espionage
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey called for the country's highest-ranking American diplomat to explain the report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
The Deputy Prime Minister, Budget, reported that the US affairs officer and Turkish officials had discussed the communication on Monday.
The German journal Der Spiegel and The Intercept reported that the documents provided by former analysts of the US National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a priority object of research for American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has underestimated the importance of this message, saying that all leading countries are spying on each other.
Earlier, information was reported that the main intelligence agency in Germany had also made Ankara the object of the investigation, causing a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
Major Chinese companies united against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China's largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (sects, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete online with Alibaba.
However, to catch up with a Chinese Internet miracle that left behind even its American rivals - eBay and Amazon.com, it would not be easy.
United States of America
The companies plan to invest in a joint venture of 5 billion yuan ($814 million), 70 per cent of it will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent to each of the online companies, as reported in the Wanda Group.
The company is planned to register in Hong Kong.
The SP will combine Baidu's search services with the popular WeChat social platform (the largest network in China, with approximately 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 façade-belts, the Wanda Group manages at least 49 commercial real estate facilities across China and 40 trading centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a cinematography and the theme park in Cindao (a town in eastern China on the coast of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and bring income at $960 million.
In addition, Wanda is owned by the American film theater network AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes it the largest movie theater operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its trading centres, hotels and entertainment sites with e-commerce services, which will be developed by its newly created rival Alibaba.
According to Dun Cé, who will lead a new company, the Wanda Association will be able to increase the number of users of e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new site should become the world's largest online-to-offline platform, notes Dun Cé.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) business is to attract online buyers so that they can come into normal offline stores or buy other traditional services.
The classic example of O2O is Groupon or Vigoda.ru coupon sales services.
"O2O is the largest "pirog" in online commerce," said leader Wanda Van Zijnlin (the Bloomberg quote).
"Now there is no O2O site in China, and in this situation, there is a chance for all of us to be equal," he said.
The Chinese online market is the largest in the world, and it is estimated that McKinsey & Co. will increase more than three times by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has increased to 632 million, and Bloomberg reports official statistics: it is more of the population of any country in the world, except India.
And it is estimated that by 2015 this number could grow to 850 million.
The Union of the Richer Ones
Tencent Ma Huaten's head has been China's richest man recently, but according to the Bloomberg Agency's millionaires index, the founder of Alibaba Jack Ma has already gained $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's condition is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is attributed to his share in Alibaba.
The leader Baidu Robin Lee is now taking third place among the richest people in China, while Van Xianlin from Wanda is the fourth line of ratings.
"It is very interesting to watch this battle: three of the richest people combine their efforts to challenge even more rich," Bloomberg, Director of the Chinese Centre for Electronic Commerce Research in Hanzhou Cao Lay, said.
But he believes that the new company will hardly be able to compete with Alibaba immediately after the creation of "Rome cannot be built in one day".
The fact that Alibaba is not just a competition for not only new companies, but also for world-owned Internet Trade leaders, shows a recently published report on the financial indicators of Alibaba for the last quarter.
Alibaba often describes as something average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company has earned more than two of its American competitors together.
The net profits of Alibaba for almost twice the same sum of competitors, increased almost three times per year and amounted to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has a huge potential for money generation, in many ways thanks to its mobile applications," Bloomberg commented, an analyst from Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba prospectus on the website of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company’s services in July was 188 million, a substantial increase in March (163 million).
However, 32.8 per cent of all Alibaba transactions in the past quarter have been on mobile devices.
Alibaba has to call the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to the average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed in Bloomberg, the company could be estimated at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, the Alibaba Debate at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could already be held on 16 September.
The road-show company, which preceded this event, starts on 3 September.
Alibaba's exit to the IPO is expected to be a record in NYSE history and will allow companies to attract about $20 billion.
So far, the US stock exchange record has been owned by Visa's payment system, which has made its primary stock allocation in 2008 and has earned $17.9 billion.
At least half of the foodstuffs in the trade networks should be Russian production, according to the honourable Member.
They have developed a bill on this subject.
The amendment to article 8 of the FZ “On the basis of public regulation of trade in FPs” and the Tax Code was introduced.
The aim of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, of at least 50 per cent of domestic products in stores should be per product type.
However, the document will take into account that there are products that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and winter fruits, so that they will have a "disposal" to avoid possible discomfort to buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also amended the RF Tax Code, which sets a 10 per cent reduction rate for NDS in the implementation of all food products originating in Russia, reports the Report.
On 27 August, the lower House of Parliament introduced a draft law amending the FZ " About Different Markets " , which proposes to re-establish farm markets in Russia in which small producers will be able to implement their products.
Magalupa Police Chief Indicted for Corruption
The complainants presented evidence of the expulsion by the police and officials of the municipality of Kalvia from the office of Public Prosecutor Malorki on Friday.
The chief of police in Malawi on the resort island of Malorca was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in a scandalous centre of unscrupulous drinking of Magaluffe.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained as a result of the allegations of corruption brought against him by several businessmen with Punta Ballen, a street where most of the bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to a daily publication by Mallorca Diario, the complainants presented evidence of harassment by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia at the Office of the Prosecutor of Mallorca against Corruption on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard in connection with the charges of corruption and will be interrogated by a judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that inadequate night club owners say protectionism by the authorities is seriously affecting their business.
"The thing is no longer about making money, it's about surviving," one of the businessmen told the court.
We cannot be threatened by our sources of existence.
There's nothing to lose.
Magaluf got into the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British smoker who took 24 men to the bar at the time of the bar.
The island ' s authorities have since tried to stop the hooliganism among the Magaluph-shaling, with the minimum number of scandalous alcoholic bartenders.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the incident occurred with the coin, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the organizers of the Carnage bar were charged together for €55,000 ($73,000).
The Magaluff tourist resort, mainly popular among young British vacationers, was also the scene of numerous accidents in the state of alcohol abuse related to foolish entertainment known as "balconing" when people come from one balcony to another or from one balcony to a hotel pool.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and wind conditions affecting flights at Adelaide Airport
WESNA prepared a cold surprise in South Australia, brought rain and strong winds that affected flights to Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city by 9 nights, followed by 6.6 mm, which fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a pair of short-circuited, windy streams, including grass, which started shortly before 8 evenings and poured almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter, the early spring was released last week, the temperature fell again on Monday until a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
Qualifying conditions are expected to be one of the reasons for the delay in landing Virgin Airlines from Melbourne in Adelaide.
The plane was to land immediately after 7:30 p.m., but it fell into the zone of the wind wave -- suddenly changing speed or wind direction at a short distance -- and it was forced to rise.
Wind currents reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to climb during the second landing, and the plane finally landed at 8:40 p.m.
The delay in this trip led to the subsequent delay of several other voyages, including the Emirates from Dubai and the Qantas from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is projected in Adelaide on Tuesday with the probability of one or two streams.
The calculation of construction facilities in the RF will take place again
Price formation, construction management, as well as network connection issues, the Federal Antitrust Service is taking special control.
The FAS has established an expert council on the development of competition in the field of construction.
At its meeting, the Head of Control, Construction and Natural Resources, FAS Wadim Soloviev, said that “the calculation of construction sites today is absolutely unmet”.
The normative base makes price formation untransparent and can lead to unwarranted cost of construction, considered in the FAS.
And they suggest that the value of the construction of ownership facilities at the design stage should be determined on the basis of market prices for constructive solutions instead of today's estimated standards and unit values for technological operations.
These proposals have been put into the road map and are now under consideration in the minstrel.
"The replacement of traditional accounting documentation in the construction of constructive elements should lead to less corruption in the industry," explained RGB Wadim Soloviev.
Because the estimate now covers every ball and fork, and it is not always possible to verify everything, so sometimes in the documentation, untrustworthy construction companies can bury the entire tractor.
The FAS is in the minstrel.
"The first cost-to-construction calculations for the structural elements already exist: methods for calculating the cost of constructive solutions, estimates for these indicators are developed," said the Head of the Department of Construction and Architecture of the Ministry of the Interior of Elena Zukova.
As a pilot choice of the road construction area.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
According to RGB, the head of the construction company "Profi-Invest" Anatolio Demyanko, the estimated rules have long been obsolete, but another business mechanism has not yet been proposed.
"As far as the proposed calculations on constructive elements are concerned, it is difficult in practice, since different technologies are often used in building buildings," he says.
It's not a secret that the storm is developing in a lot of ways because of the command.
In the opinion of the chairman of the NGO ' s 'Expert Community of Professional Hosts', Ekaterina Lesina, today the State is the most payable customer.
The Director of Engineering at Rosatoma Vladimir Malahov's Industrial Construction Centre pointed out that today the market is conditional on companies with access to the contract portfolio and companies with monopoly and non-competitors.
He believed that the creation of a transparent market could only be achieved if access to contracts would be guaranteed as much as possible by the manager.
The expert board was invited to form a host order system in such a way that the same performer was not entitled to receive more than one contract in excess of 1 billion rubs or several contracts in excess of 1 billion rubs.
The mysterium believes that this approach needs to be assessed in terms of the impact on business, as well as the efficiency of construction management.
As Elena Zukov explained, in that case, the customer would have to be assigned the role of the contractor, which would result in an increase in the customer ' s staffing and budgeting.
In this way, the contracting authority will need to have knowledge to assess the quality and safety of the work carried out by the executives.
It will often be necessary to identify who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may result in the flow of high-skilled customers due to the lack of interest in receiving a public order for the incomplete amount of work and the small amount of contract.
The Chapters of the Expert Advisory Centre of the Institute of Procurement, Alexander Eustashenkok, believe that the order procedure has now become a business game to the attention of the contractor.
And he cited this example: "participating in filling the application should indicate "specific indicators" without indicating the words "or equivalent", "should be", "oh", "better", "less", "less", "similar", "or", "type", "not below", "under", "higher", "maybe", "maybe", "maybe", "before", "not above", "not above", "not allowed" etc.
Thus, contracting parties often abuse their right to impose requirements for the content of an application submitted by management organizations.
Another problem of 44-FZ was, in Eustashhenkova's view, that it was still necessary to assess the quality of the application for work through the participant ' s " papery" proposal.
In considering the participant ' s application, only the contractor ' s qualifications, but not the quality of the work that has not yet begun, can be really assessed, the expert believes.
Quality of work can only be assessed upon receipt.
The expert board was also invited to transfer marginal income from the top to the bottom echelon to disappear from intermediate contractors.
The Chairman of the Expert Board, Status Secretary, FAS Commander Andrei Carikovski believes that this is not worth the effort, since a gender contractor should be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, it's going to be like, in the known reception of Arkadia Raine's Atele: "Is there a charge for the cowards?"
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip again went back to school on Monday after summer in bomb shelters when rockets and mines dropped on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed while the territory was being restored after the war.
The start of school sessions brought joy and excitement to the inhabitants of southern Israel, but the consequences of the hostilities remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, Pashsh, where the rocket was dropped, removed traces of cracks from walls and children's pits prior to the arrival of the students.
"We are a little scared, but we look forward to the future," said Ronit Bart, the resident of Kibuza Saad, and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to go back to a moderate life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said the second time she started going back to school was a little weird.
"It was a difficult time, and we didn't leave our homes at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibutz, which is located near the border with Gaza, to express his support.
Before the ceasefire agreement ended last week, thousands of border residents, such as Saad, were not on the street or left their homes, moving to safer areas away from the Gaza Strip to save themselves from rocket and mine fire.
Many Nahal Oz residents, living near the border with Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed in a Palestinian mine section, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderota, a city on the border with Gaza, which was very old for the Palestinian fire.
He advised his children to study diligently and said, "We will do our utmost to provide you with knowledge and security."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an endless peace last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to hostilities, but the remaining key issues remained, such as Hamas ' claim to remove the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to put up weapons and bring back the bodies of two Israelite soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, including three quarters of whom were peaceful citizens, and at least 494 children, as assessed by the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel contests these figures and claims that at least half of the people killed were warriors; however, it did not provide substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the war, Hamas and other Gazan fighters released 4591 units of rockets and mines in Israeli cities, mainly in the southern part of the country.
The Israeli army, at the time, carried out over 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of the Israeli attacks, thousands of homes were damaged and destroyed in the Gaza Strip, and 250,000 people were estimated to be sheltered in more than 100 schools, which were transformed into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and the fight continued, education officials postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon be opened so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gazan schools.
According to popular price criteria, the price for real estate was the highest winter growth in seven years.
The housing price index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for housing prices in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, RP reported on Monday.
This increase has resulted in a total increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent higher than the two-month increase in August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed throughout the country.
RP Research Director Data Tim Louless reported that Sydney and Melbourne had a two-level market.
The RP Data figures show that in Sydney housing prices have increased by 16.1 per cent over the last year, while in Melbourne, 11.7 per cent.
Next to market power was Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices averaged from five to six per cent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, where government expenditures were reduced, with prices rising by only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Louless said that, when spring began, there would be an increase in the number of real estate items displayed for sale over the next few months, which would be a “test” for the market.
"In view of the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current low interest rate conditions, it is likely that the value of the housing will still increase in the next three months," he said.
How People Live in the Oldest House in the Ufa
In the former house of gold industryers and miners Eudokima and his son Ivan Demidova on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (the former Great Kazan) 18 apartments.
The house of the 18th century had not changed from building to building, unless it had been viewed as a virtue.
Foreigners walk here as they travel, and the residents suffer more than they do from their privilege of living in the oldest Ufim house, whose walls are remembered by Colonel Alexander Suvorov.
The date of the building is incorrect, historians indicate two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it's got to be a building with no less than 300 years.
Old yard, always open door, screwing stairs.
The doors in the apartment are located close to each other, the walls are shaking, and the streets are visible in the wake of a sloppy piece of art.
It looks like it's all about being honest.
And the local people say, "You don't think so."
Living in a wooden house of the 18th century is very difficult, says Tatian Lukianov, resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is in storage, but money is not spent for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities have just forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still God-safe, but the foundation is completely destroyed.
Many lodgers are still in the bathroom on the street, and they are in public baths once a week.
How can you be content in such a situation?
The road goes straight under the windows, not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana's giving up the bait.
Now it's obvious what's been heard before: there's a stream of cars under the windows.
You see, the glass is constantly dwindling, the windows are not open, but the noise is normal.
But man is accustomed to all things, both good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to the husband, his hands are gold.
Besides, we have two rooms, we live with three sons.
And in other families, the conditions are much worse, and on the second floor, there's a lot more than half a meter high.
For Tatyana's contrast, he is offering to visit the neighbor of the apartment No. 6 of the Old Town.
A pleasantly hospitable woman with a threshold offers a cup of coffee and a thick smile tells:
We have a single room, 14.5 m2 per four people, and we live with a husband and a daughter with a granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been another place to live, and I've been surrounded by the eyes of the room: antresols, two "g" sofas; one of them has a baby with a laptop.
Very close and little is different from the usual domestic interior: only beautiful, “historical” areas.
But there is a regular flow of water: the water system is nowhere to be found.
Lumila speaks of her apartment in a round and amazing way, like the Italian house in the Roman ruins.
That's a very old and recent, everyday and legendary one:
Water supply was carried out about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in the corner and a toilet from the former hearth.
We live just once where Demidov and his family lived on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, yes and why?
At the Ufa Property Centre, they say that privatization is of no significance.
Even if we only get a one-way apartment, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, we were promised to move away, but the promise did not go on.
I'm not used to complaining, and I won't.
In this apartment (room!) was the whole dynamite: my grandmother with grandpa, my mom with dad, my husband and my daughter with granddaughter.
It's been a while.
For example, healthy crises ran through the kitchen.
Look at the flag walls, they're the meter thickness!
They say the solution was mixed in the eggs, so it's been held for so long.
The house is built on the ground floor, thank you, Demidou.
That's probably why no one's been killed by a broken plot or his own.
The construction is still slow to death in our eyes: the boards and copper houses are rotting, the fields have repeatedly collapsed, we are filling with cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say so, and there is - under our room a secret lasa and a passage to the Beloi River, which has made especially the once-living elders here, so that they can hide from danger, in case.
They've been stalked.
Manmyla Oldostina tells us how a historian came to him, asked him to let him start a digging apartment.
Then he persuaded them to give up their apartment in exchange for their one - sided copy of the October forecast.
Men's history said:
Where are we on Thursday?
And there's a little hope here that they'll give you a more spacious apartment.
If we agreed to trade, we wouldn't have won anything.
However, the Old Age's family won nothing.
The biggest dream of Ludmila to move them out, and the 16-year-old daughter gave her a separate room.
That is to say, two-room apartment has been awarded to two families instead of the greatest ruins in which two generations now live.
A nice, miniature girl, Olèse Karsakow, from apartment Nos. 11 and 12, shows the second floor of the house.
There are two close rooms with a total area of 23 m2, called apartments, and a large family lives there.
Seven of us, two of us.
See for yourself what the conditions are.
The stucco is washed with pieces, as well as windows, in the walls of the kitchen and in the rooms through the doors.
The water in the tap is cold.
Walking through the apartments of the oldest house in Ufa, we can be sure that the most successful wives were Lavrentiev's wives in apartment No. 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, places a lot!
75 square rooms, three persons.
We live just once in the rooms where Suvorov was a legend when he was staying in Ufe, says the head of the Aleksandr Dmitrievic Lavrentiev family.
So high, space.
One bad thing is, everyone's shaking around, tearing down, tearing apart.
The neighbors must have told us!
Most of all, we've had sex with them: the wooden boards have been crushed, the earth has literally gone out of its feet.
I've set up a stand, a clink; there's nothing else in the room, and in the other room we're going, like we're going up the stairs, just like we're walking.
The home of a buyer named Eudokima Demidova Alexander Dmitrievich can tell you better any route.
The gold industry is treated as a family, speaking of it with admiration.
In fact, the identity was involuntarily: the owner of Kagin and Uzian factories built a house, flowed guns and cholera, held ural mines.
The heirs of the copper property are proud of the past, but they no longer want to live under one roof with history.
I settled here as a child in the '40s, 'cause Alexander Dmitrievich said.
Then the wooden rooms for the carriage, the horseshoes, and the caravans were around, and they were then taken down.
In 1968, they wanted to clean up our house, but there was something wrong...
The story was repeated in 2014: new housing was again lost.
We, as a team, collected all the documents, avoided the necessary instances, and learned that moving to the apartment would take place in 2015 or 2016.
Something we don't believe in anymore...
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bascortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The housing officials didn't accept.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as a smile, they put out a paper without signatures and prints: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to housing".
I even felt that our home was not in the city for a long time, because first it was under number 57, then it became 57 A, and now it's 57/1.
It's like he was taken away in the '70s.
The Russian Planet has called on the leading sector to provide information and analysis of the land resources management of Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
The House on the Street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the housing program.
I cannot be responsible for the actions of the officers of the 1970s, but I know that there was a plan for all old houses at the time, despite historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities - to restore all old houses on the streets of the October Revolution of architectural value - was successful.
The residents are soon scheduled to move to new apartments.
According to Barabbas, the Dom Demidova will be restored by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of the buildings in Venice.
There is an architectural biennale in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 all of the former Old Kazan Street will be restored, says the officer.
The house will have a suitable type, corresponding to what was before, three centuries ago.
The house of Demidov is likely to be a museum open to all who wish.
In addition, a decision was made at the Government level to make the street on the day of departure.
Unfortunately, there will not be too much road congestion in the city.
Moving people away from the future museum Vladimir Barabash promises in 2015.
However, they will hardly be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same place as the present one.
It's just from the second time.
Forest fires started in the Baltic Sea
The drought caused a forest fire in the territory of Ohotničy region in the Fire Region of the Baltic Sea.
There is an increase in the pooling of forces and funds.
According to the Chief Executive Officer of the Premora Air Force, the conditions created at the site of fire require the involvement of the aviation forces.
Vasili Medvedev, Deputy Chief of Air Force:
A fire that occurred in a difficult location was found by an observer on board an An-2 patrol aircraft at 3 hectares.
They're burning the woody remains on the old burner.
The strong paralysis of the territory and the steep slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable fire extinguishers, poses significant difficulties in the sewer.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The delivery of the forces at the base of the Mi-2 helicopter and the An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
Four fire-fighting parachutists were quickly fired after detection of the fire at the site of the shower.
The main task of the professionals is to extinguish the fire and to prepare the space for the delivery of additional force and means of fire.
In the area of lunch in the village of Ochotnichi, 3 fire-fighting depots have been added.
As soon as the helicopter is ready to land in the area of fire, the experts will be transferred to the shower site, reports the Primordial Administration.
Lenny Henry: My father never deceived me.
He never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to immigrants from Jamaica to Dadley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry repeats the comedy, “Rady’s Rare Plastics”, which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and has grown from a series of radio 4 transmissions.
Soundtrack is a mixture of tails and tails, and the tunes are life-suffering.
However, Henry had to go through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother died, there was a lot of treatment, besides, Henry often thinks about his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've just heard his voice say, "Stop the noise.
Stay away from your sister.
Move!
I want to see the cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, went to the pub with him and talked about such things as the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of the cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such an unimaginable guy in the corner who read the newspaper most of my life.
Henry recently opened up a Lithuanian master's degree in Dadly and, although conditions were better than his father's day, he was able to look at what his life must have been like.
Now it's a little better, but it's dark, smokeless, deep labyrinths of the underworld with the flames of fire and smoke and the dog's horn.
My father walked into the bathroom and was just lying there, and you heard him sing about himself slowly because he wanted to get rid of the Lithuanian master.
When I got there, I realized that he had done this for years and years to earn us food, and I came to appreciate him more.
However, Henry left his childhood of abandoned parental love.
My father never cheated, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got bad at the very end of her life did we start to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Frank, allowed him to share the love that he did not embrace as a child.
Can you stop that "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Don Frank.
Why don't you make me friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still good friends with France, where he was married for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I just hang out with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of the ones who killed her.
So when I was very, very well corrected and I had diabetes symptoms, my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.
Then I started serious exercise with fitness, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
No one's a murderer.
The shift in Henry's career trajectory may be reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
From the time he received recognition of criticism for his Otello, he was fully involved in the theater.
She followed the "Comedy Error" and then the "Labors" of August Wilson.
This work differs from that of the net and comets that were an inalienable attribute of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
Didjey noticed how he was born on the stage, and wrote about it in the "New People".
His career on TV began in the middle of the seventies: "For a long time I was the only black paradox/comist on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in the audience, I had to learn to be an effective slot machine between 1975 and 1985, as a star, working on television, and that was very difficult.
Lenny in New Persons in 1975
Since his manager had the right to "Black and White Men's Show", an easy entertainment program in which people "blacked their faces", Henry found out what he was doing in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I kind of wish it never was with me, but I don't regret what I did.
Although this was a strange, worthy position, I worked in large areas and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "the award of an easy-to-use classroom on British television for years and years" was also "grotesque parade on black people".
By presenting characters that were also published over the black culture in the United Kingdom and which were successful, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the 1980s.
The first season of "Show Lenny Henry" was broadcast in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as, among other things, Chief of the Garrett Blackock comic series "Chef!".
The commercial roles, documentary films, teleseries and roles in the movie took the next ten years of his life, but after his show at the BBC in 2008, "Lenny Henry.tv," he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it doesn't seem like you're wasting time or effort on the side."
There was also a series of documentary transmissions on Radio 4 entitled "What's good at...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.
You can't tell me to be so taught at school, and I thought it was, in many ways, a high-school white man with a cologne and a hood down the front.
So I was really scared of him.
All we did was take an interview with Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, and they said, "You have to try.
Don't worry about it until you know what you're talking about.
Listen to some of those words, and you'll understand why we still love Shakespeare.
Henry read 20 sections of the last monologue of Otello for the documentary transmission, and he's stuck.
I feel like I can do this.
Somehow my head was fixed.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, it's a serious matter, study your text, do a little research.
So, the rehearsal process was tough, and I read it for months and months before we put it in.
And she was successful.
They said they were waiting for disasters, and it didn't happen.
We're about to start the error comedy.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical flaw, and Henry instinctively felt that his case was to distract the audience.
"Your voice inside me said, "You'll have to work for 10 minutes while they're running a computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would be resumed as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the scene and something in me said, "Oh, glory to God."
It's not my duty.
I can let someone else understand that.
"You play play, stay in the role."
Henry in "Saborah" at the Dachness Theatre
It was difficult to study the text for the "Talks".
Panic is useful enough, it strengthens muscle.
They took it well, too, so it was like a sign that said, "Here's what you need to do."
He said that, of course, with a broad voice.
So I'm holding on to it.
I really love it.
I love being in the reception room.
In fact, Henry's still thinking of comics is that the whole way of our conversation is going down the cracks of his mood when he starts, he ends up paradoxing.
I just decided not to work at the stand 'cause this thing with a instant payout from the whole stranger's room, I think it's pretty dangerous.
If you're trying to do this all the time, it could lead to a pitfall.
I sometimes work in the Right Air in Apollo when I want, but mostly I don't get the pleasure as I used to.
I'm asking if he's going to give the stand one more time.
The joy of sitting in the room with the director, who helps to give shape to the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I'll ever want to give up on it.
So that's his new engagement?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice party.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place for it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers public servants to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya has started a biometric registration of all government officials in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the Government ' s payment statement.
Employees who are not registered within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, are reported in the Government statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive wages after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Kenya promised to reduce corruption in public structures after he came to power in 2013.
The audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month was spent on “invisible workers” and other financial irregularities.
The Government suspects that payments continue to be made to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves public service, reports BBC Reporter Vanyam Cebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All public servants must appear within the identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure, the Government statement states.
Any person who fails to do so without due cause will be removed from the payment statement, it shall be reported in it.
“This procedure significantly improves the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clear a payment statement at both levels of government, thus ending the problem of “invisible workers”, said Ann Wiigur, the Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers for Planning and Structure of Government.
Tens of Turkish police officers arrested in connection with the “contract” against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of “a conspiracy against the Government”, local information agencies reported.
The police did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, reports Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them had participated in the corruption detection activities in December, which had been directed at the verification of government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish policemen were arrested on suspicion of establishing an organized criminal group and hearing the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan (at the time the Prime Minister) identified their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others under the authority of the Islamic clergyman Fatholha Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer canals.
This day is traditionally a major event for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsien Yacenuk took his daughter to school.
There he told reporters expected that not all schools had been reopened, but that he would do everything possible to protect the country for future generations:
The ceremony was not held in every school on 1 September.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The entire Ukraine, a huge single Ukrainian national front, must fight for the peace sky.
Alexan Pastuhov, director of the school in Slavyanska, where the daughter of Yacenuka spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of study is traditionally observed by children who wear high - quality clothing, hold air glasses in their hands, and give their teachers flowers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead BBC, she may have found such an impressive leader as she needs.
It is followed by a wave of fame from the world of banking, media management and the internal affairs of the Tori party.
In fact, she has her own work experience in leadership.
Its career began at the Global Management Advisory Company Bain and Co, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and at Pearsons.
She was the Head of the Financial Times for seven years, retired when a senior member of Pearson's was hired by a lower-ranking male colleague.
It is said that its earnings are approaching £1 million.
Its political rating is also clear.
She recommended that David Cameron Lord Brown, a former head of BP when he tried to bring private sector experts to Whitehall: she became a consultant to the Cabinet of Ministers.
Her husband is an ex-advisor, Tori.
Earlier in May, I called the president of the poisoned glass.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two directions: within the BBC itself, the senior management hierarchy, but I will be outside as a voice of public concern and concern when something goes wrong.
This is almost a lack of duopolis, which requires full radical reform.
However, which new president would risk coming, breaking and destroying the institution as difficult as the Chinese dynamite, if he had given up his own business in this process.
It's a difficult decision.
It would not be so difficult, many people would be pleased to see how the BBC will decrease in size, after reviewing its credentials, finances and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies raise the challenge of familiar old habits, inevitable negotiations on the value of the licence pose a special risk to the BBC.
For a modest amount of £145.50 a year, the British acquire a share of the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it states that the results of its work cover 96 per cent of households and each of them stands at 40p per day.
Moreover, it is evident that Beeb's popularity is growing: 53 per cent are currently supporting it against 31 per cent 10 years ago.
The viewing and use of BBC models have changed: now I get news headlines on the mobile phone and watch missing programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and exciting institution.
He needs an impressive president - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says a humiliating tweet was written by someone else
Twitter, from the confirmed account of Governor Texas of the Republic of Rick Perry, contained a deplorable picture of the district prosecutor of the Democrats in the centre of criminal prosecution of the abuse of power on Sunday night.
Twitter was later removed, followed by another Perry account, in which this record was disassessed.
Only a tweet was published from my account that was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I took it off," the later recording said.
Perry's assistants did not respond immediately to the request for comments.
Although the records were loaded from Perry's confirmed account, it was unclear who was actually publishing in that tape.
Earlier on, the tweet contained a minor cartoon for the prosecutor of Travis Rosemary Lemberg County, who was found to be responsible for driving in a state of pollution in April 2013.
Perry imposed a ban on the financing of her agency when she refused to resign, which led to the trial of a large jury in Austin this month against Perry, who was a potential candidate for the presidential election in 2016.
Your signature says, "I don't always drive a car in a state of shock three times the permissible level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do, I blame Governor Perry for what he tells me about it."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg authorities did not conduct an investigation involving a large jury against Perry.
They took care of Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry did not acknowledge himself guilty and called himself a political prisoner.
His powerful legal team had asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, stating that the law used to prosecute the governor who had been in charge for a long time throughout the history of Texas was contrary to the Constitution.
Perry has stopped funding $7.5 million from state resources to the State Control Division, which is based in Travis County, and is pursuing corruption in the public sector of Texas, when Lemberg refused to retire.
The veto called for an official complaint from a left-wing monitoring group.
Perry's confirmed account chain is often updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
At the fifth party in Iowa during its 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to the news that he could get out of the game, published a tweet with his photo running near the lake, and said, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to normal
One of London's most well-known devices warned that the real estate market in South-East England had returned to the normal level of activity.
The house in the capital was the subject of renewed demand and rising prices, and there was widespread fear that the credit bubble would force the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pijgli, the founder and president of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "From the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to the normal level of transactions since peak 2013, adding that it has provided a "stable working environment".
The London real estate market was successful in the fall since foreign buyers went to the capital.
The city's prices jumped by 18.5 per cent last year, according to the Land Survey, significantly increased the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
The average market prices for the private, accessible and student schemes of Berkeley increased by about one fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of which have also stopped the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around the potential " special " tax" before the next May general elections.
The London real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market reform, which introduced stricter loan conditions, would also lead to a decrease in market growth, both in the sale-purchase transaction and in the second half of the year.
The Bank of England's fresh data showed a drop in the number of approved mortgage loans in June on Monday, leading to further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its forecast growth in London real estate by up to 3 per cent in 2015 on the basis that the price adjustment has already begun to decrease.
Transactions in the past period fell to 4 compared with the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Maefer and Kensington, according to the WA Ellis.
However, the demand for a home in the capital has proved very beneficial to Berkeley, raising sales of more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pigley added: "The demand for the necessary goods with good design and better location remained old and, reflecting this, sales remained for a time."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3742 new houses this year by the end of April - almost a third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
The annual income for tax payments rose by 40 per cent compared to the previous year to £380 million, income by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
Speaking on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr. Pijgli said that the expected revenues of Berkeley would be in line with current market expectations this year.
In the unanimous opinion of the analysts, income is expected for a full year before tax is paid in £450 million.
Berkeley's stock was held at £23.96 on the second afternoon at the London Stock Exchange.
Photo posted by Jennifer Lawrence on the internet hacker
Jennifer Lawrence attends the 85th annual award ceremony of the American Film Academy.
Photographs by the heavily charged actress Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Oscar Award, were posted on the Internet hacker, which ensures that the “catalogue” has 100 more uplifting stars.
The star star "Golden Games" confirmed that the photographs of Lawrence are present and condemned the hacker for "sudden invasion into private space".
The law enforcement authorities have been consulted and will be prosecuted by anyone who publishes stolen photographs of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the site exchange photos of 4chan were allegedly obtained due to the lack of the Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "catalog" of victims of burglary includes dozens of women, including Ryanna, Kim Cardassian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It's not clear how many of these photographs are real, although Scott Pilgrim's star against all of them, Winsted in Twitter also condemned the riot.
"The one who looks at the pictures that we took with his husband a few years ago when he came home -- I hope you're proud," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victoria victor" denied that in the photos she wrote in Twitter: "These so-called photos of me, FALSHIVIKI, people.
Let me stop this in the backyard.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that the representative of the Aryan Grande pop star denied that the photos on which she was supposed to be real were true.
An exclusive passage from the new novel by Howard Jacobsson about the love and the letter "J", which sparked criticism
They were dissolved, the best they could say is that they gradually collapsed, like a box that was left under the rain.
Only at times did a woman tell him that he was too serious, heavy in society, tense, closed, and perhaps a little upset.
And then she held his hand.
He saw himself angry.
He was rolling like a tag, yeah.
The last victim of this bunny was a little novel he expected more than usual, deliverance from solitary and boring life and perhaps even some pleasure.
Eileen Solomons was blushed with beautiful hairy and trembling hearts from the northern island village, even more distant and rougher than Port Royben.
She came south with a satellite older than herself, whom Kevern considered to be her aunt, and the last one had inherited a house in cheese, but looked like a paradise valley called "The Paradise Valley".
No one lived in the house for a few years.
The pipes flowd, in the bathrooms, and the spiders left their tracks on all the windows, confident that their home belonged to them; the garden was filled with sour and sour, like giant hips.
It was like a catage from a children's book, at the same time frightening and charming, full of mystery garden.
Author's opinion: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included in the Long List of the Bucharest Prize in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week
Kevin and Eileen sat behind their hands, in broken grass in the middle of a high grass, enjoying an unexpected hot spring day; they were both dissatisfyingly connected to the cheap console that provided the country with dying music and soothing news, when he remembered the old song of a long - forgotten black performer who loved to listen to his father, leaving the towns in the house.
You've got too many legs.
Because of their aggression, such songs on the consoles were no longer played.
They were not prohibited - nothing was actually forbidden - just no longer played them.
They were helped to become archaic, just like the word "archaic".
The public taste did what it would never have been possible to obtain by orders and regulations, and just as people among the books chose rich people who grew up in poverty, culinary books, and love novels, they chose ballads from all over the music.
On that day, Kevin began to play on the imaginary piano and with a rough comical voice to heal Elynn's big legs.
Eileen didn't get it.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he said to her, putting two fingers in her pocket.
So his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she got rid of his mouth.
It started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father was playing with his father as he told him.
Start with "J", forget to apply two fingers to your mouth, and it'll be worth a penny.
It wasn't very fun at the time, and it wasn't very fun right now.
He knew it was what he was waiting for, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard of him.
Also, jazz was not played, even though it was not open.
The improvisation came out of fashion.
There's only one "yes" left in life.
When the melody began, people wanted to know exactly where it was going to end.
It's exactly the same with the rigour.
His unpredictability had an effect on people’s nerves.
And jazz was an instrument expressed by music.
Although he was 10 years old, he never heard of Sammy Davis Young, Kevern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But even if he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Considering her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no law or pressure.
The community was obedient, and that meant that each of its segments agreed with gratitude, thanks to those who had preserved their fate, with the principle of group preference.
People of the Afro-Caribbean background on temperament and physical characteristics were well-approached for entertainment and sport - and they sang and ran.
Exiters from Indonesia, as if by nature talented in all electronics, were taken to ensure that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was used in Santech; what was left of the Greek was plates.
Exiters from the Persian Gulf and Leviathan, whose grandfathers did not hesitate to leave the country when TO, WHAT THE PROCEEDINGS, IF THE GENERAL PROCEEDINGS had taken place, in fear of being accused of burning flames, in fear of saying that the flame would swallow them next, opened the restaurants with mud and caliphs, did not stand out, and did not stand out.
Everyone's capable.
Since she had heard only the ballads before, Eileen found it hard to understand how insulting words that she had just lost could be put on music at all.
Music is the expression of love.
"They're really not insulting," said Kevin.
Or maybe for people with big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the garden that was planted gave him a security illusion.
No word could go through the sound of giant leafy leaves.
Eileen didn't understand.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say that it was a joke, but he didn't want to touch her again with two fingers.
She thought it was weird.
"He thought it was funny," he said instead.
She raised her head incredibly, closed up Keverna's review.
There was nothing in the world but the dust of her black hair.
Nothing I'd like to look at.
"Well, if you say so," she said, remaining in her opinion.
But that doesn't explain why you eat it to me anyway.
It was said that she was really upset.
Do I have too many legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
The drawers, maybe, can hear...
And you're saying you hate me because my boots are too fat?
Do I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you because you've got a fat spoon," he tried to say instead.
I've got this kind of delusion.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
He was often tempted to remain silent because, like his father, he lacked the calming promise that could alleviate the harshness of his jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevin, wanted it.
In spite of good eyes.
Eileen Solomons adorned and stood up with a scissors, smashing the console and pouring the wine they drank.
Wine from his pockets, so the drink could not serve as an excuse.
In her excitement, she seemed to be shaking like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"And I like you because you have a stupid head," she said...
You don't like it, though.
He felt sorry for her and for the harshness of her words, and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she gave him her resistance.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in a cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that she was basically like this.
The same huge ice ocean hit both of them.
The same men, more sensitive and capricious than their ancestors, smugglers, and destroyers, were in the rage of the pope in the pub, ready to raise their hand against any woman who dared to refuse or insult them.
A stupid head?
They'd have shown her a stupid doll if she hadn't been careful!
First of all, the kiss is now the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; then, the opposite of the fresh ballads that issued the console is to kiss her and then hit her.
More specific, in the view of Kevin, because kissing on your own was already a hooliganism.
Eileen Solomons, a corpus, showed that he had to leave.
He got up out of the living room like an old man.
She felt the lead gravity herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him walk out, and she saw him walk out of the window, her satellite was a man who was carrying a burden on himself.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt compassion for him and for men at all, even though some of them raised their hand.
The man who turned away from her, with his back, bent, beaten, all his ability to fight left him; why did she think that she knew this so well if she could not remember any of the events until this day when she saw it?
Again, an Eileen Solomons looked at his feet.
Twenty years before the events described above, or about that Esme Nusbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked in Ofnau, an informal community control service, prepared a small report on the maintenance of low and medium levels of violence in the same parts of the country where it was expected to be reduced if it did not cease, taking into account the resources and forces allocated to its eradication.
“A lot has been done, and much is done,” she wrote, “to alleviate the vicious aggression of people who fought in thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these scattered orchards and narrow settlements, where, despite the rainstorms of church caves, the gentle breathing of human goodness has rarely been felt throughout history.
However, some qualities appear to be inescapable.
The higher the level, the lower the passions it produces.
The population has tears over sentimental ballads, has stories of overcoming obstacles, and proclaims their lack of faith in a good marriage and family life, but not only has old-fashioned rudeness maintained its strong grip on rural communities and urban settlements, but there is also evidence that new and evil ravages are born in homes, in workplaces, in roads and even in playgrounds.
"You have a boring habit of writing too much," said her scientist, reading the entire report.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nusbaum has lost his head.
I also have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think you have to answer," said Esme Nusbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on his right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
It's a silence again.
"I ask," said Luther Rabinovic, "not because I oppose atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We don't have any preconceived ideas here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitive, absolutely acceptable and commendable on their own, can sometimes distort the results, such as what you showed me.
It is obvious that you yourself are prejudiced against the church, and what you call "bad" and "bad", others would interpret as an expression of natural love and energy.
To continue to worry about what is going on, if it is going on, as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, means to leave the country that it needed life force.
Esme Nusbaum looked at the sides while Rabinovic spoke.
Behind his head, the pink, like the Flamingos, were repeated by the lighted letters that Ofnau has given to the country in the last four centuries or more.
Smile to your neighbor, your wife's prices, listen to the ballads, go to the music, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
A word of silence is better, a word of song is better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you want to say," said Esme Nusbaum quietly, when she was satisfied that her scientist had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't been treated as effectively as we believe.
I am concerned that if we are not ready, we will find that we repeat the mistakes that have originally led to TOM, what IS going on, if it is going on.
Only this time will we throw out our anger and lack of confidence in others.
Luther Rabinovic joined his fingertips in the pyramid.
This gesture must have meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "called the "mistakes" of actions that our grandfathers have done or have not done.
You go too far and when you say they've thrown out their anger and "infidelity" on others.
In your place, people shouldn't need to remember that, having understood the past, that is protecting the present, we're not talking about us and about them.
There was no "us" and there was no "other".
It was a time of trouble -- that's all we know.
"For which, if you're honest with yourself," dared to insert Esme, "we can't justify ourselves any part of society.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what was done was done.
Then it was.
There's nothing more to say - here we agree.
And if you don't have to blame anyone, you don't have to justify it, if that's appropriate, or if there's something you can fix.
But why did it happen if it wasn't for studying?
The past is for us to forget him.
If I could add one word to that,
The pyramid of Luther Rabinovica is broken.
"I'll consider your record," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on the road to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who went on a road trip, as described by the passing man, "in an angry rage."
The collisions are happening.
Army Lesotho claims that the revolution was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The representatives of the Lesotho army objected to the development of a revolution to turn the Government away, stating that they were acting against the police, who were suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, claiming that the country ' s army had surrounded his official residence and had seized government buildings in Maseru.
The Prime Minister introduced his family to neighboring South Africa, saying he had been threatened with temptation for his life.
Major Ntlele Ntoi's army said that there was not really a turning around, but that the army responded to the threat of "political fanatics", which the police were trying to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the command of the Lesotho Armed Forces has taken action, having received several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police that really plan to arm some political, young fanatics who were prepared to create chaos," he told the Voice of America.
A representative of the South African Government, Clayson Monjela, said that the military actions looked like a turning point.
"No one has filed a claim to be seized by the force, according to all information, the actions of the Lesotho armed forces at present have major signs of conversion," he said.
Lesotho army officials reported that the soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was quiet.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mottjoa Metsing manages the Government in the absence of Tabana.
Taban stated that he believed that he was being attacked in connection with an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June when Tabané suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in his joint Government.
He stated that his actions had not been undermined by the Government, despite the accusations in return.
The Chelsea Protector, Marco van Ginkel, will hold the upcoming season on the right to rent in Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutch will be in Italy in the next few hours to conduct a medical examination.
In the past season, he went to the London Club field only three times.
Remember, Milan used to hire the Liverpool attacker Fernando Torres.
Eurozone production at the lowest rate in 13 months
Production growth in the eurozone slowed down to the lowest 13 months in August, according to popular research.
The last value of the euro area production index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, with a decrease of 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were held, and enterprises were affected by the growing tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
The values were before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
The markets will expect the bank to have a clear plan on how to stop the recovery of the eurozone, as well as on the threat of inflation of only 0.3 per cent.
There is a assumption that the ECB leader Mario Dragi can give additional signals later this week that he is considering a scheme of quantification for the eurozone similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although some growth is better than any growth, the braking effect of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more evident," said Robert Dobson, senior economist Markit.
Germany's production sector PMI, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest 11 months of note 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second-largest economy of the bloc, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to raise concern as well as the weakening of Italy from stable growth to stagnation.
The recognition that the momentum of the growth of emissions in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, does not add any confidence," said Mr. Dobson.
The slowdown in industry is likely to be further fuelled by analysts waiting for additional monetary or budgetary incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where SMEs grew to 57.3, at its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the chief economist of IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say is that the August study of the Eurozone industry's business activity index is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: “The eurozone producers are obviously finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension, especially in connection with Russia/Ukraine, adds uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increase in tension has obviously hit business - and especially consumer confidence - and is likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially major orders.
He said that "more and more like," that the ECB would eventually have to carry out some variety of quantitative mitigation, "we suspect that it will be limited."
The people of Mariupola are showing a live chain against the cops
In Mariúpolis before last week, it was all quiet - no one was going to organize the Mariúpolis People’s Republic, the city lived and worked on the Asian Sea.
Now the inhabitants are looking forward to the arrival of the "policemen".
According to politicians, separatists are breaking into Mariúpolis to go to the Azov Sea, recently taken into the city of Novozazovsk, which has not previously been part of the self-declared republics.
The Mariúpolisians decided that the Ukrainian army would protect them, although it had a little power against the well-armed representatives of the DNR-LNR, and had gathered to help the military.
They're tearing down the trenches, building blocks and strengthening.
On Saturday evening, a few thousand people came to the eastern border of the city and stood there in a living cell, singing the hymns of Ukraine.
They're going to do the same when they get in.
Volunteers collect and drive equipment and products, collect medicines, publish the newspaper.
In the city, shops are gradually closed, banks and ATMs are shut down.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the bitter grasp of the school, like the children in it still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen fighters at a school in Beslane, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were killed during this three-day trial that shook the world
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated on death at the church.
Just ten years later, after the terrible capture of the Beslan school, during which 334 people, including 186 children, were killed, the heroic catastrophe was warned yesterday evening about the new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, seized and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, this seemed to be a kind of extreme possible evil.
The tragedy brought the east and the west together in the reverse, which then miraculously increased in action and hope for the future in the face of the worst of woes.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to southern Russia to find some of the victims who had lied to death during the crime at school.
We have found wonderful young people who have endured adversity, although the memories of the terrorist Ada will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now being waged against Ukraine, in which children like them are being killed, will now cease.
A girl who is trying to take back to the shooting hall
It was printed on a picture of a well-known Russian photographer Dmitria Belakov, when one of the whites tried to get back to the shooting hall after the mine exploded.
In the wasteland of Aida, she desperately wanted her mother, Larissa, now 40.
They were afraid they died, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run beyond all the forces, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My legs were covered with blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
Soldiers improved her and took her to a safe place.
After surgery, she thought she had recovered completely, but yesterday she said, "The pain has returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
Several cuts remained in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people the way doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but of course it has not broken it," she says with a challenge.
"This has happened to me, and this cannot be changed.
Once a year, I always go to this sports hall to remind everyone who's still there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it the other day.
It's too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my roommate, was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my schooling and start working.
I'll think about the family then.
She says that the memory stays with her, even though the memories are a little dusty every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our misery, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from Britain and everywhere.
When I see a photo on the Internet, where I go to the school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy, and make sure it doesn't happen again.
The boy who ran through the city of the bullet, thinking his mother was dead.
It was his first day in school (the Russians started school at age 7) and survived three days of capture, covering their mother Tamara.
Then he had seven, and he said, "My mother told me to treat her if she was to explode and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She told him to run.
Fearing that she was dead, he ran away and saw a crying little boy on the road, grabbed the child by his hand, and ran across the city with a bullet.
His father, Vladimir, who caught his son outside, said, "Damir told me his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was released and was in a hospital with leg injuries, in turn thinking that her son had died.
After they were reunited, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now a non-existent newspaper News of the World), where he was awarded as a Child Protection Officer from the Bernardo's Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sheri.
"That horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
Still, I can tell you that I remember him in the dark.
I remember how soon after that, I threw out all my toys.
But now I can play computer games with a gun, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played in the yard with that I didn't choose.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially a toy store, where I was allowed to choose everything I wanted, and a trip to a car with an open top.
But now he's afraid of places like Ukraine where wars lead to a fire that he and his friends have survived.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who last week was doing volunteer work in a women's monastery.
That's how I want to help.
I want to serve with the police at any time, and I hope they'll take me to the Academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the yellow silence immediately after the capture, there were just no children who would scream and run around, and that silence continued for months.
She will remember her trip to London with Damir.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I realized that people at the other end of the earth could understand our feelings, support them.
She was grateful "Sherry Blair and her fund for that prize and the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.
I'd like to call Sherry and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damira and me.
I remember how when Damir wanted to eat the beard, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the officers at the restaurant, Damir shot them with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And the whole month went by after our nightmare then.
I was amazed that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I don't think this world has gotten any better than these 10 years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of kids have been killed and killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for many people the war is a news report that they hear when they're bored or when they're busy.
I just know that these people feel terrible about it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he was not aggressive or bad at all.
He's not looking for places, for example, he's not surrounded by this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they're going to the sports hall from time to time and they're burning candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it. I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw out all his weapons and other military toys.
I find it hard to believe that I've been so sure for a few hours that he's dead and that I'll never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked and saw hell around me when parts of the body were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember screaming to him, "Damir, run away," but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and escaped.
This life continues for us, unlike so many others.
Georgia Illin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photo after the capture became a determining factor for the tragedy in Beslane
Peace: survived Beslan Georgie Ilin with his mother Fatima after her arrest in 2004, and Georgia's case today
His wounded face was a sign of fear when he was rescued from death when Czech terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, aged 54, took him to school on the first day of school before taking the older son of Vladimir to university.
"I left in two minutes before the terrorists fled into the court, so my little boy remained one for three days of nightmare," she recalled.
Not even one, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia survived.
The closer this date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
It's not a day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of those days in front of me all the time.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
It strikes in the soul: Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was forever in sculpture (right)
I remember Georgie so wanted to go to school the day she said she wanted to take the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And even now there's a sculpture of crying Georgia in San Marino.
George doesn't like to look at this picture, and it's hidden in the bookshop at our house.
I understand, but I also think that this photograph makes people from all over the world feel our pain.
Georgia now says, "It's important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never know the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boing violation in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what it was called?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, no one wants war, because it happens?
Ten years, nothing for that pain.
We need ten years to forget her a little.
She affected my health, and I still feel her.
I've had nightmares about three or four years, but now it's getting better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That is why I continue to go to this sports hall before 1 September.
I want to remind my old friends of my childhood.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like I'm a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget about it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life continues.
I graduated from school this year and went to a medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I'll learn to be a cardiosurgeon.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I didn't let my health go.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't happen.
Georgia Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived, despite what was in the terrorist killer's leg.
Incredibly: Georgie Farniev was at the foot of a terrorist killer in the time of his capture, but he was able to survive.
At the time of his arrest, he was photographed in a sports hall next to a bomb at the foot of a terrorist-killer.
Actually, it's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We think it was yesterday," said Georgie, who wanted to study at the FSB intelligence officer, but failed because of the damage caused by his health during his arrest.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they're saying that kids are easily dealing with bad things, and I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, for the next year, it was the first and last time I entered this sports hall again.
I've lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show where I was sitting on this famous photograph.
Survivor: Georgie Farniev today with an open photo of himself in the hospital after arrest
My pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As for the physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm going normal.
But health did not allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical opinions, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second involvement was animal, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been studying there for two years.
He'll learn to treat all the animals from the basket to the cow.
He said, "I know that I will never tell my children about my experience.
This is not what children need to know, and of course not what they need to survive.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary is coming.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to mark it.
I know Georgie won't go.
For him it must be even stronger, because he was there, and I didn't.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help it.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me, and there's a print here in Beslane.
He's staying with us.
Georgia is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so awfully unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't take care of them because of his knees.
He's had several operations, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I'd say he'd overcome that nightmare by 50%, but it's impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This juicy experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and that only adds to my pain.
I lost a lot of people that I knew well and that were dear to me.
My son with me, and this is the best gift God could have made me, but my heart hurts for those who have been killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who never married again.
It's hard to assume that life is going on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart broke out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world, wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country right now, and I have a hard time believing that.
We were a friend in the past, how did we get to fight now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure a lot of children have been killed in Ukraine and a lot will be killed.
If you could catch all the rebels and throw them out as far as you can.
Alona Ckaeva, 10 years old
A young man who was put in a safe place by a skilled fighter
Rescued: Alonou Ckaev is a safe place for a Russian warlord (left).
She now has ten (right), and she doesn't remember a monster crime at all.
The world had stopped breathing in 2004, when a Russian police officer had taken Alyona out of an undercover school in Beslane.
Terrorists fired her, but cruelly left her 30-year-old mother, Christine's ten-year-old sister, and Brother Mahara in the school's sports hall.
Mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but Alona's mother and sister died in a deadly battle.
Her father, Ruslan, has been remarried since then, and they have his new wife, Svetlana, a little daughter he called Christina, in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alona, whom ten now remembers nothing about capture and flourishing in a smart and happy girl, says neighbors.
"They are a great happy family now, and Alona and Mahar are both beautiful children," said a close friend.
Ruslan is a beautiful father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is observed.
You can understand why.
Colonel Sinji Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Dormouse, noted that he was looking forward to being able to go back to the German club.
He said that this transfer was a happy career.
Of course, I am very glad to be playing "Borusija" again, says Bild, Kagawa.
I feel very good.
A field of positive emotions and eagerness, when I can go back to the field in the form of "Borusia".
Remember, Kagawa moved to the MIU from Beirut in 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was unable to join the English club, performing all 38 matches in the English championship for two seasons, killing 6 ball players and delivering 8 results.
A man indicted on a girl on a pedestrian crossing "Pielikan" in Fife
A 78-year-old man will be brought before the prosecution court for a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing to Fife.
Gordon Stuart was supposed to beat a girl for a ride to Pittenvina in East Newke.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stuart had taken his Audi Q3 without proper care and attention and had killed the girl, which resulted in trauma.
Stuart, 78, from Antwerp, denied his guilt at the Dandi Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, a royal lawyer, appointed the date of the court in January.
Obama, Merkel, and Holland don't go to Vladivostok
The Vladivostok Duty Free Airport Free Trade Store set up a table banning the purchase of a number of world political leaders.
They will not be distracted by spirits, water, and horses.
The Office of the Shop decided that the President of the United States, Barack Obama, Chancellor FRG Angela Merkel, President of France François Olland, Vitaly Klicko, Julia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other well-known associates would not be able to dispose of water, horses and spirits in their stores.
And she put the appropriate plate on the door.
Obama had previously been banned from appearing in the less accessible form of the establishment service, the Diet Table ICU, as reported by the Society ' s establishment site.
Whether the U.S. President had ever dreamed of eating at a diet table in Russia is unknown, but the authors of the ban seem to be extremely aggressive.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave counsel to the agrarians
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that under the embargo, Russian agrarians should develop new technologies in order to generate the release of required cheese varieties to buyers.
The Council was given during the visit of the company "Jugpticeprom" agrocomplex".
The Government ' s head also advised the restaurants to refocus on Russian meat, which is well-quality.
The annual food import embargo has been introduced in Russia since 7 August.
The main coach of the Russian assembly Valentin Maslavov is pleased with the outcome of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, third place is a good result, given the lack of targeted training for competitions.
Our sportsmen have spoken at their level, says "All sports" Maslavova.
The third is the confirmation of our high level of command.
It is a pleasure that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
It should be borne in mind that we were not prepared for these competitions.
The season is over, and we have not committed our leaders to participating in the DecaNation Cup.
In recent years we have become the second at this tournament, but in this season we have the collection renewed.
The French, on the other hand, displayed a military team of 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which they made a number of public announcements.
But even such a composition of rivals could not stand against the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have spoken in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were in order below the same Brilliant League.
The season is over.
Of course, sportsmen are no longer so important in the competitions at the command level.
The main place here was the place.
And according to the results, there was an absurdity when men were so involved in the tactical escapes at 1500 meters, that they showed the result below the average... of women's escapes.
4 Tips on improving the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to take a photo or take a video under the water, you have a variety of options.
The cheapest option is a waterproof mill, e.g. Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an echo camera, e.g. GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these pictures on a family holiday with a couple of cameras, all at about $350.
Regardless of the equipment you are using, there are several rules that need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery camera and other compartments are fully closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you're going to take.
Some cameras have collection modes or object types that optimize exposure to dark underwater conditions.
And before you get into the water, find out how deep your equipment can go.
Some cameras are only counted at 5 feet, others at 50 or 60 feet.
See our customer guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few photos, because many of them won't get.
There's a D.C.D. that's gonna help you make photos, when there's usually no one in the echo camera.
Even if you have a CCD, it will be difficult to see it under the water, and the composition of the staff will be a random process.
So do a few things.
Also, if your camera has a serial collection mode that takes several staff with a little different exhibition facilities, use them.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light is significantly lower than the depth of water you dive.
If possible, stay on the surface when you are taking pictures in the pool, river or ocean.
This will also allow you to pass more colors on the photos; the deeper you go, the less the color you see.
Go closer to the collection sites.
It is a great landfill, but it is even more important under water because of the dark light conditions.
Especially important if you take a picture of the camera: This device is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means that you will have to approach the collection objects if you want to fill in the frame.
The Bronze Throne of the 2012 Olympic Games after the free struggle of Bill Mahov can go into the Greek-Roman struggle.
This was reported by the chief coach of the Dagestan assembly for the free struggle of Sagid Sagid.
The specialist did not rule out the participation of sportsmen at the world championship in Tashkent in September 2014.
Bill Mahov is currently on the team of "classics", says "R-Sport" Sajida Sajidova.
In fact, as a young man, Bill spoke both ways.
At the 2005 youth world championship, he became the winner of a volleyball tournament and the third prize in the Greek-Roman contests and decided to focus on free fighting.
There has been a long conversation that the new phase of our career will be arduous in the Greek-Roman struggle.
I'll say more: Mahov can go to the world championship in Tashkent - if he wins the race.
But the key word is always for the training headquarters in the head of Gogi Koguasville.
Andrew Lawson was such a man whose personality could have been pushed around, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
The consultant anesthesiologist devoted his career to the relief of both the suffering of the disease and the pain of the treatment.
Among those who spoke to him, his wife recalled, he was an officer of MI-6, who had to live with devastating consequences of torture.
Lowson realized that while the doctor is involved with diagnosis and disease, those who are undergoing treatment mainly worry about something else.
Once in 2007, however, it proved to be to those who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel like I used to," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength.
Fighting with flu-like symptoms, he found that his wife, Juliet, was bitterly opposed.
"I want things to happen faster, not later," he said.
When Juliet left for business a week, Lauson found that he was unusually upset and unresolved.
Something's wrong.
He asked his colleague to have an X-ray of the chest.
Just two weeks earlier, he had been swimming in the skirmishes in the French Alps.
X-ray results came in.
It was a mesothelioma, untreated cancer that affects the pelvis, or a cloud of light.
For most cancers, it is difficult to identify the exact cause.
Although some smokers suffer from mild cancer, for example, not all of them suffer from mild cancer.
But with mesothelioma the other way.
In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, a volcanic building material that was once called "miracle", but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, in the end, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the recommended industrial ban entered into force.
Even when it was used, only people in specific industries worked closely with it: tubers, builders, carpenters and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxins from another era can hardly be seen as a cause for concern today.
But such calmness is wrong.
Britain seems to be at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
More people die from mesothelioma than in any other country on the planet.
In the event of an annual death of some 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from this disease as a result of car accidents.
Annual number of deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and projected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we feel its deadly effects now is that although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos have finally been banned by law in 1999), mesothelioma is usually ten years old.
And the attack of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of industrial construction.
Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, placed at home where we live, offices where we work, schools where we learn, and shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma does not focus on the class, level of supply, profession or age.
Election pools, from London’s modern universities to private schools, have proved to be no rescue.
Parliament's building is crushed by asbestos.
Even hospitals designed to treat us were the reservoirs of this deadly cancer.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber.
In fact, he had to think about where he could get into contact with the asbestos.
Then he did.
"It seems that there could have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels in the Hay hospital, where I spent six years in the internment," he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors, and truckers used these tunnels.
Interestingly, how many of my cousins get the same disease?
That was a question for which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"Among the four doctors who have been interned in the Hague hospital and who have subsequently developed mesothelioma in the last five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I remained one in the living".
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
Living so long is unusual.
Fifty per cent of mesothelioma patients die 8 months after diagnosis.
She's always mortal.
So now we can just say to Lauson, "How many of us are going to get the same disease?"
According to the leading expert on mesothelioma in Britain, Professor Julian Pito, it is likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is to survive, about 90,000 people will die.
Most do not now imagine that they will die in this way.
Absence mine in Quebec, Canada Alamy
A quick review of reports from courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the attack of mesothelioma has spread.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Jenny Ellen had been in contact with asbestos without inspection.
She worked on a network of nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading clothing departments on two sites, one of which was the main store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children over 20 years of age.
"Before this happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn't even get in my head that it would touch me.
Few people really know about asbestos.
Actually, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They have received their name from the word "asbestiform", which means a fibre structure that tells them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Christosothil, widely known as white asbestos, is more often found in buildings today.
It was used in the blood panels, the side plates, the thermoisolation of the tubes, the tails, even the brakes of the cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is nevertheless recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health damage”, which may lead to death.
More dangerous, however, is brown asbestos (amozite) and blue asbestos (crochidolite).
Britain was once the largest importer of Korean asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that “there are strong, although indirect grounds to believe that this is the main cause of a very high number of mesothelioma patients [in Britain]”.

Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that “a substantial percentage of mesotheliers, when there is no known effect on work or home, were probably caused by environmental asbestos”.
Most of this effect, he said, is due to the "normal use and impact of weather" on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The report of Goddard Consulting, which was considered by the Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even at the government's very centre, could be affected unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical shafts and pipelines behind parliamentary committees were infected with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could move as harmless as “strong air flows”.
Members of Parliament often accuse them of pursuing their own interests, but in that case it seems to be true.
Although the Parliamentary Technical Services Directorate insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a “clean health certificate”, it now recognized that work of £1 billion for the reconstruction of Parliament was needed, improving electricity and removal of asbestos, and that after the 2015 general elections, members of Parliament might be sitting at the QE2 conference centre near the Westminster Greens.
Goddard noted that “the asbestos situation was not managed in accordance with different rules”.
It is not possible to know if this error of management will be a matter of life.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who couldn't identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor of general practice.
Like Andrew Lowson, Ebbott, 50 years old, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital that had successfully been filed applications for asbestos," he said, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places he worked and the dates.
He remembers clearly, so it was the day in early December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late at night.
All of a sudden, I started to get sick.
It started very fast.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain was coming from the pelvis, the shells around the light.
But like Janice Ellen, he just didn't have reason to suspect a mesothelior.
Finally, he couldn't go to work for a month.
Predisposed doctors made X-rays of the chest and placed pleural catheters to extract liquids from the easy and send it to the analysis.
Still, his condition was not diagnosed.
He gradually improved his health and returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms came back, often after he was taking sports and breathing heavily.
In 2011, one of the patients in Abbotta came to him with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even then, Abbott did not link it to his own case.
Finally, his patient was ten years older and worked with asbestos directly.
The connection was obvious in that case.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and his doctor advised him to show the results of the CT and X-rays to the team of experts.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a sensor equipped with a camera was introduced into the space between the envelope of his chest and the envelope of his easy.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually just going further," he says.
I wasn't too worried about that, I'm telling you the truth.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy result came on a Sunday between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Gram Abbott: Diagnosed mesothelioma
Ebbott suddenly went to a meeting with Macmillan's nurses, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos thermoisolation on pipes has been quite often," he says.
People who have been affected by asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, mesothelioma is now affecting more young people in atypical profession.
The most dangerously isolated asbestos tubes in the hospitals were in the basements, so it is unlikely that patients would be affected.
But many staff who have walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lowson) or to drink in double tables (as Tom Ebbot often did) are almost likely to be affected by the toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, hospitals were a place where, theoretically, they saved lives for patients, but a place that posed a threat to the lives of doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
Schoolers installed their Bunzen burners on the asbestos floor
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and Marys because of their amazing isolation and fire performances.
Schools, too.
In fact, many were likely first exposed to the influence of asbestos in the class.
Throughout the country, for countless chemical lessons, schoolchildren set up their Bunzen burners on asbestos bases.
Web sites have appeared to focus on the issue of asbestos in schools.
In the meantime, in our homes, harmless things, such as a round plate or a sarray roof, usually contained asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison that is placed in a huge amount of our supplies," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against the Gay hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the sage of the garden sara in the 1970s.
Be careful, therefore, about gardening.
The effect of the diagnosis when it's known that the disease is incurable is huge.
"To realize that, it's going to take a long time," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I had to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I don't see Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the medical situation to the patient.
As an inestimable number of patients before him, he will remember how much information had to be accepted.
"It was hard to understand everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
They gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see Christmas anymore.
That's it."
Mesotheloma is particularly dangerous, because it's the mechanic of how we support life, the only act of breathing, that causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
The asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When the asbestos is destroyed and the fibers are inhaled, they can be stuck in a pelvis, a shell of light.
The asbestos fibers irritate the pelvis and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem is due to the inhalation of ionized asbestos fibers,” Professor Tom Treger, a heart surgeon who arrived in the hospital in 2001.
This is the hospital, where Andrew Lowson, as suspected, was exposed to asbestos, now, by the irony of fate, the leading mesothelioma treatment center.
The tender knew Lauson and treated some others who were likely affected by being infirm.
When the asbestos needles fall into the tissues of the light ones, the Treger says, "breaths them into the periphery where the shell is located.
It's, in fact, an invasive process from the very beginning.
The usual treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, causes heated disputes.
Some people think it's worth a try.
The dealer disagrees.
"It's impossible to cut the pelvis," he says.
It's impossible to take a knife around her.
In the meantime, this cancer "is not very well treated", which "acts" but does not cure.
"There have been sick people who have lived for a long time," says Treger.
But in the end, they're all dying.
Fortunately, some patients live a lot, much longer than they expect.
Author Steven J. Gold died 20 years after a diagnosis was introduced.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he had been diagnosed with mesothelioma, Ebbotta was introduced to Andrew Lowson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became a single office of support and consultation for the same patients.
"Hello, Central Cancer," he was very happy when they called.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
At first, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and prolong his life for a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lowson, however, "has dared to give everyone a slightly more positive look."
After meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loika Lang-Lazduński, professor of chest surgery in the Hague hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need directions, I just called them, and they took me," says Graham.
The medium-sized patient would have to be directed and approved for funding.
Money plays a crucial role in patients with mesothelioma to get better treatment.
However, when such treatment is ultimately ineffective, many sufferers face yet another financial cause for concern about the future of the families they leave behind.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of the Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It was known that asbestos has been harmful to health since 1898," Morgan says.
But what's changed in the 1960s, so it became clear that even very small numbers could be at risk.
That's when they talked about the company's incompetence.
Andrew Lawson and Gay Hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a "full-value settlement", according to Morgan, as Lauson could not clearly prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with the asbestos in Gay Hospital.
After the investigation of his death, the representative of the Hague hospital confirmed, however, that “absorbing in the basements mentioned were removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lauson.
How to Remove asbestos
In fact, to connect the death to asbestos to one company or to the place of work, usually ten years later, has become a major problem for patients with mesothelioma requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed owner or closed down.
The horror archives could have been lost.
And those who are protected from the allegations know that there is no time for the complainants.
In response this year, serious new legislation has emerged, which facilitates the mesothelial recovery of compensation, even if their former employers cannot be tracked.
Under that law, a £350 million fund was established financed by the insurance industry for those diagnosed after July 2012 and who could prove contact but who were not to be tried.
In such cases, the sick will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could judge in the ordinary case of compensation, approximately £120000.
Approximately 300 successful claims under the scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that £350 million is “a lot of good work” for the insurance industry.
“This transaction, written by insurers for insurers,” he said, expecting the amount to be four, that insurers would have to pay if there were no interference between the temporary interval and the mesothelioma patients could track the company and claim the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law is "infinite".
However, both Penning and Morgan recognize that a rapid response was needed when seven people die every day.
"People are suffering so much, and they need help today," Penning said at Bill's second reading about mesothelioma last December.
By then, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loika Lang-Lazduski for 19 months.
Following the initial consultations, Lang-Lazdanski recommended surgical intervention, which he considered to be effective, unlike Tom Treger.
This followed radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Lang-Lazdunski can be praised by 40 per cent of the survivors of the five-year period.
Abbott felt a sense of power.
"This, of course, is one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see that in patients all the time.
There's some kind of force that supports you.
When you give up, things can get worse very quickly.
Grem Abbott is in operation in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
The following scans did not show any signs of disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There was a few fifths in my chest.
I just had to be 50.
It's not a life threat.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no sign of a storm.
However, the process was both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things -- finance when I die, for example, or what a woman needs to show how a timer works on a bowler.
When you get bad news, you become unhappy.
We need to look forward.
Like Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Tamsin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to understand what to say and how to say a lot.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that means I'm not going to be old.
They responded very differently.
Themzin is very general and energetic.
She told all her friends, and they called us very quickly.
Ellie was more detained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something to be faced with with all the painful cancers.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even by a troubled opportunity to survive.
This disease carries with it a dark certainty (although ultimately for Steven Jay Gulda).
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesoteliomas is not a threat to life.
The bodies of the embalmed Pharaohs are cast into asbestos cloths.
The asbestos fibers are used to strengthen the castrel and increase the temperature.
It's the old one that describes asbestos.
Now there's a canvas that's not burning.
I've seen the soaps made out of it, rolling in the fireplaces on the benches.
Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used for the manufacture of paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Major asbestos mines are opened in Canada and South Africa and soon thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
It's the perfect heater for steam engines and the turbine of the Industrial Revolution.
The world's production of asbestos is increasing by more than 30,000 tons a year.
Prudential statistics indicate premature mortality among those who work with asbestos and thus are denied life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw is dying in Rochedale.
Dr. William Cook points out that the particles of asbestos in its light “were, without any doubt, the main cause of death.”
It's the first case of this kind.
The employees of Kershaw, Turner Bros Asbestos, do not accept responsibility.
No compensation is paid.
During World War II, there has been an intensive development of shipping, one of the most deadlyly dangerous professions in terms of contact with asbestos.
Voluntary industrial ban on imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for health damage caused by asbestos contact in the United Kingdom.
The world's production of asbestos is increasing to over 4213000 tons a year.
UK imports 139000 tonnes.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Security in the United Kingdom requires that all asbestos contractors be licensed.
Imports and use of blue and brown asbestos are prohibited by law in the United Kingdom.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in Britain.
An act on mesothelioma was adopted in Britain.
The compensation scheme of £350 million was announced.
asbestos is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production is about 2 million tonnes per year.
China refuses to grant Hong Kong the right to elect leaders; protesters will take revenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to apply for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move would probably lead to long-standing protests in the Hong Kong business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within a few hours after that statement.
The decision of the All-China People ' s Assembly, in fact, allows Communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It has not deceived our expectations, but it still angers," said legislator Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
It's not what Beijing promised.
They lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And obviously we're dealing with the authoritarian regime.
In defending China's decision, Lee Fay, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the All-China People's Assembly, said that allowing the international movement to lead Hong Kong would be too chaotic.
Since 1997, when Britain had transferred control over Hong Kong back to China, Beijing had promised to allow the inhabitants of the region to elect by vote the head of the Government, starting in 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision taken on Sunday as a democratic step forward, as it gave the Hong Kongers the right to a direct vote; however, the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of the commission to move candidates closely controlled from Beijing.
And according to the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision was taken after the summer, when one of the largest and most widely heard protests in Hong Kong took place over many years.
Much of the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is supported by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to cover the financial area of Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee this universal electoral right.
On Sunday evening, a few hours after the statement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central met in the rain in front of the headquarters of the Hong Kong Government.
At the demonstrations, the organizers stated that their movement was moving into a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise to protests in the weeks to come.
However, they have not reported details, evidently trying to avoid problems with public authorities.
In the online statement, the organizers reported that the movement “considered the possibility of occupying the central area only as an exclusive measure, which can only be taken if all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We regret very much that, to date, all the possibilities of dialogue will be exhausted and the central area will undoubtedly be occupied.
The government authorities in Hong Kong were preparing for Beijing's statement several days, and security measures were strengthened in the headquarters of the Government on Sunday, involving the police and barricades.
Many people in Hong Kong feel that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The flow of the population from the mother increases competition in the field of goods and services.
It is also growing in fear that Hong Kong values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticise the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations are at risk of business - a source of living force in Hong Kong.
"But what they are talking about is that it can cause a lot of economic damage, depending on how many people will be involved for a long time," said Regina Ip, who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We do not want any concern over Hong Kong getting out of control.
This is a presentation that is harmful to investment.
Chinese public media have also reported in recent days, in which Hong Kong activists of the democratic movement have been shown to be divergent by the Western Powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law that attracted 780,000 participants, more than one fifth of Hong Kong ' s voters.
In July, tens of thousands went to one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The U.S. culture of graduations comes to university life: the first runners were invited to arrive on a personal plane
We are pleased to respond to this request by launching the first luxury travel service in Britain for the current students.
In order to leave a clear impression of coming to university, the company also offers transportation options such as a personal plane, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stuart also said that the service was thinking about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to take their stuff across the country into a dangerous overloaded car.
In conjunction with our new options for the VIF, we look forward to helping students this year to get to university with minimum effort and maximum luxury.
The representative of the company reported that, since the service had just started, no orders had yet been made, but added that “students will begin to order this service within the next few weeks”.
The company also stated that despite the need for students to pay for the training of £9000 per year, it hoped to find a market for this service.
Students today are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hope: it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and the VIF is what it needs.
However, the National Union of Students criticized this service as being deprived of reality.
Megan Dann, vice-president of the NSC for higher education, said: “This project seems to be incredibly out of touch with the lives of most students.
Many students who will start college this month face a life-value crisis when available financial support in the form of loans and grants does not succeed in the rapidly increasing costs of basic needs before they can even begin to think of spending thousands of pounds on some kind of simple income in the community.
Feminists raise the issue of racial belonging and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come raise their hands, screaming, "Hands up, don't shoot" while they're waiting in front of the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, related to the murder of the unarmed adolescent Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed an Internet conversation among white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminists who left comments put the gender above racial ownership when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions in the Middle West increased and national attention was drawn, Pérez saw the responses of white women who concentrated 100 per cent on racial membership.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the murder of 9 August, personal essays with headlines such as "the thoughts of Ferguson from the white woman" and "Feminism is not only about the oppression of women" appeared quite late.
But for Pérez, they showed a significant move.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic of the crisis we have faced, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so related to raciality, they felt that it should be pointed out.
For a professor of English at the University of Ohio Corita, Mitchell Ferguson encountered problems that black Americans face every day, but that are not perceived as women's problems in the cultural field.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner and getting 150 likes everywhere," Mitchell says.
When I write something about how colorful people are being attacked in their own country, silence is deafening.
"Why is it safe to talk to women about relations, but not about public security?" she asks.
For black women, such as Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly divide these problems; they face a difficult reality every day.
While white women are now joining racial and gender issues in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hetter, professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"From 1865 to 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and this almost always resulted in the rape of white women," Hetter said.
There was a need for a white woman to confirm the story to justify the leeching.
In Hetter's view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffrageists, such as Susan B. Anthony, examined the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for election law would be effective only for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in the basket of the right to vote for women, and the right to vote for blacks should have appeared later," Hetter said.
Looking back at such things gives us a clear picture of why color women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women had obtained voting rights in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynching in the Association of South Women for the Prevention of lynching.
The group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
In the light of Mitchell's reaction to the problems of white feminists in Ferguson, police behaviour, racial discrimination, reflects the time when white feminists had to "suffer" the problems of black women in several generations.
"Really, it would be great if activists with such [traditional] feminist ideology had the right to raise a child as they do to the right to contraception?" Mitchell asked.
The second wave feminists, who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now beginning to understand what that means.
A famous white feminist movement activist, Gloria Steinem, two weeks after Michael Brown's murder, took advantage of Facebook and published a brief article by the Guardian Rebecca Carroll columnist, who demanded that white Americans participate more in racist protests.
"I hope that women who have another but similar reason to understand the danger posed by the body - and the view of racial issues that are significantly different from those of the public - will be in the head of change," Steinem wrote.
Although Stanim is concerned about more cross-referencing feminism, which includes racial issues, and gender, her comments on race in America are still surprising by some.
A researcher at the American Business Institute Kristina Sommers, author of "Who stole feminism?" said She The People, that young men in the United States, especially colourful young people, "are much more vulnerable than their sisters", but the remarks by Stanem about Ferguson contradict the criticism she had earlier expressed.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small programme, “Watch out for my brother”, to help vulnerable black and Spanish young people, she followed an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Stein.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem that leads to a better line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested some 63,000 minors without escorting to the South-West border this year, immigration reform has again surfaced, this time as a problem for women.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to address this issue as an important issue for women, it was only necessary to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of the workers ' visas are issued to [immigrant men], women who come with them are placed in a position that is vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are a response to women's organizations," she said.
Ipswig House with Pigs for sale
The photo of the house on sale in Saffol was taken away by real estate agents when it was shown that there was a large pig lying in the guest room.
For sale for £120000, a separate house with one bedroom is on a private road in Ipswick.
A detailed description was given by a photo of the guest house, on which a pig with a head sitting on the couch was depicted.
The Connells real estate agency reported that the pig in the photo is the pet of the owner of the house.
"At the same time, the photo was mistakenly located and has already been removed," the company representative reported.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former house of the assemblies as “one single house with one bedroom”.
Although the Agency removed the photo from its website, it is still in advertising material.
The sale of the house caused interest in social networks where some asked whether pigs were sold together with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the fourth round of U.S. Open, elected Caroline Voznitzki, believes that she does not have enough stability.
According to the sportsman, she wants to finish the year and try to go to a new level, she transfers from New York to Vasiliy OSIPUOV.
How do you generally rate your performance at the "More Helmet" tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad you won the Rollan Garros.
With regard to the three other tournaments, I did not have enough stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
She couldn't even get to the fourth floor.
What are your goals until the end of the season?
After the injury, I have a huge motivation to go to a new level.
I have something to work on, and I'm going to do my best to finish the year.
The Asian tournament begins in a couple of weeks.
A member of the Committee of the Parliament on Physical Culture, Sport and Youth Affairs, former peace champion Nikolai Valuev, proposed that the GTO be awarded bonuses on the way in.
According to him, the rules will generally be the same as those of the Council, and people will be given the rules of withdrawal, escape and other exercises.
It is recalled that 12 Russian actors will begin to implement the WTO rule on 1 September.
I also offered to the schoolchildren who had given the GTO a bonus when they came in, - Valuev noted.
For example, they may be able to add some balls to the EEG.
There are also proposals to provide additional output workers to enterprises that have passed the sporting tests.
In Harvey, South Wales, a new millionaire appeared after winning the lottery
A lottery game from Harvey this month.
A new millionaire is being searched south-west from Perth, where one lucky man takes home nearly $1.1 million with a lottery play on Saturday night.
The newspaper kiosk in Harvi brings gold to the main prize for the second time in five years, the last win was $1 million in November 2009.
A successful winner, however, still needs to make a statement.
The mistress of Steve Forvard said that the winner caused the victory in a small town south-west of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and it's all very excited.
We thought such a win could be a secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the win of the main prize last month, noting the completion of several successful weeks for the state players.
Last week, a game from Kenning Weil became one of the five million in August, followed by a huge $7.5 million winning couple from Belmont just a few weeks before that.
The winning couple has been playing for 20 years and has reported that the winner has given them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new home.
A millionaire from Harvey brings the number of winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total of $85 million.
Mineconomy wants to accelerate the growth of the mobile market
This week, Minéconomy will introduce to the Government a comprehensive plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, the director of the department of the Ministry of Agriculture, Oleg Pluznikov, on a round table held by the "Administration" at the Moscow Auto salon, 2014.
The plan is made up of a Government mandate, one of the main objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September, beginning in October, says the Plüzniks, the proposed measures relate to electric cars and hybrids, a plan for the development of vehicles on gas fuel in Russia already exists.
The plan (a copy is available in the "Beautifuls") for 2014-2017.
Criteria for the assessment of electrical and hybrid transport are to be developed and to decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally sound vehicles.
The Government's report, which will describe tax and customs measures to support electricity transport, will be prepared by December 2014; the preferential credit and leasing scheme will appear by April 2015; and proposals for lowering the price of cars, encouraging localization and creating service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is planned to amend legislation to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (in parks, parking stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to make proposals for regional authorities during 2015 to also encourage the use of clean transport - in the form of benefits for traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals to increase the purchases of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, Montenegro will list the indicators for assessing the activities of the regional authorities, which reflect the effectiveness of support for the production of clean transport, the development of charging infrastructure.
The market for electric cars in Russia has not yet been established - around 100 electric cars have been sold throughout the country in 2013.
In early 2014, the reduced import duty on electric cars was estimated to be about 500 items, and the main executive director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrei Pankov, predicted.
However, the five-fold growth does not make the electric cars quite noticeable: 2.78 million light and light commercial cars were sold in 2013 in Russia, according to the European Business Association.
While in Russia only Mitsubishi Motors is imported.
The introduction of the import is being prepared by Renault, a company focused primarily on corporate clients, says the Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships of Renault in Russia, Nikola Remiz.
Most other electricity producers, however, took a waiting position with regard to Russia.
The development of electric cars is also the case for Russian producers - "GAZa, " but the release is poor.
For example, in January - July 2014, ASM Holdinga, AutoWAZ issued 30 electric cars.
The request for a low price for expensive electric cars is recognized by the director of AutoWAZa for Sergei Amanov's engineering, without a break in this segment....
The development of the Russian electric car market, in addition to expensive cars (the electric cars sold in Russia, on average, two-way analogous to internal combustion engines) hinders the indevelopment of charging infrastructure (the unit), is inspired by the Director of Autostate Sergei Celicov.
Due to the expensive and low rates of low cost reductions in the next 3-4 years, the Russian market will remain a niche segment, predicted by the editor-in-chief of "Authoriu" Michael Travelianski, Celicov agreed with him.
Autoproducers, on the contrary, say that some models of electric cars are already close to the value of conventionals.
The Russian market has good prospects for electric cars, mainly to build consumer confidence that "electricity" is real; this will, in particular, contribute to the emergence of all new charging stations, emphasizes the president of the BMW group in Russia, Wolfgang Slimme.
Such infrastructure projects are implemented, for example, by the Roscetti Gossetti: several stations have been built in Moscow, and about 80 more will soon appear.
Negotiations on the construction of the pipeline network are also under way with other regions.
According to the director of the Rosstej Department, Vladimir Sofiina, the company believes in the market for electric cars and is ready to build supplies throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric cars in the country and a lack of a single standard for charging different brands.
In addition, Rossetti as a network company does not have the right to sell electricity, it is designed to do so with regard to the charging of electric cars.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of the establishment in Russia of a charging of customs duties on electric motor vehicles.
The zero rate will be effective by the end of 2014, the possibility of extending it, expanding the list.
The replacement of the transport tax on the environment (the idea is discussed and all cars) also supports the market, but it is not as sensitive as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
Transport tax in Russia is low, says Pankov, unlike Norway, where tax cuts have led to a sharp increase in the sale of electric cars, which now accounts for 12 per cent of the market.
Russia also needs incentives for car owners, such as free parking in the city centre (as already done in Moscow), which is assured by Pankov, or the possibility of moving electric cars by designated zones, which are not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado
The single-engine Piper PA-46 crashed in Colorado, U.S.A.
Three of the five people who were killed in it are transferred to ITAR-TASS.
The survivors were delivered to the hospital.
The accident occurred several kilometres from the airport of Denver.
The causes of the tragedy are now being established.
In the Danube area, they deal with prisoners of the Donbass Battalion.
The riders were surrounded by the Additive.
They were handed over by their own commanders, and dozens of gunmen were shot.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation in the south-east of Ukraine really was, they wouldn't go to war.
108 prisoners can be called happy.
Carats from the Donbass battalion remained alive after the "messorbuk" in which they fell under the Addisive.
In the area of the army of the People's Republic of Donetsk, the fighters spent several days actually spent by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When it was reported from the headquarters that the wheel could be pulled out of the hall, the column moved.
But literally a few minutes from all sides, they hung their shells and bullets.
"Because of the information we were given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave," says the Deputy Battalion Commander, who has the so-called "Lermont."
And when we got down to the bottom between the multiple and the redhead, there was a cross-fire from the antitank-controlled missiles, from the "shunk" grenades, 30 millimeters, BMD automatic rifles, small weapons.
Four cars went in front of me and behind three, and in the end only two cars left.
An officer called Leermont tells us that at least 60 people were killed, tens were wounded, many died then.
The survivors are now providing medical assistance to those they came to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that so-called "terrorists" are being treated with them, giving food, medicines.
At the same time, their own commanders actually lied to them and caused them to die.
They just betrayed us, they say.
A column, the whole battalion, to destroy it.
In the Donbass battalion, like many of his companions, Alexei was a volunteer, because in Ukrainian news, they told about the atrocities that were reportedly committed in the south-east of the separatists.
Alexei has already seen a completely different picture.
His mother in Lugansk was killed, not by anyone, but by Ukrainian soldiers.
My friend called me, told me that there was a mini-mimetic attack, which is probably the Ukrainian armed forces, one of the soldiers, Alexei.
After that, I wanted to get out of the battalion.
We weren't released from Addisco, they said we were in the ring.
I've already agreed with the commander, and I've already written a report on care.
We were immediately taken to Addis Ababa by Zuracho Congregations.
According to the detainees, a total of 300-350 people were trapped in the cathouse under the U.S.
Some of the survivors now admit that if time could be returned, they would not enter the punishment battalion for anything.
All the detainees have been transferred to DNA forces.
Everyone will be checked for military crimes.
In the region, a product price limitation headquarters is established
In the Red Sea, a headquarters will be established which, if necessary, will limit the price increase of products on the market in the region.
The order for the establishment of this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters was composed of members of the country ' s Government, executive officials and supervisors.
Together, they will monitor the prices of agricultural production in the country.
Economics News -- Will Kiev "Rosnefti" cost $140 million?
Rosnefti, Igorj Sechin, said that the company estimated the damage from the Lisican NPZ shooting in Ukraine at $140 million.
That's what he reported in the Spiegel interview.
"We appreciate the damage of $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian Government on compensation," Sechin said.
According to him, the implementation of the modernized company of Lisian NPH was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There were no fighting, there were no "resurrectionists," but the Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial site.
Moreover, the technology oil that's stuck in the tube is missing," he said.

The plant is able to emit the Euro-4 fuel, as well as the Euro-5 fuel batch.
In March 2012, the supply of oil to the Lisican NPZ was suspended due to its loss.
The company decided to start repair.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisian NWN together with other Ukrainian TNC-WR assets.
The DPRK has launched a small-scale project towards the Japanese Sea.
South Korean media reported that this occurred about 10:30 a.m. on the local side of the province of Chagando, which is on the border of North Korea and China.
As Interfax reported in the Joint Committee of South Korean Chiefs of Staff, it was suspected that the missile fell to the Japanese Sea after it had flown about 220 kilometers.
The rubble falls in the background of geopolitical pressure
In the Moscow Stock Exchange, the dollar grew to 3 copies to 37.15 rubles, and the rubble went down to the biovoltaic basket in front of geopolitical tension.
The exchange rate for the dollar for the ETS started with transactions in the borders of 37,11-37,2 rub.1, an average of two minutes of the course recorded at the level of 37,16 rub/$1, which is 4 copies above the previous closure level.

The Russian market continued to decline rapidly on Friday, 29 August, but there was no panic this time.
He continued to make money and rubble and even updated the historical maxim to the dollar.
Now investors are already playing aggravating geopolitical conditions and possible new sanctions to Russia.
However, it is more like an artificial estuary that is spread through the media, especially the Western ones.
The options for introducing new sanctions to the RF are not so much.
TeleTrade “At the opening of the Moscow Stock Exchange, the ruble continues to be severely weakened against the biovoltaic corset.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, both the Russian indices and the positions of the national currency can be adjusted.
"Orenburg Airlines" will be tried with "Ideal Tour"
"Orenburg Airlines" have submitted an "ideal-tour" claim of 4.7 billion rubles.
It is two cases that will take place in October.
There will be different judges to consider.
As Interfax reports, the first claim was filed on 14 August.

The second statement was made on 18 August.
His sum is 4.24 billion rubles.
The meeting was scheduled for 2 October.

The manager of the Aeroflot, Vitaly Savelev, calls it even more than two billion rubles.
Twitter has tried to become more interesting for new users
The Microblog Twitter service has changed the user registration process to faster involve new participants in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have lost their microbials.
Now, new Twitter users will watch a large number of recommended accounts during registration to immediately form their reading circle.
The recommendations are based on those identified in the registration of interests.
However, Twitter automatically installs a signature branch for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to manually take pictures of the loops so that he doesn't read those that he doesn't care about.
If the microblog users have seen only the avatars of the recommended users, Twitter will now turn out a sample of one of the popular tweets of the blogger to help make an impression on the person.
This has been the biggest change in Twitter's foreign registration in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter has been active in modernizing the service.
This activity is primarily linked to the continuing efforts of the service to achieve safety.
In 2014, the microblog service experienced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a fall in reader activity.
The company now desperately needs more reliable consumer resources, which would remain for a long time.
Only in this way can there be a stable flow of advertising.
The Day of Knowledge in Moscow will be a day of light and of rain.
The first September in the Moscow region will be cold and rainy throughout the day, meteorologists report.
The air temperature in Moscow ranges from 16 to 18 degrees, in Podmoskovje - 13-18 degrees.
When the weather is clear, the weather will drop, and the wind in the eastern quarter will be quite weak, only 3-8 meters per second.
Vehicle utilization programme resumed from 1 September
Since 1 September, a car-utilization programme has been renewed in Russia.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for this purpose.
As the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade explained, the funds are allocated from the limits that have already been transferred to the Ministry of Industry and Trade by redeployment from other areas of support.
The programme covers all cars over six years of age.
The amount of compensation will amount to between 40,000 for the light car and 350 thousand rubles for the goods.
In Russia, such a vehicle-utilization programme had already been in place.
The main difference in the current project, the Minister explained, is that not only is the use of machines to obtain a subsequent discount, but also the possibility, if the car is over six years old, of acquiring a new discount with the old one in the "trade-in" to the dealer, is passed on to the "Interfax".
More than 16 billion rubles have been lost in the previous federal waste disposal programme, from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of production of light cars in 2010 was about 1.2 million (plus 101.4 per cent compared to 2009).
Creator Coming Out Simulator will issue a game of contemporary journalism
Gamemaker Nikki Case, known as the Coming Out Simulator, decided to release the game about modern journalism.
He told me about his project in the Kill Screen interview.
Case started to work on the game a few weeks ago, but the fact has been widely known only now.
The source of the inspiration for the game has become the events in Ferguson, where protests are now taking place after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which has not yet been named, will be how information on history affects its impact.
The hero of the game, a civil journalist, will need to photograph those in areas where police and population clashes occur.
Hero could take a different picture of what's going on, which affects the movement of events.
If he shoots the scene so that the police will look like heroes and the protesting gangs, the police will be better off treating him and letting him go where he can't go.
If he's going to highlight events differently, his photographs can turn peaceful protests into a large rebellion.
The eyes of the game will have to be picked up by a twitter showing new signatories if the photos posted there are popular.
The game doesn't have names yet.
The dates of exit and the platforms on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how the event could change depending on how the photograph was made and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen Case, he explained that he had been considering the concept of such a game for a long time, but originally wanted to dedicate it to not protests in the United States but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he began to collect game material, the game designer realized that he did not have enough knowledge and skills to highlight the history of the region.
However, when he saw the news of the events in Ferguson, he decided to play the game on the grounds of what had happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who issues browser games.
Its most famous project was the Coming Out Simulator, which emerged in 2014.
This game, which relates to the events of Casey’s own biography, is about how a bisexual teenager tries to tell his or her homophobic parents.
Geletius involves Ukraine in the continuation of the bloodshed
The call to prepare for the ordinary " tens of thousands " victims of the defence minister of Ukraine, Valerie Galetei, has attracted the people to the continuation of the bloodshed, according to the MID RF.
“In Moscow, of course, attention has been drawn to the statements made by the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valerie Geleta, who stated that “the completion of an operation to free the East of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of “The Great National War”, which will cost “tens of thousands”.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the Ukrainian military department, published on its Facebook page, is the subject of a study of non-military specialists," said the Russian diplomats.
They are eager to believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On its page in Facebook, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “For informal channels, the Russian side has already threatened that if the resistance continues, they will be prepared to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
He also stated that the "operation on the liberation of the East of Ukraine" had been completed.
Perez Hilton removed all the intimate photos of the stars and apologized
Today’s horror has taken over 60 Hollywood stars.
The hackers broke primitive passwords in iCloud (data storage) in smartphones, and their intimate photos appeared on the site of the blogger Perez Hilton.
True, not long ago.
Remember, the official star star Jennifer Lawrence has already reported stealing photos from her cell phone, and confirmed that all the photos that "shadow" in the Network are true.
Through Hilton, the creator of a single tabloid site, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues for publishing their photos, says The Independent.
No, no one made me do that.
I wasn't contacted by their agents.
And now I'm going to take a photo of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice," he wrote a blogger on Twitter.
However, all the photos revealed have already flown through the Network.

Tony Stuart is suffering an accident back on track.
Tony Stuart's return to the track ended a little more than in the middle of the race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stuart broke into the wall the second time after his right front tyre broke down in 172 circles, ending his speech.
Stuart took his car to the garage and then left without talking to the reporters.
His team leader Chad Johnston said that 14 members of the team were upset, but now they will focus on the race in the next march in Richmond, Virginia.
"I would like it to be a more successful attempt and a more successful finish for him," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond and hopefully we'll get better.
Stuart first crashed into the wall earlier in the race the night after he met Kyle Bush, which required repair on the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty good hope to come to the finish," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work."
Soon after the second accident, Stuart's car was loaded on the evacuation, and the team was gathered and ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver during the ground race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week, and he had to win either in Atlanta or in the next race in Richmond to participate in the Persecution.
He returned to work during the investigation of a tragic incident, which resulted in the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Younger, who was on his way to express his discontent with Stuart during the race.
The law enforcement authorities announced on Friday that the cause of the accident would continue for at least two more weeks.
The decision to file an indictment was not taken by Stuart.

Then at 122 rounds after Busha's restaurant.
The 18 went off the tractor on the way out of the turn 2 and broke into Stuart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stuart continued, but stayed until 21st position.
Sobach and Vitorgan are having cigarettes with Zvánecki in Odessa.
Xenia Sobac and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, which the TV conductor has not missed to report to his Instagram.
True, one photograph was very surprising, and the couple’s worshipers were very upset.
A photo taken in Zvanecko.
"On the morning at Mikhail Mikhailjč Zvanecko Maxim explains what the instagram is:)) #Odessa," she signed a photo of Xenia Sobac.
However, there is nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, no steak, no butter, no other...
The worshipers of the couple decided that Xusha was smoking too, and they condemned her for it.
"And cigarettes whose?" "Course kills!" "Sometimes it's a cigarette morning," "I'd like to have breakfast, but only cigarettes on the table")) """ "Kenya, you're smoking too?" -- they were excited about their favorite signator of her blog.
Remember, Concca recently boasted about how much delicious food she had prepared for the first time in her life, Maxim Vitorgan.
"Happy is that when you come to the table, and your husband has prepared a meal for you (first for your wife's life, because he's delicious."The main thing is that now at the end of the meal, he didn't say in the anecdotes, "That's how it was every day," she praised her husband Xenia Sobach.
The picture shows that Maxim's making something crazy, and there's already a sun and a hot chicken on the table.
Bulgarian prison officials conducted national protests
Hundreds of prisoners from all over Bulgaria conducted a national protest against the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands to restore the old working conditions, which had recently been changed.
Increased salaries are also included in the list of requirements to be discussed with the temporary Acting Minister of Justice Christo Ivanov.
During the month, the officers protested against a new schedule of work, requiring the previous 24-hour shifts.
Although the trade union of prison officials met repeatedly with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, the agreement had not been reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reported.
Negotiations are continuing, the Head of the Chief Executive of the Administration of Sentences of Rosen Geljakov reported.
The members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join in the protest of the union of prisoners.
The army controls the new Government of Thailand
General Praut (right) appointed Minister of Defence of the Right of Wongsuvan (left)
The military governor and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Praut Chan-Ocha, announced a new cabinet of ministers of the country, in which more than one third of the posts were held by generals or generals in resignation.
The military had received key positions: the Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praut Chan-Ocha was approved as Prime Minister following the official approval by the King of Thailand of the appointment of the head of the temporary military Government.
The 60-year-old military who took power in the country on 22 May was the only candidate for the premiere.
He was elected Prime Minister at the parliamentary meeting.
The army had previously appointed MPs of Parliament.
According to Prauta Chan-Och, the revolution was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by the continuing half-years of demonstration, during which protesters demanded resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat.
Officially Praut Chan-Och will be a temporary prime minister, as the military plans to hold a general election at the end of 2015.
There are, however, fears that military forces are trying to strengthen their power in the country.
Soldiers came to power on 22 May
in the background of the full paralysis of the civilian authority.
The leaders of the main political parties were arrested temporarily.
Immediately after the arrival of the military, they were arrested by the country ' s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yingluk Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis is rooted in 2006, when the army moved from the post of Prime Minister Yingluk Chinawat Taksin.
Both of them enjoy the popularity of the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has often made them successful in the elections.
However, many representatives of the middle class and the capital elite have entered the anti-government movement, which has practically paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one said that the media room would be better, I didn't promise you that, an officer from the new Palm browser was learning.
It has to be formally recognized that this is indeed the case, but the mind and stomach remain unabated.
Because they've always known that we're saying "Belgium" -- meaning media -- we're saying "media" -- meaning "Belgium."
Restaurants like to state in depth that the success of the institution depends on three factors: location, location and again location.
There's places like this that aren't for good, but even great, but something bad.
In a short time, sitting behind Palm's chair, I remembered that there was once a coffee "Bordok" (in honor of the same TV player), then "Odesa-mama", and another restaurant "Bojole" and "Friend".
Now it's beer again, but it's not nostalgic-Soviet, it's Belgian.
There was only a peak of iceberg: a bar stand and a pair of chairs, and the rest of the space was not even covered with sunlight.
That's why it's fun here, like in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows, TVs, where the Russian girls swim.
The Belgian institutions in Petersburg have long been out of the news, so to compare there is something.
Here are eight types of brewing (260-300 rubles per 0.5 litre) and a countless number of bottlenecks (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive officer is happy to present the menu, saying that “media is a solid large seed”, and it should be noted that service, despite some shortcomings, is the most positive side of Palm.
I am expected to be content, but often very unexpected to be done.
For example, it is suggested that a meat roulette with a walnut black (280 rubles) is actually a carpach, cut to the same length, so that the parchment paper is so thick as to be rendered.
It's possible to feel a taste, if you make a mistake together.
It's worse with salads.
The classic liege (260) would be best recognized as a crime against the Belgian people: some yellow iceberg, once opened a long time ago, a dried Kenyan beans, debossed beak chips, plus a seam hole.
You don't want to meet anyone like that!
The composition of the Belgian salad ingredients was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If you could still close your eyes on the unadulterated quarters of the pastry tomatoes or overheated champs, why would the media look as if they had been able to freeze and open them several times for their lives!
I already know that there are perfectly normal Belarusian media here!
They're placed in the bowls "in sauce for your choice" (490-560 rubles per 0.5 kg).
The sousus of a half-life, which is of white wine, celery and carrots, has not been explicitly mentioned.
There are fruits, and there is no aroma, whether or not there was wine, or whether it remained a mystery.
That's why it's good for the free-to-home media to have a home mayonnaise.
The chicken water in here is not a dish, so thick that depending on the mood you can decide, the first or second dish before you, and just a nice sleek sauce.
It was said that the rabbit was prepared in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosmarin.
On the other hand, the situation was dimensionally counterproductive: the rosemary had silenced everything.
It was suggested that this rabbit was fed with only rosemary lumps, from which meat had acquired such an unusual aroma.
But when the rabbit was attached to the knife, it was a remarkable one, no, it was simply an oblivion in a caramelized leg.
Waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also sweet, with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The clan sauce turned out to be too much hydrogenist, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager sitting at the table was very informally interested in the afternoon impressions.
So it's time to come again.
The dollar exchange rate rose to over 37 rubles on news of new sanctions against Russia in the West.
It's a new historical record.
The dollar was calculated "to-morrow" at 10:29 a.m. growth of 26.9 copies and was 37.02 roubles, the euro course rose to 30 roubles - up to 48.73 roubles, the data of the Moscow Stock Exchange.
The original corset grew by 28 copies to the previous closure level and stood at 42.28 rubles.
The dollar reached its peak on 19 February 2009, when it stood at 36.43 rubles and on 3 March 2014, it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that the President of the United States, Barack Obama, and Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, were discussing the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakness of the arm is long-term, in pairs with the euro, and in pairs with the dollar.
The long-term forecast meant this note, says the senior analyst, "Alpari" Anna Bodrov.
Everything related to Ukraine will be reflected in courses anyway.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today's hearings about the invasion of armies have not been confirmed on either side, but the market has become very emotional.
All the talks that he had held on to such news were overcast yesterday.
It is estimated that around 36,90 and 37,05 rubles per dollar will be closed each week.
The tax period has ended, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine is all a single loop.
The inflation gap is also projected: current autumn prices will be increased from 5 to 10 per cent.
In the near future, seasonal fruits and vegetables will end, and some vacuum will occur as long as the networks are redirected to other suppliers.
"The dollar came to the mark in 37 rubles, passed it and returned, no powerful exodus," commented the head of the market analysis department "Open Broker" Constantine Bushev.
They will still see if they will introduce the promised sanctions on Saturday as NATO will meet.
Rubl, he said, was severely weakened after the end of the tax season, followed by news about Ukraine, and the CB said last week that it was moving completely to a floating course by the end of the year and refused any currency interventions.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, it was nothing different from the previous month, and everyone was afraid of the 37 rubles, the analyst continued.
Yes, nothing powerful has happened in the process.
The alarming times for the currency market were recalled when an increased demand for the currency was observed at the end of January, as well as the third March when the CB downloaded the record of the currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the weakening of the rub.
First of all, it is an increase in the income part of the budget from export operations, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers through the travel of imports, says UFS chief analyst IC Alexei Kozlov.
The travel of imported goods and services can be traced back to a negative point.
The sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency have significantly reduced the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, caused inflationary pressure to rise and, as a result, have become the cause of money-laundering, which, in turn, would slow the country ' s economy.
As far as the stock market is concerned, the undercutting of the rubles is somewhat consistent with the decrease in the price of the shares expressed in the rubles.
For example, the IMIB index in Thursday's trade decreased by 1.67 per cent and the RTS index lost 3.27 per cent.
Such a significant difference in the relative rate of index decline is due to a decrease of more than 1.5 per cent during the day.
The weakness of the rub is emotional and is due to a massive desire to buy the currency.
As the practice shows, the emotions are gradually gone, and the scoreboards are partially or completely restored to lost positions.
"We think we will soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency close to 36 rubles per dollar," notes Alexei Koslov.
Genetic violation is often misdiagnosed
The British reported that she had spent many years thinking that she would die after misdiagnosed.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she had been living for a few years after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had a scar-Mari Tut's disease (SMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that caused nerve damage outside her brain and spinal cord.
The charity of CMT UK reported that a misdiagnosis was a common problem among people with CMT because it was so little known about this condition.
Some 23,000 people in Britain are suspected to have SMT, which may cause motor symptoms, such as muscle weakness, untrustworthy walking, and nailed legs.
The patient may experience an inflammation or pain, and the condition is not healed and progresses, which means that the symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from the fall of Friedrich (AF) - a condition for which she was very poor.
Rogers thought she'd be attached to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and she'd die before she was 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said, "With Rebecca, I knew I couldn't do what others did.
I fell down every day, and I spent more time.
I've never been able to play roles or skateboards with other kids, and I've had a lot of fun at school because of how I walked and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several operations, to free an olive grove and to direct her feet, she looked into the medical card when her doctor left the room, and it was written that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I dropped my nose where it was wrong, and so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this situation in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and tried the most terrible panic as soon as possible.
I thought I was going to be in a wheelchair in 18 and die before I was 25, and that I was gradually losing all my abilities in the meantime.
I went through it alone, and I planned my own funerals.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up, hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you've got this disease because you're already in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that represents a much smaller threat to life.
After several genetic studies, she found SMT.
"When he explained that it was a SMT, I thought I had a happy ticket," she said.
The blessed organization of SMT announced a month of information on SMT to try to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on business in the Washington area is rising as the economy recovers
The recovery economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
State and local tax accounts for companies across the country increased moderately last year when economic recovery was accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington area were no exception.
The companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia paid $27.6 billion in the state and at the local level in the financial year 2013, at 3.8 per cent higher than the $22.6 billion collected for 2012.
The tax burden on businesses by state and local level increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent earlier, and this was the third half year of growth after the next year, when accounts fell, in 2009 and 2010.
The taxes collected by the state increased faster than the local taxes by 4.3 per cent, according to the study conducted by the company providing professional services, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Centre, the Tax Policy Group.
More than half of the tax revenues in the district, 56 per cent, are taxable on entrepreneurs, while 36 per cent of Maryland's tax revenues are taxable on firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, has the lowest tax income, proportionally from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, tax revenues have returned to the value of the company's real estate, researchers say, which increased real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years when the growth was less than 1 per cent.
While the bulk of these revenues are large states, such as California, New York and Texas, it seems the same is happening in the Washington area.
The companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia paid together $10 billion in real estate taxes at the state and local level last year, at $9.6 billion more than in 2012, an increase of 4.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate has no similar effect on the increase in government and local income in Maryland, where real estate taxes are barely more than one fifth of the company ' s tax accounts.
Virginia and the District of Colombia pay about half of the state and local tax accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
"What is happening in Maryland is that most of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Colombia, belongs either to the Government or to non-commercial organizations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the State Tax Centre.
Thus, Maryland has much more to rely on, for example, income taxes to pay the same services that are in other states.
The recent growth in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
Entrepreneur's income also appears to be changing, according to this data.
Companies in the region have declared a corporate income tax at the state level of $2.3 billion, worth $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion of corporate income from income tax, mostly in the region.
While trends are in one direction, the tax burden on entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three locations.
The growth rate in the District of Colombia was at the same level as the average country, 4.3 per cent, while the growth rate in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, the tax income was below the average, which was 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia, the lowest corporate income tax from three jurisdictions (each of which was the same corporate rate) was 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the district it is relatively high, 9.975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia, the taxes below are lower for state and local entrepreneurs and, in general, a more favourable climate with regard to corporate taxes than in Maryland.
The district was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantages, Virginia is experiencing competitive pressure from its southern neighbour.
North Carolina had recently signed a legislative act reducing the corporate rate this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, as in Virginia, and the rate would fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continues to achieve its income tax targets next year, this law could lead to an income tax rate for entrepreneurs up to 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, a small business in the Washington area seems to be feeling better and thus pays more taxes at the state and local level, according to a recent study.
Tax for entrepreneurs paid in the form of an individual income tax by small business owners - a transitional structure whereby the majority of small firms are established - in the District of Colombia, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher rate of growth than taxes for entrepreneurs as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in business income across the country are likely to continue this year, with income from government and local income increased by 6.2 per cent for the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington area may be left because the reduction in federal spending affects the labour market in the region.
The Bronze Age of Russian Jew
The national peace champion of the Jews brought together Russia two silver and seven bronze awards.
According to this indicator, the Russians were given only the main favorite of the competitions of Japan.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and on the first day, the Russian team brought a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who was up to 60 kg.
In the same final fight against Baldbaator Ganbat from Mongolia, however, the outcome of the resistance was only one comment received by the Russians.
And this is the second day of the tournament, the most successful for the Russian assembly - three medals were immediately captured on Tuesday.
In men's competitions up to 66 kg of silver, Mikhail Pulaev was won and the bronze was Kamalu Han-Magomedov.
In the final alone, the Russians won the 2011 and 2013 World Cup for Japan's Massai Abinum.
Han Magomedov, at the fourth final stage of the lost companion, won the comfort tournament and became the winner of the bronze prize.
In the women's tournament, up to 52 kg, also to the third stage, Natalia Kuzuitina was the first to arrive.
In the semi-final, she lost the current peace champion, Milinda Kelmandi, from Kosovo, who was on this championship under the flag of the International Federation of Jews and successfully defended the title.
In the bronze dispute, Kusuitina won Ma Ianan from China, but at the end of the tournament, it was admitted that the third place was not exactly what she was looking for.
And once again, the Russian road to gold became Kelmandy, defeating Kusutin at the European final.
On the third day, Mousa Moguškov, a team of up to 73 kg, took a tournament in the Chelabina Bronze in a collection of Russians.
In the fourth quarter, he became the former representative of Moldova, Victor Skowartz, now a member of the OAU team.
However, the Russian won two awards and became the winner of the prize.
Moguškov spoke at the home championship with a golenopath trauma he plans to treat in the near future, so he will take a break in the competitions.
With regard to ex-Moldovian Square, he and he reached the bronze medal on the tournament.
Interestingly, Ivan Remarenko, a fellow member of the OAE sport nationality, completed a presentation of up to 100 kg in the Bronze category.
On the fourth day of CM-2014, the Russians also brought one bronze, which was won by Ivan Nifont in the category of 81 kg.
In a severe battle, he won the Frenchman Alan Schmidt with comments from the rival.
On Friday, three sets of prizes were played on the tournament, but the Russians by tradition were limited to one bronze in the male tournament to 90 kg.
She had become the holder of the Kirill Question, and this medal was guaranteed by the Russian assembly: his rival to the comforting final was the rival of Kiril Denisov.
However, there was no understanding: the rival Questionnaire was unable to get to Dads because of the trauma.
The male bronze was won by the owners and on the sixth day of the competition, she was put in a collection pool by Renat Saidov, who was in the category of more than 100 kg.
In the comforting finale, he won the pure victory over the Brazilian David Moore.
This was the end of the individual part of the world championship.
On Sunday, the last day of the tournament in Chile, the world championships played in command competitions.
Both Russian collectors - male and female - were one of the main candidates for prizes, but, as in individual competitions, the representatives of the fine sex did not get lucky - they did not get to the medal.
And here are the Russian Jews who won the command silver.
In the face of the decisive opposition, they have given priority to the Japan team's main competitions against the 2-3 account.
The Russian assembly said 2-0 after the clean victory of Han Magomedov and Volva - Dennis Jarzev (up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier categories of mass with their Japanese rivals, Murat Habatirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) were unable to cope.
The script also developed a bronze match in a women's tournament, where the Russian assembly, led by 2-0, joined the Japanese - 2-3.
The Russian President Vladimir Putin was present at the commandal competitions in Chelabinska, which, after the tournament ended, greeted the male with a silver band.
"The second place is very early, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could become champions," said Putin, whose word is the RIA News.
To lose the Japanese, the Jewish family, there's nothing ominous about it.
But I'm sure you can win them.
The Russian assembly at the world's home championship was much better than the previous year at a similar level held in Rio de Janeiro.
At the time, there were only three medals in the Russian team, one silver and two bronze.
Meanwhile, the current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstian and Mansur Isaev.
We're all, of course, big maximists.
Yeah, they want gold medals.
But let's remember, if a man in the Olympics is in the eight strongest, he's the potential winner of the Olympics.
More like a sport, like a Jew," said RF Sports Minister Vitalie Mutko, whose speech brings news of the championship.
The Assembly of Japan is expected to be the best in Chile, winning 11 medals of various dignity, five of which became gold.
The next world championship will take place in the summer of next year in Astana.
Other materials, news and statistics can be found on the summer sports page.
Joan Rivers' family is looking forward to the best
Joan Riverz is not aware of the hospital arrival in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed the hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Riverz in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai on Thursday after an emergency call that she had had a heart attack at a clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscope, reported sources.
Doctors intend to keep her under drugs and under strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “hard”.
The response was widespread, including numerous Internet support from such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
All the Kings Can Do
The debut album of the Royal Blood group is a new hope for the British year, which was released by the rock duate from the clubs as a front at the stadium.
Duet Royal Blood all year on the stage, but has already been actively nominated for the BBC Music Award, a tour of the Arctic Monkeys and a tour of the New York concert by Jimmy Paige himself.
Their debut single album received 100,000 orders a few months before the release, and the contract for its release is in Major-Lebla Warner Music portfolio.
Given the current weeping situation in the music market, the situation is emerging from a number of backgrounds, because it is not a new Lane Del Rey or a regular sweet-sweet representative of the "New R'n'B" but a duate of British people playing with that level of thunder and intensity that was last in fashion a couple of decades ago.
Overall, the rates on the first album for all the above circumstances were particularly high and have already been duly justified.
Duet has never seen a name that could have been reached before, but it's quite a desperate, hairy metallist, and the blood of the kings that they think they have in their homes, too, is understandable.
It is, of course, primarily about the heroes of the previous level Led Zeppelin: like a large quarter, Royal Blood is aiming to raise the blood of the British year, bringing it to a new height.
To make predictions about the company's success so far, please, it's been hurt, but something can be confirmed.
Ten songs that have been recorded in 30 minutes and a few minutes are not as much a demonstration of the phenomenal compositional gift as a sure and powerful declaration of intentions.
Some of the honours of individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: let's say, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by what is remembered, not by the melodic line, but by the drumban party.
The musicians in the joke say that it's just a little bit easier than a drink.
It is also worth distributing the powerful Little Monster and closing the patch of better Strangers with a Shakespeareic quote in the title.
However, it is true that each of these songs will sound great at the party of the year’s lovers, but when they are played in a row, they are merged into a more or less uniform canvas.
And that's not necessarily bad, even on the contrary.
The Royal Blood force is that they don't claim to be the Laver of the new Lennon and McCartneys (they're already in the Motörhead survivors), but they've got a lot of rock duets out of the ghetto Indian clubs.
Their music, despite some variety created for stadiums, in a room that is estimated to be less than a few thousand people, is obviously close to it.
The secret is partly in the clever use of the bass that replaced the guitar in the usual format that was invented at the beginning of the zeros The White Stripes.
In contrast, the case is not only in the instruments but also in the very approach to the making of songs.
The heroes of the zeros were very hard-working out of the postmodern paradigm, and were very reluctant to recognize themselves not just as the epigons but as the independent creative units.
Royal Blood is now sounding so powerful and sudden that this effort is successfully draining some of the secondaryity and stamina of the musical material.
Well, at the end of the day, who said that rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what the information reported on Friday morning: Online Store and Video Producer, and a hundred other things, buys a Twitch streaming service for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
This news turned out to be a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, selling a Twitch video service to Google for a good billion looked completely ready, and that combination seemed natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, aimed to be a common-source service, a real-time YouTube version.
Instead, he quickly turned into a platform where gamers broadcast their internal moments; "YouTube for real time," says Business Insider.
Interface Twitch.
And let's play, a genre of video clips that know how to give (mainly, old) the processing games, like in the Secret Theatre, are already popular on YouTube.
The thing is that YouTube is often mentioned when they describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch was met with no special interest, a classic example of a leading technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It's a secret why the YouTube deal failed, given that, according to the information available, it was ready to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have right now is a statement from Executive Director Twitch Emmett Shira: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, honestly speaking, is the incredible success of Twitch.
I'm kind of a snob that says that it's better to do sports than to watch it, it's hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking the jostics themselves.
One thing is to look through each other's shoulders at 3:00 a.m. when she walks through the Resident Evil, and another thing is to look at how a stranger gets 20 shots in the head in the Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are thought of as one person, so to look at their collection without controlling the angle of view alone may be a recipe for the main pain that is worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the fast paces in which the Rodgers of our electronic age finish all the games in record time are entertaining.
But if it's not about the virtuoso of the game or the humor, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel would be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics know about me?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and it is the fourth source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon work on this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will turn to Amazon Instant Video as well as YouTube could just swallow the Twitch.
However, Twitch has what any company would be pleased to get: crowds of young men who dream of advertising.
As head of Twitch Shir, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future" and this channel does not give evidence of confidence, even - oh - as a mature sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed as a result of the 2004 terrorist attack.
Over 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talking to the survivors -- almost all the time -- students, with the parents of the deceased, with the observer of the warehouse -- the City of Angelov -- Ramon Kaspolatov, head of the Committee "Mother Beslana" Susan Dudiev, who participated in the specialization of the PMS staff -- tells the correspondent of Elizabeth Antonov's Society, who was working on the special project.
As soon as he returned to Moscow, he met with Aslambek Aslahanov, who had been the president's adviser to the North Caucasus 10 years ago and had talks with terrorists, as well as with the government officer of the FSB Russia, Vajèslav Bocharov.
What really shocked me during the work on this topic is that in Beslan, it's as if there weren't any of those ten years.
This subject is extremely painful for all who have a relationship with it, and people are willing to talk about what happened.
The impressions from the trip are very difficult.
But you can't forget Beslan, and I hope we've done our job," Antonov said.
The project has been prepared by a study of Dutch Infographics Rambler & Co, who has been working in companies since spring this year.
Previous special projects were devoted to the First World War and 15 years of Vladimir Putin's residence in power.
The DPRK has launched a small-range missile
North Korea launched a small-range rocket in the Japanese Navy, reports Renhap.
About 10.30 a.m. local time was launched by the province of Chagando, on the border of North Korea and China.
It is assumed that the rocket crashed in the Japan Sea, about 220 km in the spring, declared in the Joint Committee of Chiefs of South Korea.
Deputies have proposed to speed up the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
If the initiative is successful, Russian data will not be stored on servers abroad since 1 January 2015
The Government introduced a draft law providing for the transfer of the date of entry into force of the Russian Personal Data Act from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative activities of the lower Chamber.
Its authors were Mr. Wadim Dengin, Mr. Yaroslav Nelov (LDPR), Mr. Evgenie Fedorov (“Russian Only”), Mr. Vladimir Parahin (“Russian Justice”) and Mr. Alexander Euštenko (CPRF).
This change, in the view of the sponsors of the initiative, will contribute to a more rapid and effective provision of the rights of citizens of the RF to the protection of personal data and to the confidentiality of correspondence on information and telecommunications networks.
The Act, which has been speeded up by parliamentarians, obliges the Russians to keep personal data processed via the Internet in the territory of the RF.
It also makes mandatory records, systematization, storage, storage, clarification and collection of personal data of citizens of the RF, in databases located in Russia, as well as information on the location of such databases.
In addition, the law grants Roskonadozor the right to restrict access to information processed in violation of RF personal data law by a court decision.
The Act also proposes the establishment of so-called “black lists” of offender sites, an automated information system entitled “Resistration of personal data offenders”.
This Act was adopted by the House of Commons in summer.
The authors of the bill made statements by Andrei Lugovov and Wadim Dengin of LDPR and Alexander Eušenko of CRC.
Dengin and Euštenko are also authors of the current bill on the date of entry into force of the law already passed.
Those who do not have RF's dates will have to pay for the lease.
Commenting on the draft bill of the Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin said that he did not see any problem in passing the date of entry into force of the Privacy Act.
According to him, companies that would not have their own Russian personal data storage facilities in the territory of the RF, could rent them, for example, “Rostelecoma”, which said repeatedly that they were ready to provide their servers in the rental and that they already provided their servers, to the Mail Group, to Western companies that are already providing their servers today”.
"There are also several independent centres ready to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If companies decide to enforce the law and continue to work in the territory of the FP, I don't see any problems - they'll get technological opportunities for placement," said Levin.
Controversy bill
As soon as the draft law was published, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications feared that, if the draft law was adopted, Russia would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, this is about online aircraft and aircraft mining services.
According to the association, “the bill deprives the personal data subjects of the right of the citizens of the Russian Federation to dispose of their own data in an imperative manner by determining that their records, systematization, etc. should only be provided in the databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement stresses that the establishment of a user information mechanism on the location of the record would be a more effective measure to systematize its personal data.
In such a case, you will be able to choose the area in which the above action will be taken.
The adoption of such "localization" personal data laws in other countries has led to the neglect of global services and significant economic losses.
The cold water test participant lifted the jaw
Isabel Roberts, from Britain, screamed so much when her head was pumped with ice water that damaged the bone structure of her face.
This test of ice water went wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she cried so during a cold-water test, which lifted her jaw.
Isabel Roberts screamed so furiously when her head was pumped with ice water that it damaged the person's structure.
"The water was so cold that I yelled, but when I did, my jaw began to cry," she said The Mirror.
The water's 20-year-old.
Isabel Roberts in seconds to the accident
I tried to close my mouth, but he didn't close, he locked up, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and my sister came up with the same understanding and they began to hesitate, but I had to rush to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old woman from the United Kingdom was taken to the hospital to conduct a post-participation exercise on Tuesday.
Clip became an Internet sensation and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The police transferred more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
The Forces of Novorossia claim that the Ukrainian Su-27 was defeated and accused of violating the ceasefire agreement.
At 10 a.m. on 1 September, the police transferred 402 prisoners to Ukraine, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported by the press representative of the Novorossia Army.
He added that “by the forces of WFP in the area of the village of Mereska, the Su-27 aircraft that violated the ceasefire agreement would be broken”.
According to the interviewer of the agency, the Ukrainian side, in the artillery shooting of the Lugan airport, applied cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions.
The representative of the press noted that policemen had been able to damage two Ukrainian WVV helicopters at one of the field airports at night, as well as to destroy two bronze carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
"The victims of the enemy's live force -- to a hundred people killed and wounded -- were captured by 13 people," said the chief's representative.
“Interfax” does not have confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, armed formations of the National Republic of Donbass declared the transfer of the Ukrainian side in compliance with the ceasefire regime of 223 detainees and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, on the night of the DND Army, according to the Army of Novorossia, "it has been attempted by the enemy in violation of earlier agreements to get out of the area of the environment a heavy technique."
At that time, the police reported the destruction of two tanks and two BPMs, six tanks and 198 troops.
According to the headquarters, the total enemy's losses in all directions (Denmark, Lugansk, Mariúpolis) that night were five tanks, eight armoured vehicles, more than 120 killed and wounded
At the end of the week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers were formed in the area of the militias in the Addis ska area in the Danube region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the “national republics” to expel Ukrainian soldiers from the area.
The DND agreed to do so, provided that the opponent was handed over weapons and ammunition.
The first tens of military personnel began to leave surrounding settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense "Donbass" Semen Semenchenko, 14 more people left the Kotla on Sunday night.
In his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded were "married by 137, 32 FF Divisions and 9 FF Tank Brigades", where they were treated well.
Meanwhile, the Russian Ministry of Defence and Defence rejected reports by Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
MID RF: Russia will take response to the introduction of new sanctions in the EU
Russia reserves the right to take response measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anthrosian sanctions, reports MID RF.
The Russian Foreign Office reports that the European Council ' s 'conclusions' of 30 August demonstrated the inability of EU member countries to overcome the insecurity of their unbiased support by the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia participates in the situation in the east of Ukraine, based on “absolutely unproven allegations of the presence of the Russian armed forces in the territory of the country”, states the department website.
The IMF regrets that, in spite of the interests of its Member States, Eurosovet is being influenced by countries that are interested in strengthening their confrontation with Russia.
Members of the Eurosevé must call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine, as well as for conditions for a full “dialogue between the opposing parties”, the Department stresses.
It is also noted on the website that there is no objective assessment of the humanitarian situation in Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has occurred, as well as the number of victims among the civilian population is growing.
Let me recall that during the next seven weeks in the European Union, concrete proposals are being made for sanctions against the RF.
In this way, EU representatives work closely with US officials.
They are expected to correlate the measures introduced during the period of action and the degree of severity.
The new sanctions of the European Union can be applied to energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced an increase in sanctions against Russia in the field of defence, finance and the oil industry.
Smart ways to save on university textbooks
While the value of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,100 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon be in second grade, thought of a clever way to reduce costs.
He developed a system of taking books to seniors by offering them nominal compensation to postpone their sale.
"My math analysis textbook, which usually costs $180, I got at the $10 semester and the Chick-fil-A oven," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at the Covent College in Georgia.
The required literature at last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the Board of Colleges, the secondary statistics student spends more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and training, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas similar to the Schroeder system.
The books are becoming more popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and often it is much cheaper than their purchase.
Nibo Incorporate, a company with over 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of books has increased twice since 2011.
The industry's studies show that about four books in university bookstores were taken out of hand during the last spring semester, says Vice President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the professional association “National Association of University Shops”.
This is an introduction course in the best way to make a good deal.
Buy online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price for a new book can be one third of what you see in the university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematic Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hosteller stands at about $290 per prequant, but a new copy can be obtained for $239.99 on Chegg.com, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of the detainee
If you're not against other marks or injuries held by the textbooks, it's a good option.
"Mathematic analysis" is sold for $93.49 in a supported form at Chegg.com.
Matt Cassedy, a 25-year-old fourth grade student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents at Amazon.com for a supported copy of the "Strategic Solutions in the Media: Understanding of the Business of Advertising".
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Bracie, director of the College of Walls at the University of Massachusetts in Emherste, offer students to clarify whether previous publications can be used.
At times, updates are not relevant for the exercise.
In such cases, the old editions can often be found at very little of the value of the last edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, which belongs to eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to the purchase of books.
Project
In order to take the books together, you have to think, if you're good enough to deal with them, don't forget to return them, and don't want to leave them after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the value of the new book.
For example, one student was able to take the math analysis for a semester of about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines that you can write for marks, accentuation and damage.
If you take the book by hand, remember: If you don't return the book, fines may even exceed the value of a new copy.
E-Books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are taken for granted by acquiring electronic licenses for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematic Analysis" project on Chegg.com for six months is about $61.
Braci says that students who study literature can often find the most profitable prices, as many classics can now jump free of charge, while natural and engineering literature can be very expensive.
No matter what, take a look.
Joe Golt, 29 years old, who is going to start a law school in Pepperdin, recommends using the ISBN number to explain book prices, as it guarantees that you are looking for exactly what you need.
Before making an order on the Internet, Holt says, you have to make sure that the book is in storage.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he had acquired was delayed for four weeks, and, at the end of the day, he paid the full price in the university bookstore.
Putin stated the full inefficiency of the Development Fund for the Far East
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, announced at a meeting on the management of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the long-east development budget investment fund, established two years ago, was ineffective, reported by Interfax.
"15 billion rubles remained on the deposits," the president stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State requested to accelerate the approval of the list of developing territories in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the establishment of TORs should be introduced to the House in that autumn.
The Federal Assembly, noted by 1 July, did not adopt the list of developing territories in the Far East and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also formulated key challenges for the development of the Far East.
Among them, increased transport availability in the region, the removal of infrastructure constraints - both in the internal market and for export development.
In addition, there is a need to create prerequisites for attracting additional investment in the region, as well as to form an emerging development area, which should become competitive in relation to the key business centres of ATR, the President stressed.
It had previously been reported that the development area could replace the OECD.
Why the "Glass Monitors" couldn't save the cash collection
"Unsustainable 3" Silvestra Stallone returned less than $30 million from its $90 million budget in the United States, while "The City of Sins: The woman for whom it is worth killing" returned only $12 million from her $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz's "Home Video" brought only $14.6 million to the first outputs, while children's movies, such as "How to Give Dragon 2" are also disappointed by the output.
The article by Telegraph Robbie Collin points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be in the wrong quality of the films themselves.
Collyn called 2014 "the worst" year in all history in children's films, and called "How to assign a dragon 2" just "functioning" the continuation of the fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the same as movies.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic of each film that went out in the summer in at least 2000 copies between the Memorial Day in May and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results that reflect the views of both filmmakers and film critics suggest that this year’s film crop is similar to the previous year’s hits.
Some commentators suggest that the case may be in changing vision patterns and growing popularity of Internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Favro, who is currently working on an upcoming Disney film "The Jungle Book" on the Hollywood Reporter website, said, "I think the times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to push for what was before.
Unlike the current drop in cash collection in Hollywood, Netflix's income from the flow of reproduction service reached $1.2 billion, almost doubled last year's figure of $837 million.
Last summer, Director Steven Spillberg criticised the studios for being too dependable on comics and predicted the "scrams" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators claim that his dark predictions were a part of the truth.
In the summer of 2015, several potential cash hits are expected, including "The Owners: Ery Altron", "Minionov" and "Ury Park", and other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
The producer "Ludy X" Simon Kinberg recently called the fall of cash collections just "cyclic," said Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the most cash summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Product sanctions are not to be feared by the owners of establishments with caucasian and medieval food, but Russian suppliers are a terrible dream for restaurants in Europe and Japan.
In general, it still prefers to replace prohibited imports not from Russia but from Latin America, Israel and China.

Mozarella and the cheese bourata ended up in the restaurant first, they have a little storage time.
The stockpiles of the parmesan should be sufficient for a few months.
What to do?
Going to Russian?
In 2005, I was in the Dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio is making such an eye, which is clear: shocking memories do not leave him so far.
The meat was lying on the carpets just 30 inches [30 cm] from the floor!
That's where the balls are!
Chris!
Then I said that for our restaurant, we will never buy anything in Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's all changed now.
But in the days I was being tested for fish from the Far East.
That's how she turned out!
I said I don't even want to talk to the man who brought this to us.
Valério is surprised that many things are common to Italy for the Russian producer in the wild.
A few years ago, I had to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is hung in a refrigerated chamber for 10 days at 1-2 degrees.
It has to hang to make the muscles soft.
I did all this with a local cow.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get that soft meat?
I said, it's yours, Russian!
Why don't you guys do that?
In five minutes' walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant Brasserie Most in the kitchen, there is a list of non-existent products: French oysters, seafood.
The head of the Brasserie Bridge restaurant and the Shot Bar Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: the French stringers have already replaced the strings from Tunisia, and instead of the French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
On the other hand, the Regis is becoming more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "The colour hood is 200 rubles!
I ask, "Why is she so much worth?"
They say, "We have to earn too."
But this coat should not cost 80 rubles!
We're buying the East Sides by weight, but they're 15-20 years old, do you imagine how heavy they are?
The price is that it's superdilicates.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of fear of foreign cover.
Standard story: "The first three months were all good, then the quality fell sharply."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable calibration and quality.
Many restaurants in the European kitchen don't know what to do with them when the cheese stocks are over.

Penalties Menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are essentially called product sanctions.
The import of beef, pigmeat, meat and offal from domestic birds, meat delicacies, fish, molluscs, milk, yogurts, cheeses, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups is prohibited in the country.
Restaurants have started a shop with suppliers: prices for products have grown, like in other countries, need to be looked for urgently.
This will be the strongest thing to say at expensive restaurants from the French, Italy, Spain, where products were placed directly from the "mother" countries.
The bath had to be reinvigorated before.
For example, when in early 2014, Rosselhozhnazzer banned the import of Australian beef and a year earlier, American and Canadian meat.
In exchange for supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the summer 2014 sanctions were much more serious.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which exclude from the prohibition of Atlantic salmon and forearms, unsweetened milk, seed potatoes, sugar maize, peas and garlic for sowing.
Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions can still be mitigated.
As long as part of the restaurant exists in uncertainty.
According to the West West company, one of HoReCa's largest suppliers, the import share of the premium was up to 70 per cent.
"Dorgo restaurants will have to change the menu under what local farmers and other countries produce," says Sergey Mironov, a restaurant owner of the Ristkonsalt agency.
If the boss is strong, it's not gonna be a problem for him.
We only have very little of this, and a new menu can be developed for two or three months.
The Trigel from the Brasserie Bridge restaurant is ready for this: to refuse 10-15% visas, another half menu is to be processed.
In restaurants with mixed kitchens, for example, the strawberry steaks are already being replaced, says Sergey Mironov.
"The cheeses from Europe can be replaced by the Russian, Belarusian cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile - the representative of the East-West company, Oksana Glibchuk, lists them.
Flowers and milk production from Europe are similar in Russia and Belarus.
A U.S. chicken may be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, a salmon and seven from Norway, a salmon, seven from Belarus and Chile.
The absence of fruit and vegetables from European production can be offset by the production of domestic producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
Mironov believes that the budget network restaurants will be redesigned simply than the premium segment: it is unlikely that there would have been a gourmet that could distinguish the Italian mozarel from the Russian.
Although it would be difficult for the Ginza Project institutions, he believes.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and their menus.
There will be a time to replace," Mironov says.
In Ginza, the comments were rejected, referring to the lack of owners in the country.
Café owners of the Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine stress that products from the former Soviet republics are more aromatic than European
But there are also many restaurants whose sanctions are almost inconceivable.
These include the kitchens of the CIS: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in the Georgian kitchen," says Hatuna Kolbay, owner of the Georgian Saperavi restaurant and the coffee "Wij Me!"
All the cheeses are made for us in Russia, based on a lot of chicken beans, we don't use exotic vegetables."
In the Colbai institutions, they haven't taken any candles out of the menu.
Timura Lanski, the owner of Chihon N1 restaurants from the Uzbek kitchen, is also not disturbed by the sanctions: he will only have to change his lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia makes imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win the price, it will be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he says.
The SNG can be cheaply cut, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit.
However, what they bring from Central Asia is much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
The Uzbek tomatoes all know they're delicious, sweet.
Nobody says that about the Spanish.
Following the imposition of sanctions, the representative of Uzbekistan Olymbai Artikov said that he planned to increase the export of fruit products to Russia by two by 2016.
The intention to replace European imports into Russia was expressed almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions by Belarus and Kazakhstan.
The fastfood restaurants that responded to Deneg's request also respond quite quietly to the sanctions.
The McDonald's Press stated that the location exceeds 85 per cent and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanova, the head of the Department of Supply Subway Russia, about 80 per cent of the network purchases in Russia, although temporary difficulties may arise with the supply of vegetables and rising prices for meat products produced from imported raw materials.
The term "authorization products" was not at all 4%.
They didn't touch the sanctions and the Waxker.
KFC, Burger King and Kroška Cartoška did not respond to Deneg's request, but other market participants claim that the location of Burger King is significantly less than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, the restaurants are ready to buy more Chilean than Russian in the Far East
On his hill.
While restaurants complain that the demand for prices increases even for local products.
"The prices for the Grabbles have increased by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian Cherry Mio restaurant, twice," says Roman Rožnikski.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of food increases by 5-10 per cent, and Colombia is recognized.
East-West does not deny this: "For example, Belarus' milk production has travelled 10-15% since early August".
"Brazilian suppliers have raised prices for pigs almost twice," complains Sergei Rack, Deputy Director General of Stardogs.
About 35 per cent of the chickens travel.
We're looking for a price from China, maybe they'll cool the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned price increase of 8 per cent.
Now and so reluctant to raise prices, says Cancer.
According to statistics, the growth in the second quarter of 2014 was only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest post-2010 rate.
Various prices will grow further, he recognizes, but it is not clear how quickly: while most restaurants have been stocked with products for the next two months in the hope of shifting purchase prices.
But what will happen two months later, no one knows.
There are dozens of boots decorated with greenery and wood on the square in front of the Moscow Mary.
At the center of the stage, musicians play golf.
It's a regional product festival called "There's a Time."
"We've been going to make a local food party for a long time, and here's a time of sanctions, we've had a lot of fun, we've organized a festival," one of the organizers says.
On the scene with Greek-brown musicians Anastas prepares macaroni salads and homemade confectionery, there was a master class on the days of preparation of a bar with caramelized apples.
All of the Russian products, the organizers assure.
The exhibition of the achievements of the Russian population in the camps.
Honey from Baschiria, Olenina from Salehard, fruits from the sub-muscular "Sovhoza name Lenin", cheese from the obese Italian Jay Clouz.
"The salmon for restaurants can easily be replaced by another salmon species from the Far East," says the owner of the fish "Your People" Philip Galkin.
We've got kidney, ketchup, cockroach, cockroach, a royal salmon.
Yeah, they're not as fat as a Norwegian salmon because it's a wild fish.
The Norwegian salmon is the same aquaculture.
You take him in your hand, he doesn't even move.
And you can't hold our far east salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace the Italian mozarel of the family
In the fall of his tent there are beds with a hint of "Magadan", spaghetti, omelet, muxun, and the Crem media, and the far East.
Galkin's sure it's been a long time since the Far East.
According to statistics, fish catches in Russia in 2013 amounted to more than 4 million tonnes, most of which go to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 are around 800 thousand tonnes.
The Love of His People has been working since 2012, selling fish through the Internet store, serving another half a dozen restaurants, such as "Empty Things".
There have now been applications from 15 restaurants to Galkin.
The same sushi can be made from our fish, it's burning.
We're frozen, we've tried different recipes.
We're selling the sushi through the Internet store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is cheap several times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
In confirmation of Galkin's hat, they're making me Philly's kit.
Unlike the roles of seven, they have to live longer, but the knowledge that this fish is our family adds strength.
On the site of "Your People" there are even the roles of the paltose and the sea otter.
In sushi bars, it is true that replacing the Norwegian salmon prefers Chilean.
Galkin explains this because I'm going to create new recipes with a remote eastern fish.
"The Russian fish suppliers have not yet offered us," explains the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitriy Evseev.
The same is true of other products: Russian producers could take advantage of the freeing of the niche, but this is not happening.
According to the founder and successor of the LavkaLavka Boris Akimova project, imports from Europe and America from China, Israel and Latin America could now be replaced.
There are large transnational corporations with powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to replace banned imports quickly, unlike our farmers.
That is to say, the major producers of other countries have won from the ban," Akimov says.
In contrast, the restaurant industry has received a more alarming signal in the last month than product sanctions.
Three McDonald's companies in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Ekaterinburg have been temporarily suspended following the mass out-of-the-range inspections of Rosusenazzora.
"We are studying the nature of the claims made to determine the actions needed for the early opening of restaurants for visitors," said Dengam in McDonald's press service.
No one really understands what's going to happen.
If all are restricted by product sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, - says an anonymous staff member of the restaurant consultant.
But if McDonald's is going to be closed all over the country, the script will be completely different.
"Europrotocol" instead of GIBDD
Cascade payments can be received without the IDBDD, so the CB intends to encourage the introduction of the Europrotocol in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft guidance that, since 1 September of this year, an insured car will be able to attend without the IDBDD.
To be true, it is only when an accident has been reported on the "Europrotocol" without the involvement of the road police.
That is, if only two cars were involved in the DTP, there were no physically injured persons, the damage did not exceed the prescribed limit and both drivers reached agreement on who was responsible for the accident.
From 2 August, the Europrotocol ceiling is 50 thousand rubbs, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad areas, it will increase to 400 thousand rubbs.
The point is that, often even in the case of minor injuries, in a situation where the DTP can be formed through the “Europrotocol”, the drivers who have fallen into the accident are causing the DPS.
Because if there was a policing helmet, it was impossible to get a refund without the IDBDD.
The parameters set out in the draft guidelines are intended to remove this obstacle to the implementation of the Europrotocol in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment of VAT-related helmets made without IDBDD staff should not be less than the limit on “Europrotocol”.
However, it cannot be higher than the limit defined in the helmet insurance contract.
The idea, of course, is useful and theoretically capable of unloading both DPS staff and roads.
But it's probably not going to get the car or the insurance company.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which could lead to the introduction of new rules on payment for helmets.
With regard to drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work would have to be done to overcome the former Russian conservatism.
In most cases, the driver will wait hours for the inspector to form a small accident because it is more reliable.
And I do not yet know that it will be easy to beat the frauds or convince the drivers of the 'europrotocol' reliability.
The safety certificate shall be named and unresolved
Minfin wants to prohibit the supplier's savings certificates, so he will allow the banks to make them similar to an irrevocable contribution.
Minfin prepares a bill that prohibits saving certificates from the supplier.
In recent times, this instrument has gained popularity, since the rates here are higher than on bank contributions.
The case is that the depositary certificates do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and they are treated cheaply by the bank, as no deposit should be made in the Fund of the Investment Insurance Agency (ASA).
The state of the articulation that this step is planned to be undertaken by small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates and are affected by Sberbank and Bank Moscow, which, according to the ASF, control 98 per cent of the profile market.
The share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the Agency, is about 3.5 per cent.
The problem, explained in the ASA, is that the clients of a small bank that bought such a certificate are trying to obtain money in the ASA if they withdraw from it.
Some investors who do not have sufficient financial literacy and who purchase savings certificates on the claimant may assume that their deposits are insured.
The underlying lack of insurance payments for these certificates may lead to misunderstandings and social tensions in the event of a withdrawal of a licence from the bank.
In practice, there were cases when the holders of the certificates tried to obtain a legal remedy," the ASC stated.
The problem is, of course, curious.
No one will be able to pay certificates to buyers because they do not have the right to be reimbursed by the State under the law.
If it were the case that an instrument was not insured in the ASA, it would also be prohibited to include metal accounts that are taken into account by citizens in grams of one of the four metals, gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but they are not tried.
The case is likely that the certificates on the applicant are very valuable documents that can actually act as Quasidenes.
However, their movement is virtually uncontrollable: any client of the bank may purchase a certificate, transfer it to any citizen, and before such a certificate can be found, a number of owners may change.
By no means does the bill stipulate that the safety certificate must be a valid price paper that must be stored in the depositary.
In order to send the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right to early termination.
That is to say, there is a similar unresolved contribution that the bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The outcome was protested by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered at the centre of Newport on a march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff's rat to see what was described as antisammite.
Stephen Fairklau was watching us for the development of events during the exits and talking to the protestors who came everywhere: from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will deploy weapons to Iraq to counter the militants from the Islamic State terrorist group, reporting ITAR-TASS on 31 August with reference to a decision taken following a meeting of representatives of the Government of the Frog in the head of the Chancellor of Angela Merkel.
Germany is reported to send 30 portable anti-tank missiles to Iraq and 500 charges to Milan, as well as 8,000 storms of G3 and G36.
The items will be implemented by the end of September.
In addition, the decision was made to allocate Iraq another 50 million euros for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will make a Government statement on the subject.
So far, Germany has not put its weapons in hot spots.
The views of the people of FRG on the dispatch of weapons to Iraqis have been divided.
Some believe that it is only possible to stop the fighters from the Islamic State, others fear that this weapon may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
The police have submerged the Ukrainian patrol station in the Asian Sea.
The Donetsk militias had a Ukrainian patrol station in the Azov Sea, ITAR-TASS reported on 31 August.
According to the data available, this occurred in the Taganrog Bay near the Shirokino and the Unnamed (10-20 km east of Mariopol).
A number of Ukrainian media reported shooting two yards of coast guard.
It is clear that the incident occurred today at around 4:20 p.m.
Adolescents picked up on the Blue Mountains helicopters
Two busucokers were delivered to the helicopter in a safe place after spending the night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
The 16-year-old girl and the 18-year-old were on the march shortly after Sunday at Govets Lip in Blackheit.
Concerned relatives called the police about 8 nights before they returned home.
A search team was sent, including local police and rescue units, and a couple found about 11 evenings around the Bridal Wayle Falls.
The girl had hurt her knee, and the young man had a headache.
The officers stayed with the couple for the night, and they were picked up on Monday morning.
They were taken to the emergency car in stable condition at the Blue Mountain Hospital.
Two Unions met
The negotiations at the summit in Minsk did not resolve the problems that had been raised but gave rise to a new format: the first European Union members met with the first people of the future of the Eurasian
Let it be also alarmed (the situation around Ukraine of delay not to wait), EU and customs union leaders first discussed a number of "burning problems".
If such a structure is capable of working effectively, it is impossible; therefore, it is clear who removed the stains from the summit.
Questions were raised on 26 August, when the Belarusians followed them and other Europeans saw in the audiences of the new President Lukashenko.
The Belarusian leader was an example of politeness, it was the behavior of a man who had just broken the Jackpot - and planned a decent old age in a higher society.
How Maydan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European Commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak on their behalf at the final briefing - not simply to legitimize the President with a 20-year internship.
This is an application for recognition by Minsk as a full-fledged entity for European policy and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The senior analyst of the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Research, Denis Melianzov, is sure that Brussels will no longer be able to talk to the same tone as it did before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met with the Tet-a-Teat with Lukashenko gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will be frozen further," he said.
The iceberg has a hidden part: the preparation for the break-in of the Belarusian authorities began long before the November Mayan in Kiev in 2013.
“The results have been achieved, and with the EU, these are successful visa facilitation and readmission negotiations, dialogues on modernization,” says the interviewer Fireka, and international security negotiations have been held with the United States.
The States even removed some sanctions.
With regard to Ukraine's events, they themselves and the leadership of Belarus have only undermined the process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, a Belarusian leader, who de jure, did not recognize the accession of Crimea to Russia and called for the punishment of the pro-Prussian militias in Donbass, did not fight with Moscow.
Minsk did not leave either the Customs Union or the DCCB, and the Russian base is located in Baranovic.
Brussels and Washington noted the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and assessed it as trustworthy Belarusian experts.
As successful as Lukashenko moves towards political diversification, it will be seen how often in the near future Minsk will have to meet in the form of EU+TS.
In the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expected from relations in a new format.
Press Secretary Ashton Maya Kosiancic has just stated "The Fire", that in the face of war and peace issues, this issue is not a priority.
It was reported that the next meeting on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first people in the new format could also become Kazakhstan.
The Chief of Staff for Minsk made a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbaeva, who recognized that he had been asked personally by the representatives of the Euro-Union.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties did not object to keeping Minsk a central place for meetings both in the form of the Russian-OSCE-Ukraine format and at the level of Heads of State and High Representatives of the European Commission.
This means that "the last dictator of Europe" is a full-fledged European leader who helps solve the global problem.
Better friend of a European farmer
The membership of the EU delegation, including the European Trade and Energy Commissioners, has already encouraged the conclusion: the main sub-level of the summit is not the tragic situation in Donbass, but the economy.
Indeed, the forthcoming negotiations on gas supply and overcoming the fears of the TC countries on the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU are more than the peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
The Trade Commissioner Carl De Gucht, however, pointed out that EU representatives “come to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis that has economic consequences rather than the opposite.”
It seems, however, that the crisis in Ukraine also "works" in Belarus.
Its consequences -- and, in particular, the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia -- give Minsk, which is still experiencing the sanctions themselves, a long-term field for manoeuvre.
According to the Head of the Mises Research Centre, former candidate for President Jaroslav Romanchuka, European investors are actively interested in Belarus's ability to deliver agricultural products to the RF in the course of sanctions.
The delivery schedules for which Vladimir Putin has hurried to the summit are being put forward.
"Initiators of this scheme," said Romanchuk "Ognyk", "are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out product delivery schemes, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.
The Russian business is urgently needed to restore them, even through the mediation of the Belarusian structures.
The second issue, the expert continues, relates to the fact that many Ukrainian companies will not continue to produce production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials, as well as to the direction of the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarusian trade schemes can now be very expensive."
In Romania's view, the role of the host of the EU and TS negotiations is ideal for Lukashenko and for the development of economic relations with Europe.
He recalls that the EU agricultural sector's losses from Moscow's sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, while the European Commission has now offered only 125 million euros to farmers.
The Belarusian President may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the impact of Eurofarmers.
This can raise Lukashenko's authority in the EU at an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk has a strong role to play in the TS+EU format, while the Belarusian leader at the meeting with the Ukrainian colleague stressed that the new format was the originator of Kiev.
"It was your proposal to gather, without any discussion, not from the barracks to decide, after signing the Treaty on Association with the EU, to deal with the situation that had been in Ukraine at that time," he said to the camera to Petru Poroshenko.
On the other hand, observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which, according to the hearing, was originally against the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increased its political weight.
In the Belarusian Diplomatic Authority, it was strongly stressed that Belarus did not pursue any useful objectives in the organisation of EU and TC interactions on its ground, and the ultimate goal of such a format was the creation of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
“This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that, in other areas, particularly in the field of security, are putting forward and advancing the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation,” said "The Fire" in the Middle East of Belarus, an institution that has recently been scrupulously chosen.
In Moscow, there may be a free entry zone
The Government of Moscow considers the introduction of free entry zones as a means of combating overload of central roads similar to other major cities of the world, reports M24.ru with reference to the Mosque dam on transport Maxim Likstuv.
One of the options that he has successfully recommended is a pay entrance.
That's an expert opinion, we'll have to study it, we'll look at all the mines and the pluses.
To say that some decisions have been taken in this regard so early," Liksutov said.
Zimmera stressed that the capital authorities had a very important experience in Asian cities, which, in terms of structure and load, was similar to Moscow.
One of the decisions taken by these countries was the construction of the central wheelway, Liksutov added.
The recent construction of the Central Wheel Road is an example of not having to miss all traffic through Moscow.
If there was sufficient traffic infrastructure for the ride, there was no need to have transit traffic in Moscow," she said.
Max Luksutov also stated that the introduction of paid parks had significantly derailed the streets.
And, according to him, the capital authorities do not intend to stop on the achieved.
On 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital Sergei Sobianin attended the ceremony of the construction of the first Moscow Central Wheeling Road (CCD).
KHotKeys update utility
The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodríguez "The City of Sins 2: The woman for whom it is worth killing" has not accomplished the revolution that could have been expected from him.
The first “Courage of Sins” (2005), taken from the minimal, but symbolic, participation of Quentin Tarantino, has revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comics and literary nuances.
The cycle is also revolutionary: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental to modern thinking of the string of "thesis-antithesis-synthesis" (if you understand under these universe nuaras and under the antithesis-composite space).
It should now be read: "Thesis - Antithesis - Chaos."
"The City of Sins-2" is chaotic in both dramatic and philosophical levels, both of which he is chaotic in the foolish sense of words.
Yes, part of the heroes are known for the first "Gorod," although, here, the marv (Micky Rourke), remembers, ended his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing but succeeds in exorcising - in the role of a folk wife - from the air of the knife and other punching sticks.
But the elders literally drag away the new ones, like they're breaking into the city from some other film, about the meaning and purpose of which the viewers ask not to worry.
So, his story, foolishly beaten by the authors in the most interesting place, is in the superlative game of Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
It's got a wanted-frigid Eve Lord (Eva Green) and something to blame for Duyta (Josh Brooklyn).
But this confusion in which Duyta, let's say in person not to be different from Johnny -- the more people, as well as other parts of the body, carry characters with incalculable regularity, not misery or even half-life.
It's not people, but we understand it's an archetype of nuara: a year-old bitch who's too confident of herself playing a "moon hunt" for a sex detective, a corrupt senator.
Well, when the archetyp moves with the archetyp and the archetyp moves, it's not a movie anymore, but it's an abstract life.
And asking abstract questions about the logic of the subject is just ridiculous.
In addition, even in this compatriot world, there is something constant.
The warheads of the first "Gorda" continue to hold a round defense against their native black forces.
Yeah, and Detective Hartigan's ghost isn't, and he's gonna look at the fire, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem of "The City of Sins-2" is the other.
Frank Miller was good at the fact that the painter had a talented comic book and a comic book, and as a director, he had turned his idea of how to put comics on the screen.
Comics and nuars are two aggressively opposite "realities".
A contemporary comical phenomenon was born at the end of the 1920s, when the novels of Dashil Hemmet "Crowding Harvest" (1929), "Maltian Soccoli" (1930) and "Secret Key" (1931) created a cannon named after the hard-boiled school.
Well, or pulp fiction.
The comics gave Gollivud many dozens of heroes: from the sailor Poppay, a spy who gave him a rich power, Superman, Batman, and the treasurer Dick Tracy to Halka, Tora, the Spider Man, and others.
But in any comic movie, there was something harmful: painted characters did not want to grow up on the screen, remained hostages in the environment of their "real" world's will-evils.
I'm just saying, they were completely out of existence.
Nour, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After World Wars, the traditional novel, with its experiences, character, family scandals and the historical background, lost all confidence.
What sites, which Tibo and Rugon-Makcara, even the Balkan and Rostos do we think after Verden, Osvencim and Hiroshima?
Such a novel had a peaceful mutiny in the form of a mythical opera, and a criminal - that is, a marginal - novel had risen to the level of the philosophical prose.
Hemmet on his skin found out it was working as a health worker on the front.
He was a communist.
Like, at least, they were close to the party and the columns of the genre, such as the writers Horas McCoy and Jim Thompson, director Julessen, Joseph Louzi, Edward Dmitrick.
So the nuar, whose archetype they put, first, rough and cynic, and secondly, essentially social.
That's not the American version of socrealism.
The First Town of Sins was remarkable in that it was unnatural but organically combined comics with nuara.
For the first time, the comic book lived on the screen, not to be narrowed by its graphic nature, but to be a "present" film.
The dark of the sale world, where the cardinal ordered the murder, and the senator covered the monster-sadist son, was worthy of Hemmet.
And the pictures of the sort of cut heads that the sadist decorated his nest, before Gen. James Ellroy, the author of the Black Orchid, and the best - that is, a declaratively gifted representative of the Neonura.
"The City of Sins-2" is not even a retreat, but a capitalization of the radical stylistic of Miller -- Rodriguez before the comical tradition.
It's probably a lot of things that happened because of 3D technologies.
When you look at the second "Crowd of Sins", you feel trapped in a glass layer in which snow sleeps a toy.
In fact, most of the time, it's not snow, it's blood, but what's the difference?
Well, it's about sociality and it's about something.
It's only possible when we have something somewhere, somewhere else, let's go to the edge of the dirty mud, but there's a normal world where we can get the girl back on the curve or tell the desperate parents that her loser is punished.
But when there is no place for sin, there is no place for sin, neither is there any place for sin, but that which is common.
It's boring, like any rule.
The chaos of "The City of Sin-2" is just bored.
Justice for a family curse has given this fine sin a small but a small one.
The headlines warn: the film contains harmful smoking scenes.
As for maturity, in the very vegetative episode, which breaks the fingers of a person with his fingers, it gives a hell of a humor.
Hemmet would like it.
The socialists of France must "close and bring France in order," said key ally Frasua Holland
Mr. Wall called for the deeply divided left forces to “show a warm attitude” towards the attacking socialist president whose interpretations had not been approved by the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, deserves our loyalty, deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay close to him," he said, calling out applause.
As a sign of reconciliation, the Prime Minister assured that his Government would not question the 35-hour working week in France, despite the proposals for a heated conflict, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economic Affairs earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland asked his socialist party associates to remain “one” with the Government.
However, Christian Tobir, the Minister of Justice, has put sticks in the wheels by bringing together the disagreeable members of parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lost faith in the future”.
Marine Le Pe, the leader of the extremely right National Front, expressed contempt for permanent internal conflicts among Socialists, said that she did not imagine that the new Walla Government would last for several months.
François Olland is a naked king, but a naked prince and Prince Manuel Wall, who is forced to gather a new government when the summer was not over.
"And the new one won't last long either in the autumn or winter," Mrs. Penn told reporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that she was convinced that the party could easily win in the early elections and be ready to manage.
The leading French party survived a riot in the March municipal elections, and the very right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
The survey of the resurrected Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of being divided into several rival factions until the end of the presidential term of Mr. Holland in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a politician at the University of Siance Po, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government failed to correct the economy and the record unemployment.
"He has little time, but the public opinion needs to quickly feel what's changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
"The city without drugs" is missing.
The Sverdlovska arbitral tribunal left without consideration the request of the Regional Ministry for the Management of responsibilities to the State without drugs fund.
The government was planning to recover more than 7 million dollars from the organization as a rent fee for a building in the centre of Ekaterinburg.
However, the complainant did not appear twice in court.
Today, the Sverdlovska District Arbitration Court has left without consideration the claim of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management (IUGISO) to the State without drugs fund (one of the founders - Mayor Ekaterinburg Evgenie Roizeman).
Representatives of the district authorities intended to recover from the organization 7.3 million rubles as rents for the building.
It was known today that the complainant had not appeared twice before the court, so a decision had been made to refuse the hearing.
Due to the lack of a representative in the IUGISO department to explain, the Chief of Legal Affairs, Maxim Titov, did not respond to telephone calls.
The Fund also failed to contact representatives.
Remember, this is an item that has been operating in the city centre on the street of Bellinski, 19 on a free basis since 2011.
This was decided by former Governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Governing Directorate of the Ministry of Public Property Management of the Sverdloven Region applied to the Sverdloven Arbitration Court for eviction from the building.
According to the claim, the institution requested through the court to recognize the unconsolidated contract of free use of a memorial space.
In the opinion of the IUGISO Directorate, the agreement did not include substantial conditions for renting cultural heritage.
The Sverdlovska arbitral court rejected the claim, and the 17th arbitral court of Perma was appealed.
In the same court, the fund then filed a cassation complaint against the decision, which remained unsatisfying, and the decision was subsequently appealed by the fund in the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court accepted the direction.
In 2013, a new lease contract was concluded, on which the fund began to pay the rent again, as explained by the head of the city of Eugenie Roiseman.
The rental fee was set at 300 grand a month.
The previous administration of the area transferred this building to us for free, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, in respect of the fund.
The current administration has decided differently," he said.
Tatiana Drugeva, Ekaterinburg
Why Mayor Ekaterinburg offered to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, the proud deputy of Ekaterinburg unicorn Alexander Kosinsev invited the mayor of the city, the proud speaker of Evghan Roizman, to resign.
The cause was a criminal case in relation to a suspect in the murder of a retired member of the pride of Olega Kineva, who was considered a mayor ' s accomplice.
How Evgija Roizman found a criminal case
On 1 July, it became known that a criminal case had been initiated on the fact of the “crime” (art. 128.1 C.U.F.) in the Ekaterinburg Mayor's blog Eugenie Roizman.
This was reported by Anna Filatov, Director of the Law Centre, Sverdlova, where she made a statement.
According to her statement, Mr. Roseman accused her of being a member of the blog that she was involved in crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
Mary Ekaterinburg is convinced that "it's a regular attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone turns into a cookie
Before 9 September, when Apple was due to present its new development, the press reported all the new leaks that could be expected from the presentation.
With reference to American media sources, the sixth generation of iPhones will be equipped with a mobile cookie as a result of the joint project Apple and Visa payment systems, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Re/code Internet Resource, on the presentation of new products on 9 September Apple can also announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, which will make the new iPhone 6 smartphone available.
The companies themselves have refused any comments on this.
This function enables you to pay for a shopping bag using a smartphone.
The identification of the payment will be carried out by the user by fingerprinting the finger using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will have NFC technology (near field communication) for the first time, which enables the wireless payment using a smartphone and the appropriate cash-in-the-box reader.
The NFC technology itself will be available through a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The first NFC function was presented in 2004 as part of the cooperation of Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that entered the so-called NFC Forum, an association for the advancement of this technology.
The first NFC phone was issued by Nokia in 2006.
The first smartphone on Android with NFC function - Samsung Nexus S - was presented in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced a Google Wallet system that allows users to attach bank cards to their Google account and to pay for using a smartphone on Android.
In contrast, American experts stress that, despite the major investments of high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, U.S. cyclists are still careful about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on their stores with such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple's entry to the market will make it faster and more active in its trading areas.
Mid-France: Paris's position on delivery to Russia "Mistrally" has not changed
The official representative of MIDI France, Roman Nadal, stated that Paris was in a constant position to deliver the "Mistral" helicopters to Russia.
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (Françao Holland) in his interview with Le Monde on 20 August: "Today's level of sanctions does not prevent supply.
It's a decision of Europeans, not of France," Mr. Nadal "RIA News" quoted.
Thus, the representative of the French foreign policy authority replied to the question of whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would result in a change in the position of Paris to implement this contract.

Norwegian Cruise is approaching $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is at the final stage of negotiations to acquire a similar company Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion, according to reports of people familiar with the situation.
The transaction would provide Norwegian Cruise, companies with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to luxury cruise ships and secured Prestige Cruises customers, as it competes with larger competitors Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could be announced this week, reporting sources on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also holds 20 per cent of Norwegian Cruise shares.
The sources were asked to remain anonymous, as negotiations were not open.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 per cent more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, is working under the flags of Oceania and Regent, which together have eight cruise ships operating in Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported income of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 per cent higher than a year earlier.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to have a positive impact on the growth of the middle class in developing economies, such as China and India, in the years to come.
The forward companies seek to position themselves as cross-operators preferred by these new clients.
Prestige Cruises was registered in U.S. regulatory bodies for the primary public placement of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the company's principal shareholder after a $850 million transaction in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it now exists, in 2000 as a result of a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment and a casino under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Tea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting had a share of 28 per cent, Apollo had a share of 20 per cent, and the private investment company TPG Capital LP had a share of 8 per cent in the company, as reported at the end of June, according to the reporting.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 per cent of the cruise traffic in North America, according to the registration documents for the first public placement of Prestige Cruises.
Crime TV can get 250 million rubles of subsidies
In Minsk, Russia is proposing to allocate 250 million dollars to the Crimean State Radio Company in 2014.
As indicated in the draft decision of Minkomsvezi, which is located on a single portal to disclose information on the preparation of regulations, the subsidy is planned to be spent “to cover the cost of creating conditions for the wide coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of the modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.
Money will also go to the purchase of equipment, roof repair and energy security systems in the 1959-based radio company building, reports “RIA News”.
Activists of the Hong Kong Democratic Movement hold the Chinese representative's statement on the following day after the election decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood near the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the All-China People's Assembly on Sunday established a procedure whereby only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the election of Hong Kong leader in 2017.
All candidates must first receive support from the majority of members of the movement committee, which is likely to be a handful of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to go to the election ballot and has forced the democratic movement activists to promise again to stop Hong Kong's financial centre with the Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders are afraid that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication by Beijing of a document describing China's control of Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the business centre of the city and set up a sit-down.
Briefing Li is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Office for Communications in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the People ' s Assembly of All China and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Bureau of the Feng Wey State Council also had to make a series of briefings during the day.
Activists stated that they would gather at the Hong Kong Government's capital building in the afternoon.
Britain has not mentioned the democratic governance of Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to join 400 ha of the land of Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities announced that they would join 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, owned by Palestinian autonomy.
As Bi-Bi-si reports, the decision to join South Wyclim is linked to the desire to pay for the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli teenagers in June of this year.
On the capture of the territory, the Ministry of Defence of Israel announced on Sunday and ordered military administration on the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, the world community should call upon Israel to respond to “the ongoing settlement activity on the west bank of Jordan and in East Jerusalem”.
Putin requires Kiev to start negotiations on the statehood of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Sunday that the Ukrainian Government stop fighting separatists in the east and immediately start negotiations on the Statehood of the separated region.
His press secretary, Dmitri Peskov, later explained that Putin had no intention of suggesting that the eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of separatists would be part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine should be reviewed in order to enable the Russian-speaking region to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putina's call to the Kyiv Government to begin negotiations with the pro-Pro-Pro-Pro-Assisi rebels as well as a clear strategy to be followed five months ago: To help separatists to take up the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossia real independence to approach Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with Putin State's First Television channel, the Ukrainian military campaign condemned the return of detained separatists in eastern Doneck and Lugan, which were seized in March and April following Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently named the territories seized by Novorosia, or New Russia, which refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believed that peace negotiations would take place in the near future when Ukrainian policies began campaigning for parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government forces were attacking peaceful settlements in secarid regions, the Illusion Guard reported.
"We must start the substantive negotiations immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political device of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, in order to express the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putina's words about statehood were meant in the context of wider autonomy, which had been discussing for months with the leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm the fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were at risk.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict”.
The intervention of the Crimean Press Secretary to correct Putin ' s “infidel interpretation” stressed the decision of the Russian leadership to take a separatist stand in the east rather than the open grip of Crimea, where most of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much more difficult battle to join even the Doneck and Lugansk area of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million non-Russians did not, and the pre-conflict polls showed widespread support for the wish to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy discussed by the Russian diplomats at international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact, by handing the Kremlin the actual control over the territory, which would unite the main Russian territory with Crimea.
The main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historical sea resorts, is located on the Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov Region and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and Lithuanian factories that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed, during his opening speech on 7 June, that Ukraine's legislators, after the new elections, amend the Constitution to give separate regions greater control over their finances and language status.
However, his view of autonomy appears to be very different from that of Kremlin and rebel separatists, whose weapons and incitement are being accused of Moscow.
Putina's last call to Kiev to agree with the separatists' leaders, as well, followed the new arrivals of the rebels last week after the Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from the former peaceful area along the Azov Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took control of the city of Novozazovsk in the event that Ukrainian security officials said they were afraid that it was the beginning of a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory before Crimea itself.
This has resulted in extensive civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupola, a steel gate with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between the Novoazovski and the close passage to the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, he called on the European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which was independent.
"We're approaching the turning point," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for more severe sanctions against Russia to be taken in the event of an escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Addis sia after two columns of Russian armoury and 1,000 soldiers entered the Danube region last week to support the difficulties faced by separatists, Colonel Andrey Lysenko, the Press Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were reportedly detained in Addis Ababa as a result of the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday with 10 Russian air carriers caught in the Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko reported on Sunday.
The photo scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his aversion to hackers who may have stolen his bride Gabi Greco's embezzled photos and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood regrettably, after a number of unveiled photographs depicting Jennifer Lourens, he entered the Internet as a result of a huge hacker scandal with celebrities.
They say that the hacker, responsible for this, has about 60 exposed photos of the star "Frozen Games" Lawrence and the superstars, including the models Kate Apton and Kara Delevin, the singer Ryanna, Ariana Grande and Lia Michel and the actress Kirsten Danst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Ivonn Strahovski and living in Melbourne Greece also allegedly stole photos from the iCloud escape.
In list 101, the names of the celebrities.
Edelsten, who made a proposal to Greece last month, said Confidential: "This is disgusting."
All private censuses and photographs must remain private.
It is terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to others.
Greco, who is in New York, reportedly told the news site that the hacker attack was "stupid" and that those she was sent to “suffer that they were attacked”.
The hacker is supposed to have 30 photographes of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two frames where she lies in the pool with a loaded chest.
Palmer's work in the movie includes "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, a movie star called Chuck Strahovski and an actress from Browning's "Prohibited Admission" yesterday did not comment on stolen photographs.
The representative of Lawrence told TMZ, "This is a sudden invasion of private life."
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his frustration at hacker, writing on Twitter: "Relate photos stolen from the mobile phone, in fact, nothing is different from the sale of stolen goods."
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen photographs cannot be tolerated.
A potential way to steal photos of detected celebrities has been found
A massive breakdown of the account stars may have been made through vulnerability in the Find My Phone annex.
The potential scenario for the development of events described the resources of The Next Web.
The Python script was published on Gitub's resource, which enabled the Apple Find My Phone service to select passwords.
This service allows you to track the location of your iPhone.
The same connection between the logo and the Apple ID password is used for accessing the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photos of celebrities have been stolen.
The script enabled you to get a password from Find My Phone.
This method consistently introduces all possible combinations of symbols, starting with the most frequently used passwords.
The author of the script argued that the Find My Phone service had unlimited password entry options.
In the correct organization of the security system after several unsuccessful attempts, the account must be blocked and reported to the user.
Due to vulnerability, users received no reports of attempts to improve their account password.
The hackers knew the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to the Twitter user Hackapp, vulnerability was detected two days ago, on Saturday, and written a script program for the selection of passwords.
The vulnerability is now closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource was connected to the Hackapp user and he noted that the above vulnerability was characteristic of many services, but noted that there was no evidence that it was such vulnerability that it was used to access the star account.
It's not me, plz RT
On Twitter, the Prime Minister reported on a number of occasions
While there was no strong evidence that the use of this service had been used for the theft of photographs, there had been a wave of harmful actions.
The hackers took over the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple stated to the media that the security of the cloud had not been compromised, but did not investigate how users had lost their accounts.
Russians had also been hacked into the Twitter of Prime Minister Dmitria Medvedev.
If the criminals had access to the iCloud as described above, there could be a password on the account of the head of the Government in the microblogging service.
The Next Web resource could not get Apple's comments on the vulnerability of Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to Ukrainian five-year-old
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian sportsman Anne Burjek.
The relevant order is published on the legal information portal.
At the beginning of this year, the sportsman moved to Russia to a permanent place of residence and asked the Federation to provide her with an opportunity to speak for the RF collection.
In 2013, she won two phases of the World Cup, won a silver medal for Europe in a personal championship, and became a world champion in a mixed stage, which is one of the new types of sports programmes.
It also holds leadership positions in the current season.
In accordance with the rules to speak at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, it will be required to obtain a special authorization from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee.
Anna Burrac is not the first Ukrainian sportsman to change his nationality.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian chess passport to Ekaterine Lagno, the Livova breeding, which is a two-time European champion (2005), a world of twins (2010) and a fast chess [14].
A female team of Ukrainian sportsmen was the winner of the chess Olympics in Turin (2006), the World Championship in Astana (2013) and the European Championship in Warsaw (2013).
DRC terminated investigation of the Tu-204 disaster in Nukovo
The Russian Investigation Committee (RCR) has terminated the criminal case of the aircraft crash of Red Wings.
This is reported by the department's press.
The decision was taken with regard to the death of the commander of the aircraft and the bartender.
The Judicial Expert showed that the result of the disaster was an increase in landing speed, failure to perform standard landing procedures, as well as an unintended exit of engines to increased direct traffic.
The Tou-204 aircraft of Red Wings, following the Prague-Moscow flight, suffered a crash on 29 December 2012 at the Moscow airport of Vnukovo.
The aircraft was blown off by an airfield and burned down.
The commander of the aircraft, the second pilot and the bartender were killed at the scene.
Two pilots were delivered to the treatment facilities, where they were subsequently terminated from the injury.
Three other pilots, hospitalized with severe bodily injury, have undergone long-term treatment.
In addition, severe bodily damage was caused by the driver of the car that was driving at the time of the Kiev Shoss disaster.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
After the disaster, the Transport Prosecutor's Office carried out a check on Red Wings, which identified numerous violations.
In February 2013, the company's licence was suspended.
The company resumed its work in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Emelianenko started training in SISO
A well-known Russian mixed-style fighter of the 33-year-old Alexander Emelijanenko, who is in the SISO on charges of sexual assault against the household, has been completely cured of trauma and has started training.
That's what the Championship reports.
In May this year, the Russian Investigation Committee filed an accusation against Alexander Emelianenko.
The suspect was reported to have been investigated, and on 9 May he was detained in Tambova following a road accident, resulting in a fracture of his thigh.
The Emelianko-younger was arrested until 31 August and sentenced on 1 September.
However, the court was transferred, and the prosecution insisted on extending the term of detention until 30 September.
If a sportsman is proven guilty, he is threatened with imprisonment for up to six years.
What power, brother?
Lenta.ru remembers the most scandalous stories in Alexander Emelianenko's career.
He spent his last meal in January of the year, losing his technical roommate, Dmitri Sosnowsk.
Alexander is the younger brother of the most famous fighter, Fedor Emelienko.
The last is a four-time world champion of mixed martial arts, a four-time world champion and a six-time Russian champion of combat sambo.
Anger was the most universal and functional emotion in human history.
The warm expression of a person is biologically universal to humanity, and each member of the body and group of muscles is not a coincidence, but is an additional means of expressing power and threats, identified by scientists in Australia and the United States.
They told about their openings in the magazine Evolution and Human Behavior, and they can be read briefly in the press release of the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the person - pushed and thrown down the gates, drawn in the thin line of the mouth, scattered noses - is the same in all cultures, and makes him even blind from the birth of a child, never seen him, notes the lead author of Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion has arisen to deal effectively with disputes during the conflict.
The more physical damage one person can cause to another, the more he has the ability to dictate his condition, the more he brings it to the interviewer with anger.
Researchers have also found confirmations and another hypothesis: physically strong people are more angry and more likely to go to work, consider themselves entitled to impose on others conditions that are not beneficial to them, and prefer strong ways of dealing with conflicts peacefully.
Taking away from the fact that anger is primarily a “emotion of the market”, scientists have decided that the movements of each of the seven groups of mice that create angry expressions should represent an angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interviewer, thus making it possible to agree with his or her conditions as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.
To verify this hypothesis, the researchers modeled and showed them to the informant on a computer where each of the seven elements of an angry person was present or not.
Although the missing bridges or the forward bulkheads did not make a person evil separately, the stronger physical participants of the study were unitedly identified with such human demonstrators.
Man's anger, as in animals, is a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of his own power, which requires consent and obedience.
A man spreads his noses and lifts his lips for the same purpose as a couch that climbs, or a baboon that shows his claws.
“Angrily “starts” by refusing to accept the situation of the interviewer, and the person immediately adopts the form, which is most effectively demonstrated by the opposing party, of the consequences of the refusal.
But the most striking is that none of the elements of an angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same," noted Anthropologist John Tuby.
Mincoms has proposed to allocate 250 million rubles to the Crimean Radio Company.
Minkomswiss proposed to allocate 250 million rubles from the federal budget of the autonomous non-commercial organization Teleradio Company Crime in 2014.
This is reflected in the draft Government decision prepared by the department, which is known as Lenta.ru.
According to the explanatory note to the project, subsidies from the federal budget will be directed “to cover the cost of creating conditions for the wide coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of the modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment”.
In particular, the dedicated money is intended to refurbish the equipment and studio block, video screen, central hardware and video server.
The acquisition of a mobile television station and satellite transmitter is also planned.
In addition, the company will pay for the use of the fiber optic communications line (WOLS) and the maintenance of the energy system.
Subsidies will be provided within the federal budget provided for the Mincomsbezi.
The Crimean State Broadcasting Company was established in 1959, delivering a message in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, the coverage of the television broadcaster is more than 75 per cent of the territory of the peninsula.
In 2011, the Crimean Television Company received a digital television licence.
