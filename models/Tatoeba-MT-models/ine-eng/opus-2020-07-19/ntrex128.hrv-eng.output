The Great Assembly Representatives are concerned that "will look like Muppeti"
Some assembly representatives (Assembly Member, AM) proposed that they be called representatives of the Great Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament, MWP).
It was also due to plans to rename the assembly to the Belgian Parliament.
Congregational representatives from all political groups were concerned that they could become the subject of the strike.
A congregation representative from the Laborist Party said his group was concerned about the name "remotes with Twp and Pwp".
For reading outside of Wales: on the big twp means stupid, and pwp ass.
A congregation representative from the party of Wales (Vols. Plaid Cymru) said the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
The Great Conservative said his group was "open" to change names, but that MWP could quickly be converted into Muppet.
In this context, the word "w" is spoken similarly in the word "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing a law to introduce a change of name, announced the following: "Of course, the final decision on how the representatives will be entitled to be on their own."
The law of the government of Wales, 2017, gave the Welsh Assembly the authority to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that have gained broad support for changing the name of the assembly in the Belgian Parliament.
When it comes to what representatives will be called in the assembly, the Committee was inclined to call the "members of the Great Parliament" or the MWPs, but the MWP option received the greatest support during the public consultation.
The representatives of the Assembly propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could lead to better meetings of the President of the Elin Jones Assembly, which is expected to put forward a bill on changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Law will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the disqualification of representatives of the assembly and the establishment of a committee system.
During the discussion of the law, the representatives of the congregation will have a decisive vote on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians go to a referendum on the country's name change
Voters will vote on this Sunday if they want to change the name of their country in "North Macedonia".
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents its own Greek territory and repeatedly opposed the launch of its EU and NATO accession procedures.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not recognise the referendum decision.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that the change in the name is a simple price that has to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bell was silenced while churches in Harlem fight for survival
"The older people I spoke to said that in the past there could be at least a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"There's nothing today."
He said the disappearance of the bar is understandable.
"People are joining today in another way," he said.
"Bars no longer represent the living rooms of a neighborhood where people live regularly."
When it comes to churches, then it is concerned that money from the sale of property will not last as long as church leaders think and " sooner or later it will be found at the beginning."
He added that the churches could replace residential buildings with apartments where they would live people who wouldn't help the rest of the churches in the neighborhood.
"Many people who buy apartments in these buildings will be whiters," he said, "that is why you will be faster to come the day when those churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that the residents who settled in these apartments will become members of those churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original white Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The black congregation that maintained a nearby temple took possession of the building.
The church of St. Martin took over a black congregation with St. John Howard Johnson on the head, who led a boycott of merchants on a little 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed the employment or promotion of blacks.
The 1939 fire seriously damaged the building, but since the parishioners of the Reverend Johnson planned its reconstruction, they ordered a series of bells, called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of the father Johnson and successor of St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "the bells of poor people".
The expert who played the carillon in July used a second term: "cultural goods" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, pointed out that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by the black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who has been playing for 18 years at the larger carillon in the Church of Riverside.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What is being played in St. Martin over the past few months is a story of architects and performers of construction works, some of which have been brought by laymen to the churches, and others of the episcopal diocese.
Sacristija, the executive body of the county, wrote to the children in July because of the concern that the child will "endure to transfer expenses" to the Sacristi, although it was not included in the involvement of architects and construction workers who sent the child.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the child.
Marine dog injured 13-year-olds during diving for lobsters in California
According to official reports, the marine dog attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while running after a lobster in California on the day of opening the hunting season on the lobsters.
The attack took place some time before 7 a.m. near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the station of the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he ran with friends about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call for help, and then led the group to the attack site to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought it was an excitement because of a caught lobster, but then he realized that he was shouting, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire key bone was broken.
"I hesitated to get everyone out of the water: "There's a sea dog in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transferred by helicopter to the child hospital of the Council in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of marine dog responsible for the attack is unknown.
The captain of the rescue team Larry Giles said at a press conference that the marine dog was seen in that area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous species of marine dog.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma at the top of the body.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto in Casablanca to Swamia in Ecinitas for investigation and security of the buyer.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in that area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans for entry into the UK’s beauty market
Sainsbury’s became a competition for chains such as Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic plates in the style of factory houses and by engaging specialized sellers.
As part of a major entry into the UK's beauty market worth GBP 2.8 billion, which continues to grow compared to the drop in sales on the market of clothing and household equipment, larger cosmetic plates will be tested in 11 stores across the country and expanded to additional stores next year if shown to successful ones.
Investment in cosmetic products is one of the ways that supermarkets try to use space on police that was once intended for televisions, microwaves and home equipment.
Sainsbury’s representatives said they would double the offer of cosmetic products to 3,000 products, including the first time and trade marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And existing assortment companies L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space with areas for certain trade brands like Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch its assortment of decorative cosmetics Boutique, so most products will be suitable for vegans, which is what younger buyers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, a fragrance dealer Fragrance Shop will try to use concessions in two Sainsbury’s shops, the first one opened last week in Croydon in southern London and the second one opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Net purchases and return to daily purchases of small quantities of food in local food stores mean that supermarkets need to try more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury, said that the outlying would look more and more like a factory house while that supermarket chain is trying to resist favourable trades such as Aldi and Lidl offering a larger number of services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced outlet Argos in hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitats units because he bought both chains two years ago, which has prompted him to sell vital supplies and made these acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt to refresh its cosmetic and pharmaceutical products has not been successful.
Sainsbury’s entered into a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but it ended up fighting about sharing the revenues of the drug in its supermarkets.
The new strategy followed after Sainsbury’s three years ago, GBP 125 million sold its pharmaceutical business in the 281 store of Celesiu, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
He claims that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by classifying in four shops an assortment of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's said: "We have changed the appearance and perception of our departments with cosmetic products in order to provide our users with a more comfortable environment.
We also put in special training a colleague who will be at the disposal of the buyers and give them advice.
Our assortment of trade marks is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and the available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for buying cosmetic products, which will lead to changes in old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "excited" after Holly Willoughby gave up a contract worth 11 million pounds.
Dragon’s Day Peter Jones's star was left to "cook of anger" after TV leader Holly Willoughby gave up 11 million pounds of contract with his trade mark to focus on his new contracts with the Marks & Spencer and ITV chain
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of household clothes and fashion supplements Truly.
Their trade mark is compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow trade mark.
This Morning (37) show's head on Instagram announced he's leaving.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragon’s Day show star to cook out of anger by retreating from a joint profitable job last minute to focus on her own new great contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources claim that Jones was "angrily" when a golden girl on TV during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business kingdom in Marlowa in Buckinghamshire admitted that her new contracts were worth up to 1.5 million pounds means that there is no longer time to devote themselves to their trade brand of household clothes and fashion supplements Truly.
This job was compared to Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's trade mark and was supposed to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that he was leaving True, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was one of the greatest Holly priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term investment in the future that would ensure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw has affected everything involved in that job.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so near the start of the whole line.
In Marlow's headquarters, there's a lot of stuff that's ready to sell."
Experts believe that due to the departure of the issue leader This Morning, one of the stars in Britain in which it is most profitable to invest, the company could suffer millions of losses due to the large funds invested in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothing and the possible additional delaying of the line.
And that could mean the end of a long - term friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were ten years close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded True with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined them as president of the administration in March.
Couples spend vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an M&S trade mark ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the leader of the I’m a celebrity show.
The source close to Jones last night said, "We do not want to comment on his business activities."
Hard talks, and then we fell in love
He complained about the criticism he would get in the newspapers because of comments that some might consider to be "suffering the president" and because he has such a positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give so many concessions?"
he said Trump, reflecting the voice of the news leader.
"I didn't give any concessions."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have been suspended.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore on Saturday, the chief diplomat of North Korea Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the north did not notice the "responsive" US response to North Korea's disarmament activities.
He noted that instead of that, the United States has not yet abolished sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were threatened by a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be lost.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kimo had positive results – interrupting the pilot launch of the missile, helping to free hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to act as president, but instead of waiting in front of this full arena for 10,000 people, we'd have about 200 people there," Trump said, pointing to a bunch of people right in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, a national disaster has not been declared, which is a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear about not seeking international help, so it was a little problematic," said Mrs. Sumbun.
Although the Save the Children is a team that will travel to Pala, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disasters Office, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu in order to see whether international agencies would be allowed to participate in aid efforts.
In view of the continuing ground support in Indonesia, this country is still sadly unprepared to bear the wrath of nature.
Although shelters in the case of tsunamis are built in Aceh, it is not something that is usual on other parts of the coastline.
The absence of siren for warnings on the tsunamis in Palu, although the warning was in force, was likely to result in a loss of life.
And in the best time, traveling between many Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
The hospital ship that was anchored in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake was on its way to Pala, but it takes at least three days to reach the scene of a new disaster.
The improvement of the Indonesian decayed structure was the foundation of the election campaign of President Yoko Widodo and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the government under Yoko fights the lack of financial resources, and next year new elections are held.
Joko is also faced with the pressure of remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs were fighting on the streets with swords, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Player Liverpool Daniel Sturridge scored a match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday from the defeat of the Premier League against Chelsea in 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shakiri while he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal at the result of 1:0 for Chelsea.
He moved the ball on his left leg before he shot her to the opposite stop.
The ball flew high above naked towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally ran away from Kepay Arrizabalaga, which jumped towards her and entered the network.
"It was necessary to get into that position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com
"I've seen Kante come and I've only once touched the ball. I didn't think too much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea led in half-time with a 1:0 after meeting the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The blue attacker passed the ball back to Mateu Kovacic during that game before he turned somewhere in half the field and ran into Liverpool's half.
The Kovacic did a quick addition in the middle of the field.
Then he directed a beautiful pass ball that had led Hazard to the goal.
Hazard surrounded the defense and hit the ball with his left leg in a network on the opposite stop next to the Silverpool of Alison Becker.
Liverpool plays a club match against Naples in the League of Champions at 3pm on Wednesday at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea awaits Videoton at the UEFA European League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths in Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, the State Disaster Office reported on Sunday morning.
The agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference that a large number of people were reported to have been trapped in the ruins of the building after the earthquake of 7.5 that felt on Friday and caused waves of heights up to 6 meters.
The city of Pala, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is full of the remains of fallen buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) for suspicion of murder after the woman was killed.
The murder investigation was launched after a female body found in Birkenhead this morning in Merseyside.
A 44-year-old was found at 07:55 with stab wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old was arrested for suspected murder.
The police called on people from that area to report if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still in progress, but I would like to see all of us who were near John’s Street in Birkenhead, and they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is of key importance to our investigation."
Police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found in Birkenhead was found and that she was found in the building.
This afternoon at the scene came friends who thought they knew that woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation was ongoing, and the police said it was in the course and the procedure for informing the nearest victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives on Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the cops told him that no one can enter or get out of the building.
He ran out of words when he found out what happened.
The residents are now told that it will take a few hours until they can return to their homes.
A cop allegedly told someone that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman showed up at a crime scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "That's so terrible."
At 14:00 in the fenced area, there were two police vans, and another one was parked directly outside.
A large number of police officers stood inside the fenced area and monitored the housing block.
All those who have any information are requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, named 101 or to be anonymously organised by Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, calling on record 247 of 30 September.
Kip Cromwell in Parliament is the newest monument that took place in the middle of a debate on "the end of history"
His pursuit would be poetic justice for almost the Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts that his fanatic Puritan followers performed.
But Cromwell's society called Mr. Crick's attempt to "mock" and "trying to break history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Society, said: “In the debate currently being held on the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of the Westminster Palace became the subject of debate.
The iconoclass of the English Civil Wars isn't something Cromwell ordered or did.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the procedures of his ancestor Thomas in the past century.
The wonderful revitalization of Cromwell Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the way of thinking of the 19th century and part of the history of the person for which many still consider it to be worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century rather than today, a defender of parliament from outside pressure. Of course, in his case it was the pressure of the monarchy.
Is that a completely credible opinion the subject is a historical debate that continues.
What is certain is that a conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique recognizable figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements in the role of the Lord of Protectors are still worth the tributes and markings."
The pig killed by a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, the pig attacked and killed a farmer on the market in southwestern China.
A man mentioned only by the name of "Yuan" was found dead cut off arteries and blood covered nearby is standing on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, published the South China Morning Letter on Sunday.
Pig breeder was about to be vaccinated by pigs in a pig in the Chinese province of Qinghai on 30 May 2005.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the stable with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that a pig weighed 250 kilos [250 kilos] of the breeder to death.
The evening news of Guiyang indicates that a relative named "Wu" said, "My cousin's legs were bleeding and suffocated."
The security camera footage showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager said for the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on someone else while the police are collecting evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market manager are allegedly negotiating a fee for his death.
Although this rarely occurs, the attacks of pigs on humans have already been recorded.
In 2016, the pig attacked her wife and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kilograms drew a large farmer along with a tractor until his wife opened up the animal.
After the pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "a trigger".
"They're just played.
They're grinning, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect," he said.
The rest of Rosa's hurricane brings strong rains to the southwest of the United States
As announced, Hurricane Rosa is weak as it passes over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But during the next few days, Rosa will bring flooding rains in the area of North Mexico and the South West of the United States.
Rosa breathed at 05:00 east time at 140 km/h, making it hurricane category 1, and was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, above the Pacific, it creates a low pressure area and moves towards the Western coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California in the form of a tropical storm, starting to push a deep layer of tropical moisture towards the north towards the Southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture in the interaction with the approaching low pressure area will cause the formation of strong waves in much of the southwest.
In the local areas 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous storms, mud storms and possible precipitation in the desert.
The deep layer of tropical moisture will cause the formation of a dam of approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Even 25 to 100 mm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
The rapid deterioration of conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rain is possible.
There's no advice to go to the desert of the pedestrian due to the danger of tropical reefs.
Heavy rain could turn the canyons into wild rivers, and thunderstorms would bring local storm winds and dusty gusts.
Nearing the low pressure area will bring local strong rains on the parts of the southern coast of California.
It is possible to cause a volume greater than 12 mm, which may result in less muddled bulging and slippery roads.
It's going to be the first wet season in this region.
The scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the late evening and Monday morning before the end of Monday and Tuesday cover the wider area.
A strong rain will spread on Tuesday in the area where the borders of the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah are touched all day long on Wednesday.
In October, large temperature changes across the U.S. are possible as the Arctic cools, but tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes in small distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the Central US.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omahe in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days the remaining summer heat will continue to grow and expand again.
It is expected that most of the Central and Eastern US will start in October from 27 degrees south-east to parts of the north-east.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast points to a great possibility of higher temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks testifying hard on candidates for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly occurring in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political account continued, and the reporters interrupted the regular programme to report a reversion on the last moment of Friday: an agreement reached by Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate court board that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had touched her in a drunken state and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a burning witness that he was absolutely sure it didn't happen.
Friday's hearing was probably followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number mentioned in Nielsen's report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers for other networks was not immediately available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen is usually in trouble with measuring the number of people looking at the contents of the offices.
In order to reach you better, it's about the audience that's a number similar to the one who's looking at playing American football or the Oscar division.
Fox News Channel, whose guests in the study strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the largest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day's hearing, reported from Nielsen.
ABC took another place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained great and after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the office of that moderate Republican issued a warning that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, they recorded on him shouting demonstrators while trying to go to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
A few minutes ago, he stood face-to-face watching him live in front of CNN's cameras.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he is telling the truth in this country?"
They said to him, "You have power while so many women are helpless."
Flake said that his office had issued a notice even before the elevator door closed that he would say more at the committee hearing.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks followed live when the Judicial Committee had to vote on the direction of the Kawanaugh nomination to vote throughout the Senate.
But Flake said that he would do it only on condition that the FBI investigates charges against candidates during the next week, which required democracy that is in the minority.
Flakea was partly convinced of talks with a friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then a few more senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve the Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI's investigation of charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of playing politics with Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plan to leave the European Union to "play politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermine national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham in the United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, continued to criticise her so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit in the same interview with her, saying it was proposed that the United Kingdom and the EU should charge each other with "full nonsense".
The murder of Waydea Sims: police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspected of LSU player's death
Police arrested a murder suspect with the firearms of Waydea Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Ditheon Simpson (20) was arrested and detained under arrest for murder in custody, Baton Rouge's police department reported.
Officials posted a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses in the conflict.
Police found eyeglasses at the crime scene and reported finding Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB, CBS branch reported.
After the Simpson police investigation, he confessed to shooting Wayde and killed him.
It's a $350,000 security claim.
On Friday, the bodyguard of the municipality of East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a blighted head wound through the neck.
The police administration thanks the working group for the fugitives of the federal police force Louisiana, the criminal police lab of the federal state, the South University police and the citizens of the area for assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local authorities for implementing the law on "the endurance and search for the truth."
Sims was 20 years old.
An 183 cm high wing player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
On average, he had 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps in the game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "depressed" and "in shock" because of Wade's death.
"That's what we always worry about," Wade said.
Volcano threw ash into Mexico City
The ashes that expels the volcano Popocatapetl reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The national disaster prevention centre on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased activity in the crater and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The center was followed by multiple squeezing and squeezing.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ashes on windshields of cars in Mexico City’s neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital since the earthquake of magnitude 7.1 shook central Mexico in 2017.
Volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
The conflict between police and Catalan separatists meets an annual vote on independence
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrators defending independence clashed with the intervention police and thousands of people joined protest demonstrations to mark a Catalan polarizing vote on the expulsion.
A group of masked separatists, who were acquitted by the intervention police, began to throw out policemen with eggs and paint in dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded by tourists.
The fights broke out later the day the police used sticks to calm the fight.
During a few hours of the group that advocated independence, they scandalized "No forgetfulness, No Forgiveness", and the unionists opposed them to shouting "Long Life Spain".
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital because of the easier injuries caused during the demonstration, local press reported.
The tensions in the region that weighs on independence have not reached a year after the referendum of October 1st, which Madrid declared to be illegal, and which the Catalan separatists celebrate.
Most voters decided on independence, although the exit was small, because those who opposed the vaccination were mostly boycotting the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in severe conflicts last year after the police tried to stop voting in polls across the region.
Groups that advocate independence spent Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but the demonstrators were forced to take the second route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who attended separatist demonstrations along with his wife, said he no longer hoped that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of the best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness that they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite their key achievement, although a significant victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties for independence are hard to maintain this year because their most well-known leaders are in a self-appointed exile or in detention awaiting trial because of their role in organising referendums and subsequent declarations of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict had prompted politicians both sides.
"The situation is getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders, announced to the investigation prison since the end of last year that they would run for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"The candidacy for European elections is the best way we can recognise the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: arrested men after car hit in the house
Three men from 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after they hit the London Derry house several times.
The incident occurred Thursday at around 19.30 BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the yard doors and the building itself were damaged.
It's possible that at some point on the car there's an arrow fired from a single shot.
Hit Menge brought Livingstone to victory over the Rangers with the result 1:0
First goal Dolly Menge for Livingstone brought victory
The new Scottish Premiership League League was surprised by the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to admit his only second defeat of the eighteenth-end Ibrox stadium club at the head of the club.
The Dolly Menge shot turned out to be a decisive one while Gary Holt's team was in a second dealing with the Iberian.
Gerrard's team is still unbeatable in the guesthouse of the Premiership this season, and the next Saturday they play against Hearts, the leading club in the league behind which eight points are behind.
Earlier, Rangers in the European League will host the Rapid Vienna Club on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone has been increasing its six-game series of victories, and Chief Coach Holt has not yet experienced a defeat since Kenny Miller was replaced last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against dead guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead before they got that shot, given that their directness in the attack caused a whole series of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but there was a traffic on the way to the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only point the ball wide after he cleaned up to intercept the blow of Craig Halket's head to the goal.
Hosts were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble to guests
And that's exactly how the key goal was achieved.
The Rangers missed to stop the free strike, and Livingston came up with an opening, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson were together assisting Mengi who hit in the middle of the goal.
Until then, Rangers had most control over the ball, but they faced an untested home defense, so the goalman Liam Kelly was mostly out of business.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the strike.
The legs of the Golman Rangers Allan McGregor have apologised to Scott Pittman, and Lithgov has led a wide-ranging blow from another organised attack in Livingstone.
Long add-on failed to cross the liveston goal line, and were not awarded two one-star – after Halket's conflict with the replacement player Glen Middleton and one to play by hand.
"Great" by Livingstone – analysis
Alasdar Lamont from Scottish BBC in Arena Tony Macaroni
Excellent game and result of Livingstone.
All up to one was excellent, which they continued to surpass expectations on that entry path.
Their style of games and staff barely changed since their return to the big clubs, but the big credit goes to Holt and the way he united the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant at the head of an excellently organized defense, and Menga did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worral to have an early one during the game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from standards that set a good game under Gerard.
They couldn't get the ball to the end, just once they opened a hole in the home team, and that's their special call to market for Rangers in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan awaited with mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) everything was a lot of smiles under the bright sky when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan Germany – whose goal is to repair the relationship between NATO allies.
They were divided into opinions on issues involving human rights, freedom of print and access to Turkey's EU.
Erdogan then headed to Koeln to open a huge new mosque.
In that city, the largest Turkish population lives outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police blocked the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but a large number of presidents who came to see him appeared nearby.
And hundreds of protestors against Erdogan — a large number of Kurdas — raised their voices in condemning Erdogan's policy and the decisions of the German government to welcome him to the country.
Conflict demonstrations reflect the division caused by a visitor some German Turks celebrate as heroes, and others attack as autocrats.
Road crash in Deptford: a biker died in a car crash
The biker died in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Beswod and Evelyn Street, on the road with dense traffic in Deptford in the southeast of the city about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man passed by on the spot.
The crash took place a few months after the death of another biker after the crash and the escape of the driver from an accident site on the Chiders Street, about a mile and a half of a Saturday crash site.
City police have reported that police officers are trying to identify a man and inform his closest relative.
Because of the accident, roads are closed and bus traffic is redirected, and motor vehicle drivers are recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: six police officers injured in riots
Prison officials reported that six police officers were injured in a man-in-man prison in prison of a closed type.
The riots broke out in Long Martin prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and still persist.
The special "Tornado" units were brought in to reduce the disturbances that include eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
Police officers on their faces are provided with help for minor facial injuries.
A spokesperson for the prison department said: “The prison personnel were specially trained to resolve the incident during the Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members received assistance due to the injury.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and we want to make it clear that everyone responsible will be handed over to the police and that we can spend a long time behind bars."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison manager ended up in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the intervention police were called to prison to resolve a serious situation in which staff were attacked by billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with tropical floods (possible benefit for dry areas)
It is rare for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but there is a likelihood that this will happen just at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa gets the rest of her power across the Southwest of the Desert and poses a threat to the stormy floods.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued warnings about the rainstorms on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona, through south and east Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should get close to Phoenix late Monday with the rain and cross right through it on Tuesday.
In his tweet, the National Hydrometeorological Service in Phoenix reported that “only ten tropical cyclones since 1950 brought a tropical storm or depression about 320 miles [320 km] from Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from Arizona border."
The latest model of the National Hurricane Centre provides 50 to 100 mm of drilling, with isolated quantities up to 150 mm on the Mogollonian edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the Southwest, including Stinjak and the Great Basin, there is a probability of a range of 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated total quantities up to 100 mm.
For those beyond the danger of the devastating floods of Rosa, it could come as a rescue because the region is hit by drought.
Although floods are a major threat, part of these dams could be useful because in the southwest the current drought government is.
"According to the American drought map, less than 40 percent of Arizona was hit by at least extreme drought, another highest category," weather.com said
The journey of the hurricane first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the maximum wind speed of 130 km per hour and was 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moved north at 20 km per hour.
The storm hit the colder waters of the Pacific, so it weakened you.
Therefore, it is expected that Monday afternoon or evening the coast of Mexico will be approached by a tropical storm.
The rain in parts of Mexico could be strong and represent a significant danger from the emergence of the flood.
"The number of total volumes expected in the area from the Baja California peninsula to the northwest of Sonore is from 75 to 150 mm, which can be up to 250 mm", weather.com said.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and south Utah by Tuesday late in the evening.
"The main danger expected of Rose or its remains is very strong rains on the peninsula of Baja California, the north of Sonora and the American South West," they reported from the National Hurricane Centre.
These rains are expected to result in life - threatening storms and storms of mud in the deserts and glaciers in the mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-olds were arrested for suspecting attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
About 04.00 BST on Saturday in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton was found injured teenager.
He's taken to the hospital and stable.
The Avona and Somerseta police department reported that 17-year-olds, 2 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
Police officers have called for all those who have a video of events to appear.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh suffered the evil and anger of the Democratic Party.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugha is a vote to reject the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a pre-election assembly in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the anger and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanauh testified on Thursday before Congress and resolutely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's charges for sexual assault decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified to the prosecution she filed.
The president said on Saturday that day "the American people saw the brilliantness, quality and courage" of Kavanaugha.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's vote is to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an outstanding career in public service," he said to the assembled accessions in West Virginia.
The president touched Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of the Republican's election in half of the presidential mandate.
"For five weeks we are divided by one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but actually I am," he said.
That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump stated that a democratic mission was "to create resistance and obstructions".
The Republican leadership assistant said to CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Cavanaugh Nomination Senate is expected to take place on Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis, and the number continues to rise
The authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, a large number of them pulled off the huge waves that struck the coast when the great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Paul on Friday, when the waves of heights up to six meters in the summer hit the coast, dragging many of them to death and breaking everything on their way.
Cunami followed after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When there was a danger of tsunami yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately and were killed," Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the Indonesian agency to mitigate the consequences of the BNPB disaster at a press conference in Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he was pulling cars, fats, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said and added that the tsunami crossed the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
"Some people were climbing trees to escape tsunamis and survive," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated at 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, ruined and destroyed bridges and the mosque surrounded by water.
The subsequent strikes continued to punish that coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) announced in its statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday corresponded to the two-fold power of nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It states that the geographical location of the city at the end of the long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the building and added that 540 people were injured, and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroh’s words, the number of victims and damage may be greater than 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Dongal and closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communications are completely interrupted and we don't have information from Dongal."
"More than 300,000 people live in this area," says the report of the Red Cross, which adds that staff and volunteers have moved to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get worse," the statement states.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism because of the lack of information that the tsunami hit Pala, although officials claim the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social networks, it can be heard that a man on the top floor of the building panics people down the street about the coming tsunami.
Within a few minutes the water wall fell onto the shore, carrying with it buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency was unable to verify the authenticity of the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused the disappearance of the electricity that caused the interruption of communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue action.
According to the authorities, it began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but food and other necessary supplies were still needed to be evacuated.
The City Airport is reopened only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed by October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia has taken more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"Although World Vision staff from Dongale have successfully arrived in the city of Pala, where the employees have moved to the inter-administrative tents set up in the courtyard of their office, they have followed the scenes of destruction on the way," said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched wheels to help disaster, some have claimed that foreign humanitarians with great expertise are incapacitated to the arrival of Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, the financing, supply and employment of staff from other countries can only begin if the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says, 'All right, it's a national disaster, we can receive international aid, but such a situation has not yet been declared."
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunami fell in Pala, friends and families of those still considered to be missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that mitigate the black scenarios of natural disasters.
The boy was rescued from the sewer on Saturday.
On Saturday, the rescuers released a woman who had been imprisoned for two days under the ruins near her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandano, a coach of the Indonesian state paraglider team, trained two missing paragliders for Asian games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those prisoners at Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagija, were his students.
"In view of the many years spent in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled that after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, which spread to the paragloider community, whatsApp messages to competitors from Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
But his messages are still marked with a gray hook instead of two blue hooks.
"I think that means that messages have not been delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26,750 while filling the ATMs in the center of Newport on the Levee
The thieves stole 26.750 U.S. dollars on Friday morning from Brink's employee who filled the ATM at the center of Newport on the Levee, reports the Newport police press.
Detective Dennis McCarthy says that the car driver emptied the ATM in a fun complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy with this, the other man "has come to Brin's employee's back in the race" and stole a bag of money that he was supposed to put in a ATM.
The Witnesses noticed more suspicious people fleeing the scene, but the police did not indicate the number of people involved in the incident.
All who have any information about their identity should contact the Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper rename in Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change the name in Ye.
In a Saturday post on Twitter that announced this change, he wrote: "Life will be officially known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used it as the title of his eight album published in June.
The change comes in front of his guests at the Saturday Night Live show, which is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
The show's authors said that the show replaced the singer Arian Grande who canceled for "emotional reasons".
Except that it's the shortness of his current artistic name, West has previously said that this word has religious significance for him.
“I think “ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you”,” West said earlier this year in a conversation about the title of his album with the radio leader Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's me, it's us.
It came from Kanye, which means "one", in Ye alone – a reflection of good, bad, confused, all in us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are."
He's one of the famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
And the former West's co-worker, JAY-Z, was playing with versions of his name without a drawing and with a drawing written in big letters.
Mexican AMLO promised he wouldn't use the army against citizens
A candidate for Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised he would never use military force against citizens while the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of revenge on students.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday at the Tlatelolco market promised that "he will never use the army against the Mexican people."
Military forces fired during peaceful demonstrations in that market on October 2, 1968, and killed even 300 people at the time the left-wing student movements began to spread to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador was committed to supporting young Mexicans by giving monthly support to those studying and opening a larger number of free public universities.
He said that the unemployment and lack of education appeal to young criminal gangs.
US should double investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
"Since China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount that it invests in research in that area," the investor in artificial intelligence and expert in the area Kai Fu Leee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
This comment followed after various parts of the US government announced plans on artificial intelligence, although the US is basically missing a formal strategy on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the first country by 2030, by the number of AI innovations.
"Two-fold increase in the research budget in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US and that we are looking for the next great discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"Two-fold increase in investment could double the chances that up to the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will come to the US," Lee said this week in a conversation with CNBC.
Lee, whose book: "Ai velvet: China, Silicone Valley and a new world order", published this month by the publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, one of the most successful AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the best American player of the game Othello, and later he was director of Microsoft's Research Department and president of the Google China border.
Lee praised the previous American government's technological competitions, such as Defence Advanced Research Projects, Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
"It's not China that leads academic leaders, it's corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have engaged the brightest minds from the university to work on researching artificial intelligence over the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to stimulate its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think doctors in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically offer green cards," he said.
The Chinese State Council announced the next generation's artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
"The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation provides financial resources to persons in academic institutions as the National Science Foundation and other state organisations provide financial resources to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Ministry of Defence founded the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include partners from the activities and the academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced investment in $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to NSF, he currently invests more than $100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, the US legislation that wanted to establish the National Security Commission on artificial intelligence does not do anything for months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on changing their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted on Saturday at the referendum on whether they want to change their country's name to "the Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that could resolve the dispute with Greece that has been going on for decades and which has blocked Greece from opening negotiations for accession to the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia and Greece claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents the occupation of its territory and has put veto on the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
Two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign for boycotting the vote cast doubt as to whether the exit would meet the minimum 50 per cent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU with the acceptance of an agreement with Greece?"
Applicants for the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that it is a price worth paying to Macedonia, one of the countries that occurred after the collapse of Yugoslavia, enabled access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians to live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, members of parliament have said enough that they will respect it to be considered decisive.
The change of names requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Authority stated that no irregularities were reported within 13 hours.
However, output was only 16%, compared with 34% during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voicer from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško, joined the referendum on the country's change of name in Strumica on 30 September 2018, opening the way for NATO joining the Union and the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov in front of parliament in Skopje set a small stage and framed chairs in front of tents set up by those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join raised heads, not as servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring so much needed investment to Macedonia, a country where unemployment exceeds 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will support the referendum, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the "positive" result would be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43% of voters will join the referendum, which is below the necessary response.
The second poll conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV showed that 57 per cent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they'd support the referendum.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the output must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the Western government since it took over its mandate in May last year.
See: Player Manchester City Sergio Aguero goes through the entire Briggton defense to achieve a hit
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester in England experienced Brighton's defense and brought the Manchester City to victory with the result of 2 : 0.
Aguero made the victory crazy simply, reaching a hit in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received an addition in the middle of the field at the beginning of the attack.
He broke through three Brighton's defenses and then reached the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four opponents in green shirts.
He walked around one of the defendants, and then he passed them a few more on the edge of Brighton's space.
That's when he added the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The first attempt was made by an English attacker to return the ball to Aguere, who threw the right-hand ball into the network and defeated Brighton's doorman Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some foot-and-step difficulties," reporters reported manager Manchester City, Pep Guardiola.
"We planned to play which 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he made a hit at that point."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage of the Prime Minister League.
That shot was achieved in 29 minutes.
Aguero got deep into Brighton's field during that game.
Beautifully added the ball to Leroy Sane along the left-hand side.
Sane pushed the ball several times before directing Sterling to the station.
The Sky Blues attacker put the ball in the net just before he hit the car.
Manchester City fights Hoffenheim in the team game League champions on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to disable Rockies' progress
Since Nationals' players were eliminated from playing, there were not too many reasons to insist on a new start.
But always competitively equipped Scherzer hopes for Sunday's victory against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies, who have the advantage of one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, get into play.
Rockies on Friday night with a 5 : 2 win over Nationals at least secured a place in wild card play, but still hope to win their first title.
"Although we're playing for nothing, we can at least throw out the atmosphere here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I'd be witnessing this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
Nationals still have to publish a Sunday launcher, but they're supposed to be willing to offer Scherzer to play in that case.
Scherzer, who's going to make his 34th start, got warmed up in the dumpster space on Thursday and played on Sunday, when he usually rests.
The Washington right-hand side this season achieved a score of 18 : 7, average of winning races (ERA) of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds changes.
Tromp on the set in West Virginia
During his speech on the importance of the outcome of the Republican voters in general elections, the president commented on his election as Judge of the Supreme Court.
"Everything we've done will be at a trial in the cold.
It's still five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the big, big – I didn't run, but I'm actually running, and that's why I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continues: “You see this terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
Their intention is to take power again in any way; you see wickedness, corruption.
They don't care who needs to hurt, who need to be overrun to take over power and control; so they want power and control; we will not give them any.
Democrats say they have a mission "to resist and to disturb".
"You've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "enraged, evil, corrupt and false".
He addressed the democratic Senator Diane Feinstein of the Justice Committee of the Senate by name, which caused the public's loud contempt.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leave the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document – it was really a bad body speech, the worst body speech I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer imports different opinions.
Not tolerating personal preferences
It didn't surprise me when Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
Finally, I am the last in a series of representatives of the Labour Party who were told that they were not welcome – and all because we said what was in our minds.
According to my colleague Joan Ryan, they did the same because they strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby in the censorship proposal.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy Corbyn did not agree with the previous leadership.
The announcement of a meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party's border on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years during which I work as a local representative of the Labour Party's meeting of the General Council on Friday night were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today many meetings take place in a different tone, and the promise of a "loving, gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the foreign leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, since the collaborators I thought to share similar political views from me began to require drastic change of opinion and taking up positions that I would never agree with – whether it was national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – follow up on the rumors of offensive words on social networks calling for my objection, to which the policy of the centre is rejected, and to which I am instructed that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know I've had more luck than some of my colleagues because they're comments that are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face every day a wave of sexist or racist comments, but they never stop.
One of the aspects of this political era that disappointed me most is the tolerance of insulting speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with any proposal for non-confidential or changing electoral rules, we are becoming an ever-increasing party.
They've advised me many times in the last two years to raise my head, not to be so loud and tell me that then everything will be all right."
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, encouraged by the neglect of the Margaret Thatcher government, which left my school multi-purpose student to fail, I wanted to provide better public services for those who needed them most – either as a local councillor or a minister in the government.
I've never been hiding my policy, nor in the last election.
No one within the Nottingham East could have been misled about my political positions and areas of conflict with current leadership.
All I would order to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country grabs against Brexit, which will negatively reflect on households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to lose time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But actually the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my election units, whether it's about the members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of opposition or political benefit will distract me from acting as I consider it to be in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 Unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late attempts may have influenced some of the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting game of days at the Tennant's Premiership League.
Now they've reached the top of the ladder and they're the only unbeatable of ten teams.
Finally, the top defense and better use of the opportunity led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
"So far we have been tried at every game and we are still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose Club said: "Every honour to Ayra, they took advantage of opportunities better than us."
The trial of Grant Anderson in 14 minutes by Frazier Climo led Ayr, but the yellow card for the Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was excluded from the game by the Warriors, enabled Melrose to raise the results, and Jason Baggot used an unrealized attempt.
Climo increased Ayra's leadership to one-aester before, at the same half-time, he achieved a hit and made an independent attempt to change the result for Ayr at 17:5 in the sight of the strike.
But the second half of Melrose started well and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, who realized Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
At that time there was a long break due to the serious accident of Ruarid Knott, which they carried on the carriages, and when the game continued, Ayr continued a good game by trying Stafford McDowall, who realized Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then got yellow cardboard and Melrose again made an additional player pay, and this unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card to destroy Clima who didn't have a ball; with the line for a penalty blow, MacPherson made a landing behind Ayra in a full swing of passage.
Climo realized how he did it almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe received a high blow from David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's side player to the fifth attempt of domestic teams.
The Still Game series star appears ready for a new career in restaurant activity
Ford Kiernan, the star of the Still Game series, appears ready to continue working in the service activities after it has been discovered that it is appointed by the director of the company of licensed restaurants.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a favorite BBC series with a screenwriter and one of the stars, along with a longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last one to show up, and Kiernan seems to plan to dedicate his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is the director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although one source for the Scottish Sun insisted that Kiernan would like to be involved in "the growing restaurant activity in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, who has no exit to the sea, hopes that the court will assign her exit to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling the seabed with a full-fledged elevator in La Paz.
A flag of ocean color has been reported on public buildings.
Sea basses from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon or cryati: “We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to bring it back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, the memory of the lost seashore in favour of Chile during the 19th century's conflict with resources is still alive – just as the desire for the re-sealing of the Pacific.
While Bolivia is awaiting the judgement of the International Court of Justice expected on 1 October, after a five-year trial, and hopes may be at the highest level in the last few decades.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, optimistically awaits the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A multitude of Bolivians across the country will look at the judgement of the International Court of Justice on large screens and hope that the Hague court will decide in favour of Bolivia's position that Chile, after several decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate on the accession of the sovereign exit to the Bolivian sea.
Here's Morales, a Bolivian charismatic president who faces a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, can also benefit from the verdict on Monday.
"We are the result of the return of the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will judge for Bolivia and that it would change a little if it did.
The UN body with its seat in the Netherlands has no authority to assign Chilean territory and said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgement of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after final hearings means that the case "was not complex," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interest, they may have been delayed for the last four years.
"The question of access to the sea has now been adopted by the Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' wartime rhetoric buried every good will of Chile, he thinks.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at once, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
Those two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court made a decision unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an unprecedented opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "stop 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used a maritime question as a political stick.
"Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea said it wouldn't come to nuclear disarmament if she couldn't trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be nuclearly disarmed if he couldn't trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep promises of the day during the meeting of the leaders of these two opposing countries in Singapore.
He commented at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed inclined to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that the sanctions have continued due to "lost imagination" and that opposition to the U.S. declaration on the end of the Korean war will not cast the North on its knees.
Washington is not willing to support the declaration without Pjonggang taking concrete steps first.
Kim and U.S. president Donald Trump want to hold another summit meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism about the serious intention of Pyongyang to renounce the arsenals that this country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongang next month to prepare for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
Paris' fashion magazines reveal that the last line of big ones covered the head on the road to luxury trade in your neighborhood
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or completely protect the sun, do not search further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne in fashion presented a line of naked golems covering their head for their spring and summer 2019 collection and enjoyed lovers of style in Paris's fashion week.
Extremely impractical hats this summer passed Instagram, and these designers sent their creations that attract the attention of the track.
The example that came to mind was Valentino, and it was about a big bean hat decorated with a wide-ranging look like feathers that completely "takes" the head of the model.
The other glamorous supplements included pasta decorated with jewelry, magic hats, and even pineapple, but these supplements are not meant to warm your head.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – right on time for Halloween.
Many hairy masks had smooth lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion pieces.
One creation was like a diving suit with a trigger and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with a melted ice cream.
If you follow the great fashion phrase – happiness is on your side.
The stylists predict that huge hats could come into luxury stores in your neighborhood.
The huge hats are perfectly suited to the "La Bomba", a broken hat with a width of about 60 cm, which is seen on many famous and famous people, from Rihanne to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult trade mark behind the extremely impractical hat that has subjected social networks to the fashion track has sent another great creation – a broken beach bag almost as much as a maneken in the bathroom costume she was wearing.
Rusty orange bag of raffia, decorated with rafia resins and white leather lunch, was an exhibition example in the summer collection Jacquemus' La Riviera for 2019 in Paris's week fashion.
Stylist of famous and famous, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags in luxury shops next year. Since the designer left such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for big fashion supplements."
John Edward: Language skills the citizens of the world need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of outstanding results exams, giving added weight to this unique and common success in sport, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students all over Scotland, this school representing the Scottish Independent School Council (SCIS) is trying to provide the best level of service to its students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, a career they want and make them for the citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement that school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be the favorite and desired object chosen in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.
If you speak his mother tongue, it goes into his heart."
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot use English only if we want to build trust and relations with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's final exams show that the most evaluations in languages have been carried out by school graduates of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students learning foreign languages received excellent grades.
The data collected in 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received an excellent score for Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students, and 63% of Spanish students also received the highest possible score.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Today, languages as elective objects are considered as important as STEM objects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as well as elsewhere.
The survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 revealed that 17% of employers cannot fill jobs due to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative for the preparation of young people for careers.
Since more and more jobs are looking for language knowledge, skills are key in a globalized world.
Regardless of the choice of careers, people who have learned to speak foreign languages in the future will feel the benefits of such long-term skills.
A person who speaks more languages can communicate directly with strangers, which gives him an advantage over competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouTube in 2013 involving more than 4,000 adults, 75% of subjects in the United Kingdom do not know the foreign language well enough to be able to communicate on it, and French is the only language that speaks a bilateral percentage of subjects, more precisely 15%.
So investing in language learning is very important for today’s children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good employment.
Every school in Scotland offers a variety of languages.
Some schools in their programme will classify classical, modern languages, while others will decide on languages that are considered to be the most important in the United Kingdom 2020, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, in independent schools you will always have a variety of choices, as well as teaching staff who are expert in this area.
Scottish independent schools provide an environment in which learning will be prepared and armed with the skills needed for success, regardless of what our future may be.
It cannot be neglected that today's global business knowledge of language is very important for the future of each country, so that it must be reflected in education.
Therefore, the knowledge of modern languages should really be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer the choice of languages, diversity and excellence for young Scottish people.
It needs to be done well.

LeBron will play for the first time in Lakers' dress on Sunday in San Diego
The fans will soon be waiting for the first LeBron James performance for Lakers from Los Angeles.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would play the first preseason match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes they'll play.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton told Lakers' official website.
Reporters Mike Trudell tweeted that James probably wouldn't play the whole game.
After training at the beginning of this week, James answered questions about his pre-season plans in the Lakers which consist of six games.
"In this phase of my career, I really don't need pre-season games," he said.
Trump holds a meeting in West Virginia, a channel on YouTube
President Donald Trump launches a campaign with numerous gatherings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned collections that Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet given his voice to the new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the upcoming elections because there is a danger that Republicans will lose most in Congress after the vote in November.
What time does Trump's meeting in West Virginia begin tonight, and how can you look at it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 19 hours after East Time, tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Trump's collection in West Virginia can be viewed online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably comment on this week's hearing of the candidates for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh who have challenged the charges of sexual abuse. The Senate's decision to wait is a week before the FBI's investigation is completed.
But the primary objective of this series of collections is to help Republicans gain the advantage of the November election.
Therefore, Trump's chairman of the presidential campaign reports that five sets scheduled for the next week are "stimulating volunteers and consenting because Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"Most of the Congress is so important to the president's plans that it will travel to as many countries as we enter the burn campaign," Reuters's anonymous spokesman for Trump's campaign said.
Tonight's gathering to be held at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract accessions from "Ohija and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media," reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday the second time in the last month. In that country he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a senator's candidate, Patrick Morrisey, from West Virginia, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must help him improve the ranking in polls," said Politologist Simon Haedar from the University of West Virginia for Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team left its heart on the field before individual raids on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions the couple's raid on Sunday afternoon might be exactly what Ryder Cup was supposed to convert.
The phrase "about happiness turns" is which is especially worth in sports and in which athletes believe, and especially in competitions such as this.
Who's the lucky bike now?
"They had six points of advantage, and now they have four. So, I think happiness is currently on our side," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
The Europeans are in favour of four points, while the remaining 12 points remain until the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in his back and encouraged his game in a couple with Justin Thomas, with whom he won three out of four points all day after the game.
Speeth played kill from tea to green and can serve as an example to others.
Fantasy celebrations became more louder when Spielth and Thomas reached two points behind, and everything culminated in the key path that Spielth came to an unsolved result.
After the road he won the game with 15 holes, he followed a similar cheering storm in which hope and belief can be recognized that Americans can turn everything around.
"You just need to concentrate and think about your game," Spieth said.
That's all it's left for the players right now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who won more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup sensation.
A strange European couple has a maximum number of points and cannot be mistaken.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but he also escaped Bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back nine on Friday morning.
The winning series, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinaria, show that they are just the players to win on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two of them who can seal the victory of the Europeans while the sun rises above the Parisian Le Golf National.
Maybe they both win at the same time on different holes.
But it's too early to talk about the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly got Alex Norena and Serge Garcius who had a great performance in this morning's game of couples.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes in the playground buried Spanish and Swedish in a hole from which they could not dig.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one to help individuals get out of their hole.
It is fascinating to watch pairs nearby because you can see the interaction of players in pairs, hear the advice that they give and those they don't give, as well as study a strategy that can be changed at the moment.
Europeans have so far played better as a team, and in the last day they come in with a significant prejudice, but this game in couples has also shown that the US team has the necessary struggle, which some, especially the Stateside, suspected.
Europeans in the last day of Ryder Cup in the direction of 10 : 6
After Saturday's games in couples in the last day of Ryder Cup, Europeans are entering with a significant advantage over the United States of America at 10: 6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two victories over Tiger Woods led by four points of difference to Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn trying to win a trophy that drove her out of Hazeltine two years ago was more powerful than the American team in the morning games in couples achieved a result of 3 : 1.
The U.S. team showed a higher battle in couples winning two games, but the difference in points was already great.
To win the championship team Jim Furyk, you need to collect eight points in 12 single games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first debitant from a European team who won four points in a row, while he and Molinari are known as "Mollwood", after a sensational weekend only the second couple who won four points in the couple's history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they proved superior in the game against Woods and US debuter Bryson Dechambeau by winning 5&4.
Woods, who didn't show the best performance in two Saturdays games, made some brilliant moves, but now there are 19 defeats of 29 games in fourballs and couples and seven defeats in the row.
Justin Rose paused morning fourballs to go back to the couple's game with partner Henrik Stenson and suffered a 2&1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the first and third best player in the world.
But the Europeans didn't exactly go like the anointed during a pleasant day in the southeast of Paris.
Three-way winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday, so they put a ladder on top of their American team.
They first beat Spanish Jon Rahma and Ian Poulter with a result of 2&1 in fourballs, and then beat Poulter and Rory Mcllroy with 4&3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the entire history of Ryder Cup a team that was behind four points managed to get back in individual games, although Fury's team only needs an unsolved result to keep the trophy.
After two days in the back, it seems that Sunday's counterattack will be hard for them.
North Korea has announced that "no way" for one-sided untrustworthy disarmament
North Korea's Foreign Minister said on Saturday in front of the United Nations that further sanctions increase mistrust in the United States and that there is no way North Korea will be unilaterally disarmed and released from nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will last year", for example, stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear testing station and decided to halt the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
"But we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States," he added.
"If we don't trust the United States, we don't have faith in our national security, and under such circumstances there's no way that we're going to unarm ourselves first."
Although Ri reiterated the well-known claims of North Korea against Washington's "gressional" approach to denuclearisation, which would gradually abolish the sanctions in North Korea, his statement is significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearisation as Pjonghang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current President of the United States and North Korean leaders in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially put an end to the Korean war that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has stipulated that Pjongang should refuse nuclear weapons before that.
Washington also ignored calls for a reduction of severe international sanctions for North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that early denuclearization be carried out and increased pressure by sanctions to necessarily achieve its goal, and even opposes the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri added.
"The perception that sanctions can throw us on our knees is just the delusion of people who don't know anything about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases mistrust."
Ri has not mentioned whether there are plans for another meeting of Kim and Trump, which the president of the United Nations spoke of at the beginning of the week in the United Nations.
But the minister pointed out that Kim and the head of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, held even three meetings in the last five months and added: "If the denuclearization had been sought by South Korea, rather than by the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a halt."
Regardless of everything, the tone of speech of Minister Riya differed greatly from last year when he spoke before the UN General Assembly and said that the goal of the continental United States missile was inevitable after evil President Trump called Kim a "human missile" on a suicide mission.
Last year's Trump threatened the "complete destruction" of North Korea this year in the United Nations praised Kim for his courage to armaments, but added that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea carries out denuclearization.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no time frame for denuclearisation and added: "It is not important whether it will take two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia have expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of the UN Security Council said Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue strictly until complete, final and verifiable denuclearisation is reached."
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions for North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to halt funding for the nuclear and ballistic programme in Pjongang.
Pompeo met with Rio in the main UN assembly and then said he would visit Pjongang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said he had made progress, but North Korea called him after a few hours because of "gangster demands".
North Korea has agreed a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile location and nuclear complex that will be achieved if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He added that Kim found out that these "appropriate measures" relate to the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps towards the stabilisation of his relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard attend a course on how to get a good rest
The new course at Harvard University has enabled all students to sleep well in an effort to fight the growing culture of learning with caffeine and unsleeping nights.
The Academy has found that students in the world's best university often have no idea of the basics of caring about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has come up with a course he considers to be the first of those species in the United States.
He came up with the idea of a course after giving a talk about the effect of depression on learning.
At the end of the class, a girl came to me and said, "Why did I just find out about this right now, in the last year of college?"
She said no one told her how important the dream was, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
A course that is held for the first time this year explains to students how good sleep habits help in academic and sports success and generally improve health.
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University of Paul Barreira said the University decided to introduce a course after a serious lack of sleep was observed in students during the week.
The uniform course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of a student bedroom where students need to click on a cup of coffee, curtains, tennis and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how a lack of sleep affects success and how important a sleep routine is.
During the course, students learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Then a campus map with interactive icons is displayed that encourages students to think about their daily routine.
"We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," added Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride in all-night learning before the exam still exists, says the professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that the lack of sleep is a growing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and good dream. Sleeping helps also in the fight against obesity because a lack of sleep affects the brain, throws it into a state of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and biology from California, helped Professor Cheisler come up with a course after he attended his first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to extend the course to the entire campus.
As a next step, he plans to ask all post-graduates to complete a similar study subject before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students include an alarm during sleep, as well as during wake-up. They must be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" that emit displays of electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disrupt circular rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Empty eating Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after the Dolly Menge hit the missing defense of Steven Gerrard and finished the game with Livingstone's victory with the result of 1:0.
The team from Ibrox wanted to win the first victory after the triumph in February and result 4 : 1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches, so his team now leaves eight points in the Ladbrokes Premiership for the leading Hearts.
Menga reached the event seven minutes before midnight, and the Rangers seemed to have left without inspiration and didn't seem to equalize the result.
While the Rangers were now falling to sixth place, Livingstone climbed to third with only one faction of the difference behind the Hibernian.
There could be new problems for Rangers after the line judge Calum Spence got a head injury when he was thrown out of a distance of some object.
Gerrard made eight changes on the sides and so opposed by Ayra to the half-final Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same attitude of Livingstone that Hearts last week took the measure and would be thrilled to see his well-informed attitude extinguished every attempt of the opponents.
The Rangers may have had more balls in their possession, but Livingstone has achieved more with her.
They had a chance to happen two minutes after Menga was first kicked out of the game that Scott Pittman had opened the room to go towards Allan McGregor's goal, however, the twin had missed that opportunity.
The deep free hit by Keaghan Jacobs was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow could only follow an inaccurate blow to the rear lines.
Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game it seemed to be playing with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought the judge was supposed to bring him one aster in 15 minutes after his encounter with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson didn't import Columbia's request.
Rangers in the first half managed to lead only two balls to the goal, but former Ibrox's doorkeeper Liam Kelly one hit with Lassane Coulibaly's head and the pitts hit Ovie Ejari didn't represent a big problem.
Although the 34-minute playing of Livingstone has slowed the game, no one can deny their efforts.
The Rangers have again failed to use Jacobs' deep ball back.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added a ball to Scott Robinson, who held his position and chose Meng for a simple end to the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly Ryan Kent. The replacement had almost had a current effect because the wing player added the ball to Morelos, but impressive Kelly blocked it from its line.
But Livingstone continued to involve visitors in exactly the same game they enjoyed while Lithgov and Halkett made a long shot at each other.
Holt's side could have extended the leadership in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgov made a broad escape from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton was looking for one more late because he broke up with Jacob, but Thomson and this time he turned his eyes.
Almanah: Geiger's Designer
And now we follow a page from our Almanah on Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and a few days ago ...day of birth of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hansa" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed the method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, and from this invention he later developed a device known as Geiger's counter.
Since then, Geiger's main source of science has also become the main source of pop culture, for example in the 1950's "Bells of Colorado" film, in which the main roles seemed to be incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's numerator, and it's used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear atoms reacting to radioactive activity in minerals."
Evans: "Look at this, that's what's heard!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and destroy them
"The vaccine teaches the immune system that as part of treatment it recognises bad cells
The procedure includes removing the immune system cells from the patient and changing them to the laboratory
The cells are treated so that they can "recognise" the protein that is common to many cancers and then reinject to the patient
The experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immunological system to recognise bad cells, ovarian cancer has been withdrawn for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes removing the immune system cells from the patient, changing them into the laboratory to "recognize" the protein called HER2, which is common to many cancers and reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute of Cancer in the city of Bethesda in the federal state of Maryland said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and colon cancer," explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to withdrawing the immune system cells from the patient and their "learning" how to identify cancer cells was successful in treating one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West, after hosting a Saturday night live show, took part in a discussion about Trump and supported him, wearing a hat with the title "Let's Make America a Big Again".
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was expelled from the study during the Saturday night live show after the performance with the interruptions in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced he would run for President 2020.
After performing a third song evening called Ghost Town during which he wore a hat with the title "Make America a Big Again", he continued to speak against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so often, and they tell me, how you like Trump, he's a racist."
Well, if I were to worry about racism, I would have moved away from America a long time ago," he said.
The Saturday Night Live show began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although she was not broadcast, the video of West's speech on the social network was broadcast by the comic book Chris Rock.
It's not known if the announcement of Rock was trying to rob West.
Also, the West complained to the public that he was being pushed behind the stage because of the hat he was wearing.
"I was harassed behind the stage.
They told me, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
I've been harassed!
They said I drowned," said Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom?" and said he would wear his Superman coat because that means I can't tell him what to do.
Try with love."
Variety's magazine wrote that his comments were at least twice the public's disappointment, and the members of the Saturday Night Live show felt embarrassed, while one person said about the magazine: "The whole studio was shut down."
West was last called as a replacement for the singer Arian Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
The West performed the song "I Love It", dressed like a bottle of mineral water Perrier, amazed many.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, who tweeted: "One of the bravest people: Thank you for making the Mafia."
But the show leader Karen Hunter on Twitter announced that the West was simply "his own and that it was absolutely wonderful".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing or supporting his "art") for whom I believe he accepts and spreads ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are, too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, saying that he is now "will be officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, who's also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, the reper Snoop Dogg, called Snoop Lion, and of course, passed the music legend Prince changed her name into a symbol, and then in an artist previously known as Prince.
Charge for attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of trying to kill a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The police reported an incident in Ballyhackamore.
The accused should appear on Monday before the Constitutional Court in Belfast.
The charges will be considered by the prosecution.
Star Series Game of the capital Kit Harington turned to toxic matrimoniality
Kit Harington is known for the role of Jon Snow who is a cheap player in HBO's violent medieval fantasy of the throne game.
But a 31-year-old actor turned to a stereotype cat hero, saying that because of such television roles, boys often feel that they have to be strong to gain respect.
In a discussion on The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic matrimoniality in #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married a 31-year-old colleague of Rose Leslie from the Presidency's game series, admitted that he wanted to "resolutely" deal with this problem.
"I personally feel very determined at this moment – where we made a mistake with the husband?" he asked.
"What did we teach men, as they grew up, in relation to the problem we now see?"
Kit believes that television, thanks to very masculine figures on the screen, could partly be responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is born again, and what is taught?
What does it teach on TV and on the streets, and that makes the boys feel they have to have certain drawings of men?
I think it's actually one of the big questions of our time — how can we change it?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for the boys.'
He also admitted in the interview that he would not record the continuations of the presidency's game after its end next summer and said he "ended with battles and horses".
From November Kit will play in a new performance by True West author Sam Shepard, talking about a film producer and his brother's robber.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that meeting Rose's wife was the best thing that happened to him during the recording of the throne game.
"I met my wife filming that series, which gave me my family and my future life," he discovered.
Rose was in a fantastic series that won Emmy's award playing the role of Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow.
Couple married in June 2018 on behalf of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported an increase in new disease cases of 14 %
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV and the past has increased by 14%.
Health workers say more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were recorded only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases of infection have been transmitted by sex, which is a change in the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted throughout some parts of China as a result of a blood transfusion.
At a conference in the province of Yunnan, the Chinese health authorities said that a person infected with HIV in this way is almost gone.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and the past increases by 100,000.
The introduction of the HIV virus to sex is a constant problem between the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT is a big person.
Research estimates that, due to conservative values in the country, 70 - 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of disease in such relationships are due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of the effort to address this problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV medicines in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the public staff has submitted information about the GOP senators, calling it "dangerous lies" and "theories of conspiracy"
U.S. representative Maxine Walters denied a statement on Saturday that a member of her staff published personal data from three Republican American senators on Wikipedia's pages.
The Democratic Representative from Los Angeles has convinced you that you are being claimed by individuals of the "ultra right wing", as well as by websites.
"Truths, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published data allegedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatcha, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday, and it was published by an unknown person with Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate committee on allegations of sexual misconduct by the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after the three senators examined Kavanaugh.
Conservation sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have published that the IP address that reveals the source of the publication of these data belongs to the Waters representative's office, as well as information on the representative's staff member, reported The Hill newspaper.
"These unsubstantiated instructions are totally wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
“Member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false and false indications – is not responsible for the leaking of those data.
These unsubstantiated instructions are totally wrong and absolutely false."
Mrs. Waters' statement quickly attracted internet critics, including former White House Speaker Aria Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"It shows that Waters has no temper to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he didn't do must not be angry.
It can't be too beautiful.
He must not examine the motives of the accused.
He must be calm and steady."
It was felt that Fleischer compared the reaction of Barbara Walters to the criticisms that democracy has directed to the Kavanaugh judge, who was accused of becoming too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who competes against Waters in general elections, also posted on Twitter.
"It's important if it's true," he wrote.
Watersova stated in her statement that her office had notified these false claims to "moderate bodies and bodies of order".
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they bear legal consequences for all the actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she continued.
Film review "Johnny English: Again on the job" – not interesting Rowan Atkinson is fighting the spy
Now it is already customary in every new British movie to look for messages about Brexit, and it seems that it is also in the new display of the action series "Johnny English" whose first sequel entitled "Johnny English" was first shown in 2003 and returned to large screens entitled "Johnny English Again".
Will our own satire on how much we are obviously worthless become a new national export opportunity?
The incapacitated Johnny English eyeballs and rubber face again have permission to complicate the situation, while his name speaks more than anything about a comical creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinematography is not in English.
He is of course a secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims on the "diluted" glamour, reminds Inspector Clouseau of the character of Mr. Bean and somewhat reminds of that guy who played one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the ceremony opening the London Olympic Games 2012.
His character is also inspired by a passenger and a mysterious world man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard and who is a messy-off.
There's one or two hot moments in this latest movie release.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the propeller just hit his helmet.
Atkinson's physical comedy talent is visible, but humor is perceived to be rather uninterested and unusually superfluous, especially now that "serious" movie headlines such as "007" and "Impossible Missions" and themselves offer comedy elements.
Humor seems to be intended for children, not adults. In my opinion, the detachmented stories of Johnny English are not as innovative and focused as those Atkinson's non-gags are embedded in Mr. Bean's character.
The assumption that Britain is in serious trouble is already a general fact.
Hacker entered the most secret British web-network spy and discovered the identity of all British agents, to the horror of an agent on duty, which unfortunately appears to be Kevin Eldon's short appearance.
It filled a glass of prime minister's patience, superpower and warrior's character who is experiencing a complete breakdown of the system because he's politically hated: Emma Thompson's trying to show himself faithfully who should represent Theresa May, but she didn't really get the material to do something.
Informant advisors reveal that all active spies are compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate the retired agent.
And this person will be careless Johnny English with his head and beard, who is currently employed as the head of a school that's out-of-school, but he teaches subjects how to become a secret agent: here there are a few hot gegoes because English teaches rock-style spying.
English quickly brings the government to an emergency meeting, where he meets Bough again, his former partner and his eternal victim, who is acting as Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an over-excited submarine commander who plays Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely wasted.
And so the two members of the Secret Service of Her Majesty who are doing everything completely wrong are returning to action and meeting the beautiful fatal woman, Ophelia Bullett, who implicated Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, the evil Jason Volt, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their exciting journey with absurd and ridiculous stories: crushed into the barbers burned the decomposed French restaurant, the challenge of a huge mess, traversing the Voltina luxury yacht, and English provokes a complete anarchy trying to use the receivers for virtual reality to find out what the interior of Voltina's house looks like.
Everything has been done as needed for this last continuation, but as much as the film was attractive and dissipating, it still contains a lot of children's elements.
Quite a middle achievement.
And as was the case with other movies about Johnny English, I asked myself again if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would match his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to draw up a plan for British to work four days a week, and will be paid in five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corby will consider a radical plan that British people would work for four days a week and were paid for their five-day work.
The party allegedly wants the company's bosses to save past workers from the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) and give them an additional day off.
That would mean employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources indicate that the idea could be "apply" to the party's economic programme and plans for the country to be in the interests of workers.
The union congress supports shifting to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high source from the Labour Party said for the "The Sunday Times": "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"The four-day working week will not be achieved overnight, but it represents an effort that fits in the approach that this party has to balance the economy in favour of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept that tendency.
Speaker of the Labour Party said: "The four-day working week is not the party's policy and the party is not considering it."
The shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, took advantage of the last week's Labour Party conference to break his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to take over power from the hands of "behavior leaders" and "professor" in municipal companies.
The plans of the office in the shadow also means that current shareholders in the water management companies may not be able to recover their overall role because the Labour Government could make "debts" based on perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to involve employees in corporate management committees and to create inclusive own funds to give 10 per cent of the capital of private companies to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about "60 minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugha postponed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court for at least a week and asked whether the Agency's conclusion could affect Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, author of 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility that the FBI would discover something that would lead them to change their opinion.
Kennedy felt more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said following the debate, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
And I called unto him after that it was done, after that he was told, and said, Have ye done this?
He was determined, unconquerable, unconquerable."
Graham's voice, however, is as if he's fallen into a rock.
"I am determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and you really should have a strong charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has completely rejected everything," Graham added thinking about Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the persons she nominated could confirm her claim.
It's been 36 years since.
I don't see anything changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it achieved anything about poverty reduction?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission – the end of poverty in the world.
For the past seven years, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only the performances of the stars, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real objective of the event, the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free event ticket (except if they were not willing to pay a VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "work" such as volunteering, e-mailing to the world leader, telephone calls or any other meaningful ways of raising awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is the Global Citizen, considering that he has 12 years left to reach his goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people that they are calling for action, or just another case called "clickivism" – where people feel that signing an online petition or sending a tweet really changes something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its ports that have sought to achieve a number of different objectives.
It claims that these actions have been an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to an amount of over $37 billion, which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group imposed 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that funds have so far been directly affected by almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", an investor and provider partnership in the United Kingdom that is committed to "helping children develop to their full potential", with a promise that after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the world, they will provide $35 million to help Rwanda with the aim of ending malnutrition in this area.
"With the help of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can achieve that social injustice of nutrition becomes only a fuss in history," says Tracey Ullman, a ambassador to the Foundation "The Power of Nutrition", published at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the "The Power of Nutrition" project, which will provide food interventions for 5 million women and children.
As an answer to one of the most common questions on your website, which says, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?",
The Global Citizen answers: “It will be a long and difficult path we will sometimes experience failure.
But we're going to succeed, just as the big moves for citizens' rights and against apartheid before us have succeeded, because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawna Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among some of the performances on this year's New York event that will lead Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use a Navy as a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington may, "if necessary", use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, has discovered the US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner weekly says.
Zinke said that Russian engagement in Syria is particularly where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, an excuse for researching new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason Russia is in the Middle East is that it wants to sell energy in that area, as it does in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he says.
But in his view, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the openness of maritime routes and the blockade, if necessary, in order to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the presence of the host of the non-profit group Consumer Energy Alliance, which is represented in the US as the "voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, stressing that they are actually the same.
"The Lord's option Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuel," he said, and to Russia he said "uses the same trick" in economies dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements are simultaneously with the intention of Trump's administration to increase exports of its natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia with a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump's administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 (North Stream 2) gas project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "captive" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's strong opposition to the project was simply driven by economic reasons and that the example of unfair competition is an example.
"I believe that we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position provoked Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States to clone EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angele Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" the possibility of running for the president of 2020," states US Senator Massachusetts
The federal senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "consider seriously" the candidacy for the president after the mid-term elections.
During a direct meeting with the citizens of Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she thought she was running herself.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which means a woman on the front," The Hill said.
"After the 6th of November, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for the president."
Warren gave an opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with citizens, saying that "this country is leading in the wrong direction".
"I'm terribly worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticised Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugha.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren says: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think that they should run for 2020.
According to a study by the Centre for Political Research at the University of Suffolk / Boston Globe, 50 percent of the "trustful" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38% votes for potential candidacy and 48% against.
The other prominent names of the Democrats discussed in connection with a potential race for the 2020 president are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision by January, reports Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSP Track Palin at Donald Trump Collection
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after reporting in September.
He was arrested and accused of family violence that occurred on Monday night
"What goes through my son, what goes through after his return, is comparable to other families that feel the consequences of PTSP and other wounds our soldiers are returning with," said the audience at Donald Trump's meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin's arrest called for the general problem he was hiding about and said to his son and other war veterans that "they are returning a little differently, returning firmly, returning asking if there are any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all the other members of the army have given for this country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilli, Alaska, and was charged with family violence against a woman, obstructing the registration of family violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholized state, said Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the city's Police Administration of Wasille.
18 federal states and D.C. support the re-investigation of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that undermines asylum for victims fleeing gangs or family violence.
Representatives of the 18 federal states and districts submitted a friendly report Friday in Washington to provide support to asylum seekers who challenge politics, NBC News reports.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's trial against Sessions, which the US Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been discovered.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang" were abused, but US officials refused her request for asylum on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States come, as countries facing current gang and family violence problems.
The new asylum policy in the US changed the immigration committee's decision in 2014 which made it to immigrants who do not have documents and who are fleeing violence in the family, allowed to submit an asylum application.
State Counsellor Karl Racine said in his statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring tens of state, federal and international law".
"The Federal Law states that all asylum applications are settled on the basis of concrete facts and circumstances of the prosecution, and such a breach violates this principle," the report of a friend of the court states.
The lawyers further argued that the policy that slows the entry of immigrants harms the US economy, claiming it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour force".
Chief State Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop approving asylum victims fleeing family violence and gang violence in June.
"Azil is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his statement on politics on 11 June.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems even all the serious problems people face every day around the world.
A desperate rescue effort in Palu as the number of victims doubles in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting harder.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her boy who was shaking in a fever in the evacuation centre in a broken town of Palu.
‘Emergency assistance for imports of bodies every minute.
The government is depriving clean water."
Citizens have been seen returning to their ruined homes, reading through floodwaters, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, were disturbed.
Some of the injured, including Two Harris, who suffered a break in their back and shoulder, rest in front of the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated openly due to continued severe post-disaster shocks.
The tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feelings of a violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to be saved.
I think I was depressed inside the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, and added that his family came to the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "distorting" through "propaganda ads"
A week after official Chinese newspapers published four pages of long ad in the US daily list promoting the mutual benefit of US and China's trade, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of abuse of the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump addressed a paid supplement to China Daily in the most sold newspapers in Iowa, Des Moines Register, on Wednesday, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the American Congress elections on Friday 6th, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to blend into the US elections marked what US officials in the Reuters statement have characterized as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
Although it is normal for governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in the escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's revenge at the beginning of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, quoted Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, a US ambassador to China and former Governor Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had injured US workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Sunday issue of the newspaper Des Moines Register, Branstad says that China "now doubles this abuse by launching propaganda ads in our own free press."
"Through the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid ads in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, you will find limited voices of opposition on the street in Beijing, and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on the disturbing Chinese economic path because the media are under strong pressure from the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspapers were concerned.
The Republicans of Cavanaugh have removed voters before the mid-term elections, analysts warn
Since many Republicans are standing with the judge of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh and defend him on several sexual abuse instructions, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event were quite excited, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to give their voice.
Such things can't be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at Maxwell University in Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubt that the last instigation of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation would be sufficient to silence the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, and will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national speaker of the Progressive Group MoveOn, quoted the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors sang: "Come cold!", protesting in the hall of the Senate while the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee were preparing to continue with the Kavanauch's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond all expectations," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"People say they are already on a high level, which is true.
But they could be higher, especially among women in suburbs and younger electors, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they don't like the president, often don't go to elections."
Even prior to Ford's public testimony, in which her statements about the sexual assault by the Supreme Court candidate have been detailed, analysts suggest that a negative reaction could occur if the Republicans continue to confirm.
"It's a real mess for the Great Old Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, NBC News.
"It is not only a vote in committee or a final vote or whether Kavanaugh has been sent to the savings club, but also how the Republicans have access to it and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that assists in the election of Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about whom they will believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more inclined toward him.
A new survey published by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in the truth of Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said that they certainly or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that he thought that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same for Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the instructions Ford issued, along with at least one more prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Fordova testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that her candidate for the Supreme Court's trial showed her genitals at a party during a study in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to download Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company aimed at becoming a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology, Inrupt, is a company that develops on the basis of Berners-Lee's open solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and people to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee was concerned about the intention behind the Inrupt's "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said thinking on the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "personal network storage" or POD.
It can contain contact descriptions, bond descriptions, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that the decision is about who can access which information fully to the user.
The company calls it "the personal support of the data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to Chief Executive Director John Bruce, is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid be accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, security platforms purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed the project's work contract, as well as the voluntary programmers' communities.
Since this week, development engineers from around the world have been able to make their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which all their business models would be completely reversed overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a media release published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inruptova "was a mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of new networks built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he founded a World Wide Web consortium at the Technology Institute of Massachusetts (MIT).
In the last few months, Berners-Lee had an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even as the Inrupt moves, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web, the World Wide Web Foundations and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrates the High Priests of World War I by the Victorian Cross
Celebrations in honour of the only Anglican Church priest who was distinguished by the Victorian Cross as a fighter in World War I was placed in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had won the highest honor of the British military.
The monument was discovered by two of his grandsons at the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's approval for it.
According to the London Gazette official's report, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Vann led his battalion through the St. Quentin channel "through a very dense fog and under a strong fire that came from the direction of the battlefield and the machinery".
He later rushed into the first row and with "incredibly bravery" led the team forward before he ran without any help to the Polish top and cut three out of the military squad.
Colonel Vanna killed the German sniper on October 4, 1918. ○ something more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were "something that I know I could never achieve, and that is what stirs humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed the winery after the parade led by the parade orchestra Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he feels very honored to participate in paradise" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give."
The lovers of mixed martial arts remained awake all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead of him, they got the Peach of Peppu
Imagine this -- you stay awake all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches so that you will eventually be unable to track the main event.
The San Jose programme contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in the UK they showed live on channel 5 at night.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a match, viewers in Britain remained in shock when the transfer ended Praščić Peppa.
Many were not impressed after only staying awake until early morning hours because of the fight.
A fan of the children's art broadcasts on Twitter described it as "a kind of sick joke".
"According to the state regulations, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6 o'clock in the morning, so they had to transfer it to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communication Bellator, when asked about the transfer.
"Jupi, "Peppa's Praštić."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said he would coordinate his schedules to include viewers from Britain in the future.
"When I consider reprisals, I think we can probably take care of something," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to accomplish anything until we have Sunday, when they already have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was interrupted, many scriptures were circulated that were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't.
I can promise you next time it won't come.
We're going to keep five fights instead of six what we're doing, and we've tried to give more to our fans, but we've overrun.
It's a matter of unfortunate circumstances."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
The Olympic jumper in Tom Daley's water says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but it gave him motivation to become successful.
Twenty-four years old said that until he went to high school, he wasn't aware that "all are not like me."
In his statement on Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give others "hope".
He also said that his victory in the Olympics was less important since he became a father.
The regular director of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, took a few months to rest because of the disease.
Appearing as a waste in Laverna's first show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "less valuable" in relation to others because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, your feelings of inferiority and diversity in relation to others have been the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed. ”
He said he wanted to prove he was "someone and something" so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double winner of the bronze Olympic medal has become a prominent person who advocates LGBT persons and has used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt that he was happy that he could live openly without consequences and that he wanted to give others “hope. ”
The triple world champion said he was surprised that he fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an oscarov, who was 20 years older than him last year, but he said that the difference in years was never a problem for him.
"When you're so young, you're going through so much."He turned to his first Olympic games when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later . He said it was hard to find someone of the same age and to experience similar ups and downs.
In June they became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, all the stories would be about 'getting a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
Robbie is my gold Olympic medal."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said that his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they got tickets to London in 2012. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you won't be here long enough to be in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand while he was breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally become aware that he was not invincible," he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I only knew that it was what I had dreamed of my whole life to jump in front of the home audience in the Olympic Games, it wasn't a better feeling," he said.
It was also an inspiration to choose the first song of the " Proud" singer Heather Smallll , which was broadcast in it during the preparations for the Olympics and is always stuck in .
Desert Island Disks is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson outside the shape of the bench at Ryder's shop on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to recover completely in order to avoid an inconvenient switch.
Mickelson, who played this two-year competition for the record 12th time, sent Captain Jim Fury to the club in Saturday games with four balls and four balls.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as it was often for the United States, a five-fold winner spent a day cheering and playing his games at the gym hoping to correct what was bothering him.
Never the most precise player, even at the top of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding Le Golf National field, where long nervous terrain routinely punishes inaccurate strikes.
And if I'm not scared enough, Mickelson is in the ninth match on Sunday with the precise British Open Frances Molinary champion, who won every four matches this week with Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 single games with four points less, come to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Fury said he had confidence in his man more than that and couldn't say.
"He fully understood the role he had today, sunk me behind his back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"There's a lot of self-confidence."
He's famous and has contributed a lot to teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't imagine playing two games.
I figured there'd be more, but that's how it turned out and we thought we should do it.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Falda's record on Sunday by the number of Ryder Cup matches played.
This could mark the end of his career in Ryder's Cup that has never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven half-times, although Fury said his presence brought certain immaterial values on the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for it," he explained.
"I think younger players were having fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving a lot more than the game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of the individual Ryder Cup matches can be easily turned into an uncomfortable race.
Danac debuted in a game in Valderrama in 1997, where Captain Sevea Ballesterosa's team had the advantage of five points in relation to Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a significant difference of 141 1⁄2 ′′ 131 1⁄2.
"You always remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a slight difference," said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the 2018 team, who won the 5th score on Friday and yesterday led the 10th score on Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You'll play with full power tomorrow.
Go out to the field and do whatever is right.
Nothing's over until the floors are on the panel.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win this trophy, and that remains the focus.
I talk all the time, I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we are certainly aware of who is standing against us, the biggest players in the world."
Enthralled by the performance of his players in the hard golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never run into this.
Tomorrow he'll have to face a different beast.
Tomorrow's the main individual performances, and that's something different.
It's great to play with a partner when it's all right, but when you're there as an individual, at the end of the exam your ability to golf players.
It's a message you have to deliver to the players, and she's got to give the best of herself tomorrow.
Now leave your player because he has to give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they did with the players, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points of four.
Fury himself was on both sides of those big turns of the last day, since he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser after Europe carried out "a miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important swords tomorrow, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very beginning, like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When that turn goes in a certain direction, he puts great pressure on the middle swords.
According to that, we organized our position and set up boys as if we were, you know, trying to perform magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned a task of trying to lead a counterattack and facing Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmu, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the upper half.
I've decided that this group of guys is going in this order because I think it's covering everything," Bjorn said about the selected players for individual swords.
German new warship reset to waiting
The German Navy's latest fleet was to be released in 2014 to replace old warships from the cold war, but will not be ready until at least next year due to incorrect systems and increased costs, local media reported.
The launch of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ ship, the leading ship, completely new Frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, is now delayed until the first half of 2019, reports the Die Zeit list by referring to the military speaker.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying problems after delivery hit the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen Frigate.
As well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures, will have a strong top, a series of anti-fraud and anti-fraud missiles.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods Õ it should be possible to distribute the latest frigates during the period up to two years without returning to the home port.
However, constant delays mean that the most recent warships that are said to enable Germany to display power abroad will already become obsolete until the time of entry into service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate reached all the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship and returned it to the Bohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but the German media have cited a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" that would make the warship useless if it was sent to the combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships will run a crew of about 120 sailors Õ half the size of the Bremen class.
It also showed that the ship is a dramatic overload that reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the 'Rheinland-Pfalz' of 7,000 tonnes is twice the weight of the similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to incorrect hardware, the cost of the whole project Õ including crew training Õ also becomes a problem.
It is said that the price has reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
Problems affecting the latest frigates become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German maritime force is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that sailors are actually "decommissioning ships".
The officer said that the problem increased over time, because the old ships were out of power, and there were no replacement vessels.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates can join the Navy.
The National Foundation Listens to the Secret Life of Shishmisha
The aim of the new research carried out at the property in Scotland is to find out how bats use the landscape in food hunting.
There is hope that the results will clarify the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to conduct future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists at the National Scotland Foundation (NTS) will follow the usual and wet bats, as well as brown long and river bats in the gardens of Inverewe in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be installed in key locations around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NTS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile checks using hand detectors.
The expert analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the sounding of the bat and what kind it does.
Then a map will be drawn and a report will be created to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, the NTS Nature Protection Adviser, hopes that the results will find out which areas are the most important for bats and how each species benefits them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of work on housing management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has significantly decreased over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and work on an arrangement that affects shelters and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and light can also pose a danger, as can mussels and certain chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by cat pets.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their night fishing habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to the capture of prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to find bugs and obstacles along the way of their flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, is taking it very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, check shelters and sometimes save.
The organization even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the property of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats live in Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says the property is an ideal area for them.
"Here in Thrave we have a huge space for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good properties.
But there's a lot more we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and in other facilities will help us to better understand what they need for progress."
It stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before the construction works are started, since the unintentional destruction of one leg can kill up to 400 women and young people, thereby probably destroying the entire local population.
The bats are protected and unlawfully killed, tortured or harassed or destroyed their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a representative of the Scottish Shishmish Protection Association, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know how their population is moving."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while lawyers are preparing to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape charges against him as "false news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published these charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of rape by an American named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently he paid her $375 000 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video that he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers a few hours after the indictment, Ronaldo, 33, criticised the statements as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," says a five-fold gold ball winner in the camera.
"They want to promote using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the footballer with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for statements called "an unacceptable report on the doubts in the area of privacy", Reuters writes.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the football player will be looking for a reward for "moral damage amounting to the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights injuries in the past few years."
It is mentioned how the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the hotel apartment and the Palms casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga, as reported, returned to the football room, where he reportedly raped her, are listed in documents submitted to Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that "99 percent" was the "good guy" who failed that "one percent".
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that a couple had sexual relations, but that he was agreed upon.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she was photographed injuries in the hospital, but that she later agreed to an overseas agreement because she was "fearing revenge" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
Thirty-four-four-year-old says she wants to cancel the deal now because she's still traumatized by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the brink of a transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian jungle of Juve to make a transfer worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: The UK will "permanently repay" for losing car manufacturers
The UK will "permanently repay" if after Brexit the world's car production leader loses his status, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that, in case Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of waiting on the borders in Brexit's case could lead to loss of jobs without agreement.
The Toyota Auris and Avensis production of the Toyota Burnston has produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% have been exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My position is that, if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March without an agreement, we will experience the existence of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General Toyotin in Burnston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK expressed fears about leaving the EU without agreement due to possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says he's going to close his mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car manufacturer relate to the risks in the supply chain in the Brexit case without an agreement reached.
Toyota's production line operates according to the "just in time" principle, where the parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers to the UK and the EU for cars operating by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without the agreement on 29 March, it could come to an end on the border for which the industry says it could lead to delays and lack of parts.
Toyota in her factory in Derbyshire couldn't keep more supplies than they needed for one day, they said from that company, so production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said the "Checkers" plan that offers Theresa May for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need to agree. We want to reach the best possible agreement that will enable, as I say, not only to keep the present success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4 today's programme.
"The evidence not only toyote, but also other producers show that we must be absolutely able to continue this very successful supply chain."
In Toyota they could not say how long production could be stopped, but they warned that long-term vision, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnston for 24 years and who is a member of the union of the United States, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, after you leave, you will never return again.”
The government spokesman says: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says the White House
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein could "be delayed for another week" as the fight continues around the candidate for the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugha, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, the links between Trump's associates and Russia and any interference by the president.
The question is whether Trump will fire the deputy state attorney, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, but for months he's been disarming gossip in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the wires to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these statements.
But last Monday, he went to the White House in the middle of a announcement that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a rebuff with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News Sunday.
Regarding the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not specified, it could be this week; it could be postponed for another week, taking into account everything else that is going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to inform the press about everything."
Some journalists would object to this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Leader Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of a press conference is not the result of the "theatrical behaviour" of television reporters, although he said, "I will not oppose the facts to be confused."
She then indicated that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president organizes more meetings for answers to questions than any president before him," she said, adding without giving evidence: "We analyzed the figures."
A brief talk will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if journalists have a direct opportunity to ask the US president, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are often able to do this, and you have seen it in the last few weeks, and that's exactly what you can talk to the president of the United States will change the short talk to reporters."
Trump regularly gives answers to questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Lonely press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of the assembled journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU workers employed in the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU staff employed in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter six months before the withdrawal of the UK withdraws from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already undertaken to meet the costs of applying for EU citizens living in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal have continued, moving towards the expected decisions of this fall.
But the United Kingdom government is also strengthening preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
That is why I would now like to see how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
EU-wide colleagues, as well as wider, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after a head injury
The line player of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury in the Saturday defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores Club, with a result of 31 ○ 27, reports Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Master Coach Tennessee, Rod Reed, told reporters that the accident happened immediately before the half-life.
"He came to the playground line and just collapsed," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting it on the carrier and sending it for further searches.
State University representative Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the operation at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there was "no detail of the nature/range of the injury" and that Tennessee State was trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student from two years of gaming internship, plays the first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five rounds on Saturday before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 rounds in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when purchasing property in the United Kingdom
According to the new conservation plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when purchasing properties in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people
That step will neutralize Corby's efforts to attract young voters
The tax increase will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Riznica expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that a higher fee will be charged to foreign customers when buying properties in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be understood as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's effort to attract young voters to promises to ensure more favourable housing solutions and to focus on those with high wages.
Increases in taxation will be paid by individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will contribute to the government's efforts to combat homeless people.
The additional fee that is charged to the current fee, including the increase that was introduced two years ago to other houses and properties purchased for the purposes of the issue, may also be up to three per cent.
This move is expected to raise 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London buy residents who do not have a home in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy the first property to join the company of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas in the country have become "the cities of spirits" especially in the main city because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy followed only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax reduction to help a larger number of young people come to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking up but not using the country, and urged Mrs. May to give up the quota on affordable properties in order to correct the "hungry due to the housing situation" in Britain.
Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including housing controls and the end of the proposed investment.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Ms. May said: “Last year, I said that I would dedicate my mandate to revitalizing the British dream that the life of every new generation should be better.
And that means repairing our housing market failure.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it can't be right that individuals who don't live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign-born companies, can easily buy homes as well as valuable British people.
The dream of having a home has become too far away for a large number of people, and the shame of homelessness is still quite real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross says his "final ambition" was one day to become Scotland's manager.
Scotland (42) enjoys the challenge of reinvigorating the northeast club, which currently takes third place in the First League, with three points less than leading.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after last season he was running St. Mirren again at the Scottish Football Championship.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told the BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always dragged me back.
But this opportunity could still be achieved only if I was successful in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland's office include Dick Advocata, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neilla, Roy Keane, Gus Poyeta and Paul Di Cania.
Former Chief Allo Athletic says he wasn't afraid because he inherited so famous names in such a big club, after he previously refused calls to Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me at this moment will be measured according to whether I will be able to bring this club back to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably think of myself as successful only if I could get the club back there."
Ross completes only the third year of his administrative career, after a period during which he was assistant chief in Dumbarton and 15-month experience as part of Hearts' training staff.
Then he helped Alloi recover from falling into the third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of falling to the winner's title of next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirrena and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a real crucifixion," recalled taking Alloe.
"I really believed that management was what was right for me, more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I did well, worked hard and enjoyed a lot of success.
But the game can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure, but management seems like the right thing.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life."

The perfect time for the paint is at 17:30 on Saturday, as research shows
The summer heat wave increased revenue to British pubs who were struggling with the finances, but increased pressure on the launch of the restaurant.
The data show that pubs and bars have achieved an increase in income in July by 2.7 per cent, but revenues in restaurants have been reduced by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the Business Consulting Office of the Chief Business Book Controller, who collected the data, said: “The continuation of the good time and participation of England at the World Championship that lasted longer than expected meant that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when pub revenues increased by 2.8 percent, with restaurants now being more hit.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the revenues of the restaurants in June just got worse in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mainly served have achieved much greater gains under equal conditions in relation to losses suffered by restaurants.
The pubs where food is mainly served also suffered from heat, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In controlled beer and drinks bars, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and the sales of food increased by three percent."
Paul Newman, an analyst of the RSM for vacation and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we see since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales on the foreign market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to face difficulties, although the sales drop of 4.8 per cent at annual level will be particularly ill due to constant cost pressures.
Long hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for local leaders serving food, and time will show if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the necessary supplies."
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting slowing the growth of trade marks.
The system for monitoring sales in the Coffer Peach Tracker industry for the British pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes data on the efficiency of 47 operating groups, with a total traffic of more than 9 billion pounds, and an industrial reference value is established.
One of the five children has secret accounts on social networks they hide from their parents
Research reveals that one of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social networks hiding from their parents and teachers.
The 20 000 high school students survey showed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
The news strengthened the fear of publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account showing their parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, open secret accounts on social networks that hide from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 high-school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" accounts on the web site to share photos.
The news strengthened the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty-one percent of students said they use a clean "main" account to show their parents, while at the same time having private accounts.
One mother who came to the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged me with the words "violate me".
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools showed that 40 percent of students between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, half of which admit to own private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online places where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Committee
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual administrative body meeting.
Doyle is the most outstanding Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those taking the sport to take advantage of its wide international experience over the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and World Athletic Community and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will have great benefits by making him a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be a sportsman's voice and hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
An American, who won a 200-400-metre race in 1996 in Atlanta, of his four Olympic gold total, and now a regular BBC expert, after a passing Ischemist attack, could no longer walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would show if I would recover to what extent.
It was hard, but he recovered completely, learned to walk again and today to practice agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages."
Shared views on the Internet about a publisher advertising that compares mothers to cows
A company for the production of publishers with its advertising that mothers breast-feed their children compared to cows that encouraged the husband to share his views on the Internet.
To mark the launch of a product that is claimed to be "the first silent publisher in the world", Elvie for Consumer Technology announced an ad inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom the new publisher gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a state full of shade and cows with music whose text reads: "Yes, I am married to myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, this isn't vima, it's my breasts."
Then the refren says: “Expise, pump, feed the baby, pump, pump, I'll marry my ladies.”
However, advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook site, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed viewer reactions, and many say it sheds light on the "treasures" of the dairy industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children steal a few days after birth," one person wrote.

Another commented: “I understandably traumatic for my mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise the traitors to mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone added: "Fullly non-negotiable advertising."
Others defended advertising, with one woman admitting that her song was "excellent".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I could still get one, I'd buy one.
The delivery of milk made me feel just like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I figured it out the way it was.
This is a brilliant product," she said.
Another person commented: “This entertainment is directed to mothers who issue milk (usually at their workplace or in toilets) and feel like ‘claims’.
This is not a commercial that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovers that they all danced with discreet traitors located in the nipples.
The concept of campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who betray milk say they feel like cows.
The traitor Elvie is, however, completely silent, no wire or pipe and discreetly fits into the breast for breast-feeding, allowing women to move freely, holding their babies, and even going out during the delivery.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother’s agency, commented: “Elvie’s publisher is so revolutionary a product that it deserves brave and challenging launch.
Making a parallel between showing women and cows we wanted to focus on publishing and all its challenges, while at the same time in a fun and understandable way demonstrate the incredible sense of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This is not the first time that traitor Elvie has reached the headlines.
During London’s weekly fashion, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children held by migrants increased, although the number of monthly crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the heavy rhetoric and policies imposed by Trump's administration made it difficult to accommodate children under the sponsor's care.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors were immigrants themselves without documents and were afraid to jeopardize their own ability to remain in the country by stepping up and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to print their fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before the congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for sponsoring minors without escorting.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested earlier were not recorded in criminal records.
"Almost 80% of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the country's home are illegal, and most of them are criminals.
So we continue our search for those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to the shelter workers, with a view to speeding up the procedure for children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, which was previously standard.
Many will appear through a videoconferencing call, not personally, to bring their case before the immigration court for legal status.
Those who do not meet the aid criteria will be deported quickly.
According to the shelter workers' statements and reports that have emerged from the systems of the last few months, the longer children remain in custody, it is more likely that they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent outcomes or attempts to escape.
Protesters said that these concerns were expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, because of its size, signs of the child being tortured are very likely to be predicted.
They added that moving children to a tent town without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to greet friends can cause the trauma many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moulem, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has lasted for eight years.
Moualem, also a deputy prime minister, said that the forces were illegally on the Syrian soil, in the form of a fight against terrorism, and that they would "consistently comply with them and act".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," the assembly said.
Moualem insisted that "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, while millions have been left homeless.
He said Damascus will continue "a struggle in this world until all Syrian territories are cleansed" of terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in a war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were met and he blamed "some Western countries" for "widening irrational fears" that encouraged refugees not to return.
"We have invited the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicise what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the end of the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on establishing a zone buffer in the last major rebel Idlib rebellion created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive Syrian attack with Russia's support for the province in which three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would be directed towards jihadists, including Nusra front fighters linked to Al-Qaida, "who will be exploited".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to form a post-war constitution for Syria and open the way for elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of confidence should be limited to "revision of the members of the current constitution" and warned against interfering.
Why Trump will win second term
According to that logic, Mr Trump should win the 2020 elections again unless, as many liberal observers are likely to hope, the opposition and scandal will soon end his presidency.
In what would no doubt be "the most dramatic final presidency ever!"
Right now there's no sign of the viewer's murder.
Since 2014, visibility in the impact period has doubled by more than 1.05 million at CNN and has almost tripled by 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million visitors in a hit-and-run period, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast exceeded viewers with even 3.5 million viewers on the night of the broadcast of the main news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, a producer of ABC's "Designed Survivor" drama, about a government secretary who becomes the president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of comedy and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Five Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he laughs at me," said Mrs. Scovell.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the law on the expulsion of the origins of Roe's proceedings against Wade, can immigrant families be reunited as well as the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
However, you exceed the level of the informed citizen when you catch yourself watching a group of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of "deep backgrounds" for his book Fair, about Paul Manafort's jacket of leather worth $15,000 (“discovery item full of babacity”, Washington Post) and the implications of Mr. Trump's intimate descriptions, this, anatomy given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, Super Maria will never look with the same eyes again.
"Part of what he does is to experience it as a reality show is to feed you with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the producer of the Zlagaonica show, about the rotating acting position and the daily complications of Trump's show (a fight with N.F.L., praise Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna be behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fless this week, in front of his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauaija, it was sunny at 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was inside and watching MSNBC and filmed CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Judicial Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung about the end.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money from the outside is left in the most uncertain mid-year election race for the congress
It is not surprising that 17th-century Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the refurbishment of congresses that resulted in two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently rebuilt district of Pittsburgh's county stands out as a democrat, Connor Lamba, who won a place in another district in the past spring in special elections.
Lamb competes against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th county of Pennsylvania, which is heavily intertwined with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old circuits were continuously reduced in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a campaign financing fight between the main party funders, the Committee collecting funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after his victory in a wide-ranging special March election for the 18th Pennsylvania Congression.
This position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point pre-emption district.
Political analysts gave little advantage to democracies.
The U.S. is right if El Salvador should be punished for providing support to China, and then withdrawing
Diplomats have noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already acknowledged Beijing, with the small resistance of Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel from Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled Trump's management team.
State Department officials have decided to invite US diplomatic mission leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Speaker Heather Nauert.
However, the penalties were considered only against El Salvador, who received estimated US$ 140 million in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, including the reduction of financial assistance and targeted critical restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high levels of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity to continue a similar gathering last year, which was seen as progressing to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and that they actually interrupted any review of the punishment for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the administration attachs to the meeting, the diplomats said.
And three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or sentences from Washington.
Speaker of the White House, on behalf of Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the particulars of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal debates on anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst near the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next to be prepared could be a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on the possible interpretation of Trump's judiciary, which now has very significant public evidence available.
Mr. Mueller, as reported, also directed his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of her attack on our elections.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face the responsibility of that body, just when he is prepared to appear before the voters again, and perhaps in the end and with the jury of his levels.
There is a lot of these "if" and I don't want to suggest that Mr Trum's inevitable fall - or those like him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938 the German officials were ready to execute a coup against Hitler, only to the West oppose and support the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the casualties that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflation, and the unmistakable march of democracy is accelerated or later.
The Americans are now facing a few of these points of inflation.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires a deputy state attorney, Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since these newspapers reported that last year he secretly proposed recording the president and suggesting his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if a recently ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?"
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for Congress, which Mr. Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fall into those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I don't think we're going to fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once sat in my e-mail home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me to burn candles for a break on that table with a cuckoo cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before face-to-face with Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers are on Thursday host Rapid from Vienna, knowing that they will be won over the Austrians, after an impressive rhyme in Spain against Villarrela at the beginning of this month, to put them in a strong position to qualify from the Group of the G European League.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season until the 2nd season with Villarrela, but believes that Rangers can use that result as a jumpboard for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villareal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game believing that we could achieve something and we drew a point.
Maybe we could end up stealing the game, but generally, the unsolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
There's another big European night Thursday.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of the cheerleader, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year it was definitely hard, between everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now it has some good feeling.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy; training is good.
Let's hope we'll be able to continue now, leave the past season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that research participants had a clear preconceived view of what they wanted, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the nationwide students said they talked to their husbands about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't take steps to start the conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Life Insurance Nationwide.
Here's where it starts.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to take care, because your choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of long-term care funding can include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with a monetary value that will help you to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own wealth as long as you have money.
Manage your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the root.
Engage healthcare professionals to identify a reliable person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals satisfy your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also, consider giving full authority to manage your finances.
You want to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure payment of your accounts if you are not able.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and that he is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Enter the details in the written plan to be ready.
"It's not just about the finances, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Hold that plan by the hand."
A man shot several times from an Ilfracombe air rifle
A man was shot several times by an arrow from the air gun while he was returning home after the night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "a random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Tsunami and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, reported officials, and is expected to increase the number of dead.
Since the communications were interrupted, relief officials could not obtain any information from the province of Dongala, a region north of Palu, which is close to an epicenter of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some of the key facts about Palu and Dongal, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
It reached a county extending over 300 km north of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, the administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel miners are also important in the province, but mostly concentrated in Morowoli, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Paul and Dongal have been hit by a tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongal.
Tsunami also hit West Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26th caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: Under severe earthquakes it hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit south of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing the tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-degree earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died following the fall of the building.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where more than 500 people died, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president, Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
Palin (29), from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected family violence, a failure to report on family violence and arrest, a report published on Saturday by the Alaskan state police officer.
According to the police report, when the acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in Mat-Su's custody and is detained on an unsecured $500 bond, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he explained "innocent, of course", the network reported.
The fire is charged for three Class A violations, which means it could be in prison for up to a year and punished with a fine of $250,000.
He is also accused of a Class B violation, which is punishable by a day of imprisonment and a fine of $200.
It's not the first time they've been tried against Palina.
In December 2017 he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, invited the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Court of Justice of the Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of family violence, of neglecting the registration of family violence and of possession of weapons in an alcoholized state linked to the incident.
His girlfriend said she was hit in the face.
Sarah Palin criticised the Veteran Groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSP after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused the tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Networks for electricity and communications are broken, and the number of dead is expected in the next few days.
The earthquake struck the immediate vicinity of central Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia Jakarte.
On social networks, video recordings show a moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for a terrorist attack suspect in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a death sentence for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York where eight people were killed -- a rare sentence that has not been committed to federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used a truck to rent a store Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle track along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, where he cut down pedestrians and bikers who were on his way in October
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed eight victims and "intended" caused a serious physical injury, according to the news of the intention to seek a death penalty, which was endured in the South New York County.
Both of these points lead to any death penalty, in accordance with the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipova's federal grand jury struck a 22-point charge that included eight charges of murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors usually use in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "significant planning and preconceived," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "greed, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelinija, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendoze and Alejandro Damiana Pagnucca", the notice of intention states.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South New York County last prosecuted the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a federal case in New York, 1953, when married couples Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to espionage conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed on 19 June 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance in days and months after the attack.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he did, the police reported.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone he was inspired to execute the attack, it was reported in the indictment.
He also asked to report an ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police reported.
It turns out he's not guilty of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipova, said they were "evidently disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty, rather than accept the confession of the guilt of life in prison without the possibility of release to liberty, will only prolong the trauma of those events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek a death penalty.
Conservative Member of Parliament says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for talks about Brexit
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the national army" during a demonstration at the conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians had to "sympathize pressure" Eurosceptics since one of the members of Parliament Theresa May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bone told the instigators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be gone" by now that Mr. Farage was secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in the settlement of her deep-separate lines highlights the Tureans to withdraw the remnant that join a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep his compromise plan "Checkers" in the middle of the Brexit, the remaining EU attack.
The Allies insisted that they would continue with the attempts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction and force Eurosceptics and Laborists to choose between its package and "caustics".
Mr. Bone said at the joint "Leave Means Leave" campaign in Solihul that he wanted to "reject Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have received the title and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were chief, we'd be out by now," he said.
A member of the Wellingborough parliament added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel Chequers."
With its opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to bring our own laws into our country."
Mr. Bone has rejected the statement that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed the opinion and that they want to remain completely inaccurate."
The conservative and Brexitist Andrea Jenkins was also at the forefront, addressing reporters with the words: “I just say: Prime Minister, listen to people.
Plan Chequers is not popular in the public, the opposition won't vote for him, is not popular in our stranger and among our activists who were actually those who went out on the streets and chose us.
Please reject the Chequers and start listening."
In a prominent message, Mrs May added: "Ministers keep their jobs when they fulfill their promises."
Farage told the gathered that politicians must be forced to "sigh pressure" if they are to fail the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us people and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to issue Brexit and we're here today to tell 'it won't happen to you'."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, on the edge of Brexit’s edition, to feel pressure.
We mobilize the national army of this country that has given us the victory in Brexit and we will not calm down until we become an independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the remaining ones marched through Birmingham before holding a two-way assembly in the city center.
The majority of activists flocked to the "Torives against Brexit" transparents after the launch of this weekend's group.
Laborist Lord Adonis complained to the conservatives about the security problems they suffered from the party's application during the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus plan, for the unmistakable state of the border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "consider seriously" to run for the president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would "consider himself seriously to run for president" after the election in November.
Boston Globe reports that a democratic woman from Massachusetts was talking about her future on Saturday at a direct association with citizens in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for a scholarship in students against Republican Geoffa Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It's been a while in the middle of speculation to confront Trump in 2020.
A meeting Saturday afternoon in Hollywood was her 36th meeting with the citizens since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she was planning to run for the president.
Warren answered that it's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which means a woman on the front."
Arrest for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she arrested a suspect in a shooting with a fatal outcome from the state college basketball club in Louisiana (LSU) Wade Sims, which took place on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police published information on the arrest of Ditheon Simpson (20) at 11 a.m. at the conference for ET journalists.
They published a murder video on Friday, looking for help in identifying a man from the video.
Sims (20) was killed early Friday near the University of Southern Campus.
"Wayde Sims won the wound from a bullet in his head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, on 247 sports.
Wade got involved to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed he was at a crime scene and owned a weapon and killed Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without an incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police.
Sims, a third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the first 10 positions last season and on average 17.4 minutes and scored 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion after the order ensures his victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team's order would "play a great role in the race".
From the initial position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two circles and calling on Vettel to attack his team member.
Vettel first went to the box and left Hamilton on the market at the outset, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after the action of the wheel on the wheel which caused the Ferrari driver to trouble leaving the free interior in danger of delay after a double move in defense of the third fault.
Max Verstappen left last row and was the seventh to the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he ran a large part of the race while trusting in his tires to reach the swift end and run through Kimie Raikkonen for the fourth place.
He finally got into a box in the 44th round, but failed to speed up his pace in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day was hard because Valtteri had been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he was the real gentleman that let me pass.
Tim did a really great job to achieve a formation finish," Hamilton said.
That was a very bad body speech.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday for insisting that she did not release Christine Blasey Ford, in which she charges a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh for sexual abuse.
Addressing a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not give a direct attention to Ford's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "bad and bad and dishonest".
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and angry, ugly and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at publishing and leaking information in the public, then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leave the information?
Remember her answers... did you release the document to the public - 'aah, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let... no, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent in July a letter detailing Ford's instructions against Kavanaugh, and it was released earlier in September - but Feinstein demanded that the information came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statement, I didn't let her story in public," Feinstein told the board, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep her secret, and I kept her secret, which she was looking for."
However, her denial did not come to the approval of the president, who, together on Saturday night, commented: “Let me tell you something: it was a very bad speech by the body.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a worse body speech in my life."
By continuing to defend the candidates for the Supreme Court, which three women accused of sexual abuse, the president suggested that democracy use these charges for its own purposes.
"They are determined to return the authorities at any price.
You see wickedness, greed, they don't care who they're gonna hurt, who they have to run over to come to power and control," said the president, Mediaite broadcasts.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 ‹ 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars paid off for the defeat of Belfast Giants in Elite League on Friday winning in Dundee on Saturday with a score of 5 ′′ 3.
The Giants came in early minutes to the advantage of two naked hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home to reconciliation, and then Dwyer returned the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard settled for Dundee before the two goals of Lucas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third defeat in the season in the Elite League for the Adam Keefe team, who came out of the background and won Dundee's score 2 ′′ 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting of two teams, and the Giants won the previous three matches.
The two openings of the game arrived in the fourth minute, more precisely at 3:35, with Kendall McFaull's assistance, with David Rutherford's assistance to double the leadership of Beauvilleer four minutes later.
In the hurrying opening of the game, Sullivan returned the domestic team at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt allowed Cownie's reconciliation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first third with leadership when he gave his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The natives regrouped, and Bouchard once again brought them to an equation in the weighting of the force naked at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen to lead Dundee at the end of the second third, and he took care of the win when his team had already been halfway to win the last third game.
The Giants, who lost four of the last five matches, hostess were the Milton Keynes boys in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of passengers in the aircraft escape the quake
The air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he died while securing a safe flight of hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died, and many are watering themselves like disappeared after the great earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused the tsunamis.
Strong earthquakes continue to strike the area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his workplace in the control tower of Mutiara Airport, Sis Al Jufri, which was heavily floating.
It remained to ensure the safe flight of the Batik Air aircraft on flight number 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was falling apart.
He passed by later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirate, spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"Our heart breaks because of it," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the number of dead could reach thousands, and the state disaster relief agency says that limited access to the cities of Dongali, Sigia and Boutong.
"It is believed that the number of dead is still increasing, as many bodies are still under the ruins, and many could not even be reached," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the agency, said.
The waves that reached the height and up to six meters broke Paul into which a mass funeral will be held Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "She drove emergency aid every minute to import bodies.
The government is depriving clean water.
They rob small shops everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia's President Yoko Widodo arrived in Pala on Sunday and told the country's army: "Please all of you work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
A drop of aircraft in Micronesia: Air Niguini now says that a man is being treated as missing after an aircraft crash in the lagoon
An aircraft company that owns an aircraft that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one man is being operated as missing, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the aircraft that he was toned.
In his statement, Air Niguini said that as of Saturday afternoon, they cannot trace one of the passengers.
The airline reported cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and researchers in the search for the person concerned.
The air carrier did not respond immediately to requests for additional information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save the other passengers and crew after the aircraft fell into the water while trying to land at the airport of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were detained in the hospital on Saturday, and that everyone was in stable condition.
Which led to a fall and the exact outcome of the events remained unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some of the eyewitnesses thought the plane was missing the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to get through the water that cut them to the edge of the exit in case of the danger of the aircraft that was sinking.
He said the stewards panicked and yelled, and he suffered less damage to his head.
The U.S. Navy said that mariners working near the port repair site also helped rescue by using a steamboat to transport people to the ground before the aircraft sank in about 30 meters of water.
Air Safety Network data indicate that in the accidents of aircraft carriers registered in PNG in the last two decades 111 people were killed, but none of them were included in Air Niguini.
An analyst exhibits a time review of the night the woman is burned alive
The prosecution ended the case on Saturday in the retrial of a man charged with burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used cell phone data to agree to a puzzle about the move of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got location information from several phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers at the night she was killed, which is contrary to his previous claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at the same location as Chambersin at the time when he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to investigate Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "had agreed, because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Mobile data indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, a certain time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, phone calls and contact details.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense should start the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What's a enlightened hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to challenge a negative attitude toward the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The song group "The High Breed" from Bristol claims that hip-hop music has been removed from its beginnings by political messages and by focusing on social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop again popular.
Artists such as Fuges and Commons are born again in Great Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black girl?
New York's nanny sues a couple for cancellation after a "racial" message
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrong-directed message from a mother called "one more black".
Couples deny that they are racists, comparing the charge to "exulsion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when she found out after her first working day in 2016 that she was the new baby of her children, Giselle Maurice, a black woman.
"NOEEE ANOTHER CERNKINE," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in her message to her wife.
Instead of sending her to her wife, however, Mrs. Maurice sent her twice.
After she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in a "disgusting" situation, and she fired Mrs. Maurice, because she claims, that their former nanny, who was an African-American, was doing her job badly, and that instead she was expecting her to be a Filipino, broadcast the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got a paycheck for one day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice sues for a couple of dismissal fees and seeks compensation of $350 per day for a period of six months for which she was initially hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that I can't do such things," she told Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple replied that they were racist, saying that the end of Mauritian's employment was reasonable, because of the fear that she would not be able to trust her later because of the insult.
"My wife didn't mean what she texted her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband for Post.
"Would you trust your children to whom you were rude, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said his wife had only two months of maternity leave after the birth of a child and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You'll sue someone who's in such a situation
"That's not very nice," the investment bank added.
Although court proceedings are still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned couples on social networks, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers would not comply with the bear who spoke, revealed in a new letter.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in a letter: “It’s hard to get into the skin of someone who will read the book for the first time before it is published.
It's very fun what we know now about Paddington's huge success."
Said her father, who worked as a BBC recorder before a little drunk bear inspired him to write a children's book, was optimistic when his work was rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the book was filled with happiness and sorrow after his death last year.
About Paddington, described as "very important family member", she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite the man and was not a praiser," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, everything was experienced as a person reaching his own child: you are proud of him even though none of it is actually your work.
I think Paddington's success has been observed that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed credit exclusively to Paddington."
My daughter was dying and we had to forgive ourselves on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was urgently transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors were vainly trying to save her life.
"Now he regularly called to say it was really bad and to believe that he would not get away," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then Nad invited me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I must forgive her.
What I did.
I said: “Tashie, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep her heart working slowly lost effect and left her body system.
She died just before she boarded, and then everything went off.
I just had to sit down and wait knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything in me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who was already in mourning at the time of the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - who were not aware of the experiences she was experiencing.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head down, and my tears all the time slipped down my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt a strong feeling of condolence to Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Messages of a woman in mourning on a bridge in order to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put the cards on the big bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a cook with a contagious smile that was waiting for a bright career.
"They all remembered him for his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy."
But before he died, he left his job because he was in "a really dark state".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after taking his life.
Mrs Davis said, "I constantly worry that this will have a negative effect."
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea of cards “how people would know there was someone you could go and talk to, even if she was a friend.
Don't sit in silence. You need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt sad, depressed, or anything like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at the bottom of Christmas when the kids opened the presents, he didn't look them in the eye, he didn't want anything else."
She said that his death was a major trauma, but that they had to overcome it: “It all leaves a big hole in the family.
He's throwing us away.
But we will continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs about the end while the FBI launches an investigation
"I thought we might be able to introduce a little unity if we really managed to get something like what he was looking for," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding how he feared that the committee would be torn apart in the midst of the rooted alien blockade.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their distress was prompted by the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections arrive in just five weeks, November 6th, if, as expected, the Republicans do not pass well, then they will be seriously weakened in attempts to bring the desired man to the election for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush constantly summons senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes his report?
He will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, vice president, to break his decision-making vote and confirm his seat in the Supreme Court.
Number of escapes from North Korea 'fall' under the direction of Kim
The number of fugitives from North Korea fell after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Calling for information from the United South Alliance ministry, Park Byeong-seug said last year there were 1127 fugitives in comparison with 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors are stricter controls on the border crossing between North Korea and China and more taxes that smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang didn't comment publicly.
Most of the refugees from the north eventually got South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China is considered to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often violently returns them.
The relations between the North and the South that are still technically at war have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang at talks focused on ongoing negotiations on denuclearization.
This was followed by a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broader sense to work to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, blamed US sanctions for not making any progress ever since.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it does not come to mind that under such circumstances we are the first to disarm ourselves," said Mr. Ri at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "historic", says he is unable to serve at the Supreme Court
The leader of the opposition, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and said he was unable to serve at the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't but think that if she ever acted like that, she would be called a 'historic'," Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally demolished claims that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and sneezing while discussing his family and high school years.
He also expressly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling charges against him "grostic and coordinated overthrow" that organised liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not participate in the work of the Supreme Court because he showed that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
On the question of whether he will try to revoke the Kavanaugh if it is confirmed, and if democracy gets most in the House of Representatives, Pelosi has collapsed.
"I'll tell the next thing if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not only able to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democratic, she was concerned about the potential decisions against the Law on Access to Care or the Law on the Voyage of the Roe v Wade procedure, since she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh has overlooked questions about whether he will reconsider some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, polite person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful'," said Pelosi.
Women have to deal with it.
Reasoned criticism, anger that has been gathering for months and years, all of this cannot be wasted without pay.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steine 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual.
She continued: “She helped me a lot when she was a executive director and said that she too was crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that, when she got angry and started to cry, the person she was talking to said: ‘ Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I thought it was great."
The tears are allowed as an exit for anger, partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of the first jobs, in the office where the men dominated, is how I was, once when I cried out for unexplained anger, an older woman who was a cold manager who was always a little scared and dragged me to the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they think they've hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-court affair on the Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider running for the president.
"It wasn't a well-designed decision," she told me through the smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly did not need another one.
Someone called them "Snow and seven ducks."
Since the campaign had already slowed down, she was lagging behind in fundraising, and she said she wouldn't be in the race if she didn't collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of the dockers who gave her $1,000 to men gave her just $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she asked.
While she was saying that she was not going to launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings of gratitude for the people who supported her, by frustration over the system that made it difficult to collect money and to target voters instead of delegates, and by anger over sexism to get her throat pressed.
"You'd think I'd experienced a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder's media reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleinex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they'd put on my tombstone monument.
"She cried."
How a trade war between the US and China can be good for Beijing
The beginning of a trade war between the US and China has turned out loud and, while the battle is far from the end, the gap between the countries may be of use to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, U.S. president, first issued a warning earlier this year, warning Chinese key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation this week has emerged with new customs duties affecting products worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), actually restoring half of all goods arriving in the US from China.
Beijing has returned in some way every time, and recently a customs duty has been imposed from five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has promised that the US will respond to the impact, and the other world's largest economy will certainly not surrender soon.
Washington's withdrawal could be achieved by dropout, but public obedience to the United States would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the American trade war can provide a long-term positive support to China by reducing the interdependence of two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the launch of economic stroking in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a research associate for strategic thinking that focused on Asia in the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding the country that has destroyed a war that lasts more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the area of destroyed terrorist attacks in order to establish a normal situation.
Now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were directed towards their daily life and existence have been met.

At certain times, we have provided resistance to Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking Thomas' hat off.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna have to worry, I'm gonna work with PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee, so we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take off the hat from the people.
We're on top."
