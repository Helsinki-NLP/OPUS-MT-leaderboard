Yeah, she wants to...
"Schöne Münchnerin" 2018!
In the afternoon a surprise awaits our candidates again: they will not fight the romantic candlelight shooting before MY SOLARIS alone, but on the side of Male-Model Fabian!
Hvar - Flirting, cocktail, seduction - no simple tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Schöne Münchenerin" candidates deliver at the shooting with people photographer Tuan and fight wind, rain and rain like a real professional.
The romantic shooting is in the video:
DFB-Chief Grindel doesn't see any basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently does not see any basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the national team.
"That's a question that of course depends on getting into conversation once, that you're also talking to him about why he obviously felt it, as it is laid down in his status," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phasenmehrer" of the "Picture-Citizen".
Despite the month-long debate on the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I have also assumed that this would be the case until a certain time," Grindel said.
In July the 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team and also justified that he had not defended the Grindel against racist enemies during the WM.
The DFB chief reiterated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and Team Manager Oliver Beerhoff.
He doesn't want to build any pressure, but he knows it from the football so that if "you leave a team or a union change that you talk about it with his coach and I find it bad that this conversation hasn't stopped so far".
Linz: Garden huts burned in Schrebergartensidelung
At 2.13 p.m., the firefight Linz was alarmed to a fire in the firehouse.
Because a high voltage led directly through the Schreberg species settlement, there was a risk of delay.
The firefight broke out and found the cabin in full-fledged.
The roof had to be removed practically to the whole and firefighted to the required extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had burned an battery to the charge at noon.
That might be the fire thing.
In any case, the charger was located according to firearms in the area of the highest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be ascertained - as well as the fire thing.
However, he must have been considerable because the owner had many collector pieces in his garden cabin.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee families on the open street
What has Lindsay Lohan only driven to this extremely remarkable action?
She obviously wanted to enter a supposed refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fullly Loaded") himself has streamed live as she wants to enter a family in Moscow.
This reports the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial average of the stream.
Here you see "Happy kiss" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family who want to have her as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees right in front of the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
It oversees adult child trafficking.
For all of this, she doesn't provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees this," Lohan is listening in the video as she continues to follow the family along the road.
Apparently she's trying to separate the children from her parents.
Sometimes, however, it seems to be enough for the manifestly angry mother.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan's missing a earring.
Under the tears, the actor admires how shocked she is - and she keeps the wave.
What Lohan has moved to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the Asteroids
The "Hayabusa2" probe started in December 2014 in Japan.
It is designed to get so close to the Asteroid Ryugu that it can zoom material from its surface and bring it to the ground.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign Ticker: The number of deaths on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of force 7,5 and subsequent tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 deaths are reported.
The number of victims could continue to rise.
The rescue teams have not yet been deployed into the devastated and depleted areas of the outside world.
Elon Musk comes back as a Tesla supervisor
At first, it was a tweet.
Tesla Chief Elon Musk took care of the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car manufacturer.
The U.S. stock exchange supervisor accused him of fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and muscle must be paid, and the chief of Tesla withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he may remain the Chairman.
Party day of British Conservatives
Watch sharp - the party day of the Tories
Birmingham will be the stage of a power struggle.
The party is about foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference of Prime Minister Theresa May and Brexit Hardliners, to the front of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, is overestimated.
Reference for a new national name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these names for years.
Now they've united.
The state of Macedonia is going to be called North Macedonia in the future, and on this Sunday the population agrees - is it good?
Protests in Brazil against lawmakers Bolsonaro.
"El Nao" ("The Not") is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the elections in Brazil, the mood in the country was split.
Thousands went to several cities on the street to protest against the law-makers, Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump Brasiliens" is an anti-system candidate and is thus in the forefront of the surveys.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: Dieselgate upgrade takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force still exists," said Development Board Peter Mertens to the Automobile Week.
The arrested and approved Audi Chief Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the task force will soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all motor/driving combinations are expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens now said: "In early July we have achieved an important goal in the development of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was established in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel canal at the Audi-Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the autobuilder has made "graving organizational changes" so that such a scandal never occurs again.
On Friday, the VW Supervisory Board had passed a decision on Stadler's future and wanted to discuss further on this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities shall forward to the head of the audit to allow the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values, as announced by the gas dealers.
He knew about the manipulations or ignored them.
The company is currently headed by the sales board of Bram Schot as the Head of the Board of Directors.
Due to the conversion to the new gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production accidents in Audi, the "heilbroner voice" said.
Basically, he sees a declining demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8 produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment is difficult," he said.
Shot's on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi-Electro car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel attempts to reselect - Lahm should be in the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, in spite of his criticism of his person after the WM-out and the Özil affair in the coming year, wants to re-apply to the office as DFB President.
"I do my work and try to make it as good as it is," Grindel said as a guest in the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" early Sunday morning.
You have to try again and again for a re-election, I'll do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association found it "remarkable" if, after the award for the football-EM 2024, he did not "be able to work on the future project".
Grindel has been a member of the Association Manager since April 2016 as a successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who was a member of the Sommermarchen affair.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first complete term of office of three years.
The next vote will take place on the DFB-Bundesday on 27 September 2019.
The future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm is to cooperate, according to Grindel, in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that in this role he would also be consulted in the Bureau and then of course warmly invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," Grindel said.
In speculations, whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB leader, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair about photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player should become DFB's integration ambassadors without migration background.
Currently, this office of the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic has family roots in Cameroon.
"If a person with no migration background clearly affects society and football and says that "the issue is important, we need to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the site where integration needs to work," Grindel said.

basketball-Bundesliga: Clear performances for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin is launched with a clear victory in the new season of basketball-Bundesliga.
Against Science City Jena, the Vizemeister won with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing party for over 40 minutes.
New access Rokas Giedreitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 numerals) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appropriate performance before 9113 spectators in his compulsory debut.
Ex-Master Brose Bamberg won the performance debut of Coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at S.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was a 24-point best broadcaster for guests.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni arrived at 14 counters.

The new gamemaker Will Cummings exceeded the oldburgers with 25 numerals.
The Braunsweeger, where NBA-star Dennis Schröder has been the owner of the majority since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1-run of the basketball quickly ensured clear conditions.
Opens his or her mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier at his three-day state visit.
Criticism in Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to issue the Golden Movement supporters living in Germany and to take a stand against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow the PKK or Gulen movement sympathians to shield our citizens and damage the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib mosque, the Cologne City of the Interior was partially closed.
Several thousand policemen were involved - among them sharp shields.
The Islam Association Ditib is in criticism because it is considered to be an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": music against poverty: stars, drums and horrors
Musicers such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have spent more time at a joint concert in New York Central Park in the fight against poverty and disease.
"You are engaged, wherever you can, wherever you can only," Mendes said at the festival on the night of Sunday in front of about 600.0 spectators.
Thanks for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I switch, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and relief organizations showed themselves on stage at the multihour show.
Meanwhile, however, there was a moment of horror when many viewers kept the noise of a massive metal shield for shots, got scared and tried to flee.
In a short time panic arose, people ran away.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the people from the stage.
"No one's trying to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert was available as free of charge on the Internet every year.
Whoever wanted to read and distribute texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
On the other hand, for the numerous musicians and actors, there was the audience of Jubilee and Applaus - drums for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
This, along with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, appeared on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke on behalf of the U.S. Senate Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as Judge at the Supreme Court, and so many women were in the forefront.
At least three women have raised allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which it rejects.
Flake requested an FBI investigation of the proposals after he had faced two women who, according to their own data, had experienced sexual abuse themselves, on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You also like to come with me at any time in an elevator," Flake now told the audience at the concert in New York.
Press freedom: Federal government defends journalist's draft
Governor Steffen Seibert has defended the draft of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had taken over a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first series.
The T-shirt, if it wasn't the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
It was an interruption in the course of the press conference.
Through the actions of the journalist, there was a strong unrest, which was not acceptable.
That's why he's got people to take the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Office.
This is entirely independent of whether or not it is a legitimate cause.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are proposed alleged espionage activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Golden Movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the damaged Putsch trial on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threaten several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also not safe before the Turkish authorities: At the beginning of September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirgast was arrested.
Recently, the cases of the arrested journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had taken care of.
They came free and could return to Germany, but in Turkey there are still processes against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and well-known he is usually known by his fans: Florian David Fitz.
There you have to look twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Night" produced by the NDR is known for wet conversation at the Theke of the Hamburg Portkneipe "Shellfishposts".
Moderator Ina Müller attacks with her guests on some beer, some wine or even higher drinks to unlock the mood and tongue.
Not few promises are also used for the mandatory singing facilities.
Another consequence of the popular talk show was recorded on Friday.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Blessed Day".
The Münchner got the trip in the high north but didn't get any good.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely horrified, the eyes only two small pieces.
The bed-selfie shows a completely exposed Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he's only got a powerful cat.
Towards his fans he posted some - probably not quite serious - findings he has now won: "Rule one: NOT going to Inas night.
Rule two: never drink the black sauce.
And Spritz.
And the round egg liqueur, which ina smears about half three, also lets go.
The alcohol consumption is really written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans just posted a few tips to fight the riots.
They are made of instant bread, fish bread, or - probably at the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply amused themselves about the view of the normally attractive kinostar.
As Ina Müller has survived the night so far, it is not known.
Since she has moderated TV play on the theme since 2007, the 53-year-olds seem to be much more experienced...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight Vandalism and Unrat
The entrance to the 36 km long railway road in the Red Käpchenland in Treysa presents itself difficult to find and wash.
Recipes against the gruesome vandalism are sought, but solutions are hardly drawn.
Scherben, cigarettes, garbage and dirt, demolished mussels and now demolished signposts - this has been a long way from the entrance with a seat group to the bike road on the Haaße-Hügel in Treysa.
For the preview object railway road in the Redkäpchenland there is a more than imaginable view.
The topic deals with members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, so the city's railway manager Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the Radiation Board.
There's no solution.
The proposals range from the removal of the seat group to the regular discharge of the waste containers and the cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the last would be the order of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been included in the local council.
Not only does the garbage run around bike drivers and residents - the seating group is at the weekly regular meeting point to celebrate.
It is not only often said that in the layers it is also destroyed: cracks from the ground, demolished mussels, painted paintings, damaged seating furniture.
Volunteers had already cleaned up more frequently, told ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are just the verbal drops on the hot rock.
They are angry that the rust place on the bike road in Treysa meeting point is for storage.
"The focus is clearly on the Haaße-Hügel along the entire cycle path," confirms the bicycle traffic officer, who is now also taking care of the new railway station in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be very expensive."
Another idea was video surveillance at the hill: "Maybe it makes the threshold significantly higher to get into the community.
However, this would require a police check to be carried out in time.
In principle, West Hagen wants to develop the Haaße hill.
He had to be more attractive.
The frequency of the cycle so far can be very satisfactory.
The tourist market is still fully accessible.
Our bike route is very high compared to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger site, ADFC member Susanne Klippert assesses the situation in the Ascherøder Straße in Treysa.
There's no absconding on the Haaße hill.
In the case of direct traffic, it may happen that bicycle drivers have to wait in the middle of the road between traffic flows on both sides," she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for older and especially for children.
Music-Contest at the Cultural Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the Lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and intertwined.
"D to present a song for Hiltrup" is the call of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for Large and Small, Young and Experienced Music".
A contest "with eyebrows in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family meeting with coffee and cakes from the honorary officials of the cultural railway station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived albachter in Hiltrup, nine of the "helprup star colors", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the children's garden Lummerland and finally Rick Weßling and the Schwarties.
This contest, said District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We have not yet experienced this in other parts of the city.
Where did the texts come from?
At the places, the Hiltruper Lake and the Marketallee were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig shorted the Allie in his striking song to "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural railway station was also appreciated.
It was always about meeting each other in these places, especially at Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke experienced the short conversions with short interviews with the interpreters or references to their creation.
This is how one learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
To report to the sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew that he was recently in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvey in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed everything on YouTube.
"It's not about winning," said Frank.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomy.
For the favorites of the jury, however, there was something special - so that others could hear their songs.
An entire CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lumerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators at guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all of them, the children came to the finish again - and even sing without electronic support "very good", as Franke said.
Leading the jury was the originality of the aspects, reference to Hiltrup, the introductoryness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the West Fälische School of Music, Andreas Klomfäß from the KvG gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economics Association, as well as Jan Kaven, president of the district offensive.
The district offensive had caused the event to come to life because of its ten-year existence.
She considered the event a success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the very soon full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that meet each other.
For each page, there is a visual display containing four cards with keywords that you can decipher - the old trick with the red foil - only when you have inserted it.
Thus, it is ensured that the opposite side can also read from memory.
Then on the map, for example, you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Würfel.
"Fest."
These are the terms that are used to encrypt it in the meantime.
Because the terms are not to be discussed here, but codes.
By contrast, one player per team is the cipher.
He gets a code card that might be "3.4.2".
They are to be consulted in "Decrypto" not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should, in this order and in this example, describe the terms "workers", "fest" and "windows" - so that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team is not possible; for that wins the party if he succeeds twice to break the code.
Thus, the cipher reads aloud: "Throw" for the cubes, "Lose" as the opposite of the party; here, of course, it would also be possible to do something like "Party" and "Prag" because he has taken care of the school and knows the window crash there.
So it goes round for rounds, team for team.
Although you do not know the terms of the opposite side, it can be better combined with any indication that the cipher is there.
Perhaps mysteriously, but not to be reversed should be the inscriptions so, otherwise you make it unnecessary for his team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic of "decrypto" is the rule.
The co-players probably have to study it for quite a long and detailed time until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But whoever has just released will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this invisible game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as succinct as predecessors and genre primes "codenames", which also push a subject of agents to play less words, but it is much better to play in small groups.
And who is only about advice and not about points of victory, it can also easily find a version for two.
Kullbach: Man shows police Hitlergroß and harasss guests in the button
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulbach on the night of Saturday at twice the same time on Sunday.
He first showed the Hitler Great in the Upper City of a passing police raid, and later he also fell in the Upper City in a button when he harassed other guests.
After he failed to comply with the clear alcoholization of the place indicated by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulbach in the prison cell.
In a more delicate state, he must then be held accountable in criminal terms for the use of trademarks of law-enforcement organisations.
Works Pressig was home to the school block
The railway operation in Pressig was the turning disc in Frankenwald for decades.
A piece of railway history ended in 1991.
"When buffers broke into buffers, you heard it in the press," recalls Georg Dinkel, who records the history of the place and the railway station.
That didn't make anyone feel good.
The brakes were still there, and the wagons were knocking.
That was just a clear railway.
Statements that are meaningful to Dinkel's home press.
Nowhere in Frankenwald was such a place marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Stilerampen mountain range to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 meters, has its lowest point in Steinbach am Forest.
In order to deal with this, early train and shoe blocks were needed, which had their home in pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway station with 21 lokschuppen, training workshop, guidance and train championships.
"Herzstück was the turning disc that had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirscheid, railway historian and 47 years of professional travel.
From the railway works (BW) Pressig, which was subjected in 1968 to Bamberg, Loks for the adjacent Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben were also operated.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported on a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Ellocks were then stationed in pressig.
The electrification of the 1939 route has already minimized the need for train and school blocks.
From 1977 they were used only in goods trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 roads were still ranked in the month.
In 1982 parts of the works were cut off, 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that no better use of the site, even in the point of freight transport, has been made."
Even at Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
Don't worry about it later.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were removed, the Rangierbahnhof Pressig was history.
"The Rangers and Hemschulers did the most difficult work on the train," Dinkel recalls.
Every mistake had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen train station has led to the conversion of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current images are found here in the infraredPlus article.
Kerber with success in China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon Sieger Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round in the tennis tournament in Beijing as Julia Görges had previously.
Kerber defeated the Chinese Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the World rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kasachsten or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund conducted 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian assigned to number 13.
The Schwwabin is now getting to do with Anett Kontavit from Estonia.
A special exhibition in Mittelehrenbach was opened at the weekend in the series "Art and Pleasure".
With great relief, organizers and visitors registered the ideal weather when the special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in Freigeland of the property Dahlmann-Schmidt.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism association "Round oms Walberla" in the "Art and Enjoy" series.
She opened her gates in the 15th year.
A great visitor's speech showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be visited in Meditelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the Vernissage.
He's been on his own since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who became the main organizer and artist of the same name.
A bit surprising, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his task into proven, young hands with a good perspective for the future.
Both have already been active in the past in the selection of artists and have co-designed flyers.
This year, too, there is once again a 70-cent special stamp designed by Kunst & Enjoys, available at each art station.
There, this year's poster "Betzn Austanzen" can also be designed by Volker Hahn, to be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high commitment of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was able to be won for the musical frame.
In the course of the generous garden, it will quickly become clear to the visitor that the title "windplay performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it.
Art works are made of metal or ceramics, often provided with colourful accents.
At the entrance of the property, the visitor is expected on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree trunk, colourful, playful with 20 windmills, 24 capes and 24 alu tubes as soundpieces.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object works smoothly and invites to rest.
From the Ekental, Barbara Washneck, who prefers in three dimensional letters dedicated to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts in the wind in motion.
On a half-way, Siegrid Frey from Ekental presented her work "The Wind The Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, the people of Hahn show their colorful fantasy figures of tone, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" is to slide through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singer celebrates 50th birthday party
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And also the Al-Qadars at that time made their foolish airs.
At least five of them.
They did not want to find out everywhere that there should be no more singing in the district after the church church was dissolved "Cácilia".
It has now become a legend: At a bank in Tinnenbusch, they raised the MGV 68 albums from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter".
"It will be full today," said President Jürgen Holsteige, and he should be right.
150 guests there was a real success for the Albachten singer.

The climber marches.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC Pattern under the control of Axel Büring is right in the league three.

Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routine forces and brought the full benefits to the goal.
"We all know who's in such a Derby on the other side.
That doesn't break our genius.
I've seen a really good volleyball in phase," Annacker did not have the 0:3 - and immediately went over to the agenda.
Where the trip goes for the independent, it does not seem visible after just three days.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one feeling he confirms: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
It is not nearly comparable with regionalliga volleyball.
If the west is not polluted in the next few weeks, they have to look up.
A first balance sheet, however, can only be drawn after ten, eleven parties.
On Saturday, it's just going to Emlichheim.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the dream ship, Heide Keller became the star.
Now she says openly that the series might have been guilty of co-existence with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chefosstès Beatrice of Ledebur on the "traum ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 01, 2018 she went on board forever.
The series that led them to the star could be responsible for their failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she had been married for ten years.
"That could also have been a reason.
Because I was raised with this work, traveling alone with a suitcase around the world, and many of my amazing colleagues took me for granted," Keller tells us in conversation with the "Picture on Sunday".
At first, she was always only "the wife of Hans of Borsody", but this changed with the "traum ship".
Because now the journalists only call at Heide Keller's.
"If he liked it so well, I don't know."
She considers it possible that her husband at the time could have been totally rude, but "how many men also shed his talk about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried for Hans of Borsody "to be the only right person and he wanted to know my fears, not my weaknesses.
That means good German: I understood," as she further explained.
She always felt like "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who I was never really, even though I appeared on stage sometimes frequently and courageously.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid it might happen a second time".
On the day before the permanent trauma, I sat in the wardrobe and wanted to give up everything.
The marriage of Borsody also broke out.
Why'd it never hit the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had the love at the time "as shown in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not daily.
I'm too naive to fall in love."
The nightfaller, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ resort Zurich, has this time moved to the ZFF opening party.
Our fault is not a mote, but a little light.
And the green glow, in which a green carpet is carved on the sixth floor, mixes it with a fee.
But it is held film festival, where more or less famous ones wish to shine in the light of light.
So on this late Thursday evening, he wrangles over the place to make it easier in the Aquaclean-WC-Oase.
This is the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The necessary facility in the partnership of a new pavilion is a great effort to stream a luxurious atmosphere.
On this evening, however, in the Lord's Oasis it stinks for some reason to heaven.
So out here, across the other side of the street: Loaded guests, who have just held the "Green Book" in the cinema next to the opening film, celebrate the start of the festival every year with a party in the three-storey shop.
His name fits perfectly to this film festival: From all the earthball the works shown are known.
What does not have to happen to an article about this festival in order not to fall into fraud for its 190 partner companies.
The fold binds itself with a belt around the felter, which has attached a good foothold to him, and two bullish doorkeepers actually swung him in.
Indrins push the loads, they dance far after midnight to live music or can be preceded by DJ rhythms to which they flock each other, and wash down with Cüpli exquisite hippies.
In the subterranean delicacy shop, oysters are waiting for swallowing coins, next to the unparalleled raw ham Culatello di Zibello, a chocolate fountain is spread freshly.
And the hammer is: all the sales rules are completely exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
It has been like this for years, so it seems without great losses to work.
You must love this country!
The foldr will study the sign at the roller step: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the roller step".
If the two separate instructions are, he's gone into the dress code.
But it is rather a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the House of Goods department at the top floor, the birds pick up a cocktail prepared with Espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the Festival Award.
The price for the best drink is not compulsory for this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who's been throwing the brand for years, is not here at night either.
However, between local promenade, cassette and kitchen articles, there is a face above which appears to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
It should not be far from his main supplier.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, with almost sixty acting like a chorus, walks through the crowd.
He's not being harassed, he's not getting caught, he's got to steal the most.
Just for this retention, like to misunderstand as foolishness, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Trainer and former football star Diego Maradona is happy for the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home in Mexico.

Handball: League 1: USA Send to Last-Minute-Pleite "to the ground destroyed"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the U.S. Handball leaguer, could hardly say: "So a bitter defeat". His shooters were "destructed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the game - on Saturday night at LIT Germany 2.
They had not played well over long phases, as in Steinhagen, as against Hillhorst, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we've been totally asleep", the US coach was upset.
Soon the housekeepers with 8:1, even the early time that had taken the ticketsky, did not bear fruit first.
"But then suddenly a crack went through the team," said Bielettsky for the second quarter hour.
For the break, the rest consisted of only two doors.
Especially the best of sendes, Marius Hintze, met in the phase about another time.
After the change, it was even better from the visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst left at 15:15, followed by the staff changer almost passed.
Four minutes before the siren, the advantage still seemed to be relaxing three hits (29:26).
And then?
Take the non-parties into the event.
Bieletzki tends to avoid seeking fault with others.
But: The 120-second time penalty, the Steffen Mühloff cashed, "was a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and met up to the end four more times - while the tenth U.S. had also broken down in the last attack.
The boys fought great, also against seven men standing well and throwing them on the empty door all the time.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now you have to win a damn victory," says the restless running Bieletzki.
U.S. Towers: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlål (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühloff (2), of the Pol (2).

Elon Musk, founder of Tesla's electric car manufacturer, has disappeared as head of the billion-thousand company.
He and the U.S. Stock Exchange Supervisor SEC extrajudicially contributed to a legal dispute over misleading Twitter news, in which the Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay every 20 million dollars, and for three years, Musk gives off the office of the Chairman, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board.
The Head of the Board may remain.
In the comparison, which has neither to be confirmed by a court, neither muscle nor Tesla's behavior is at stake.
The SEC had complained to the world-renowned manager before the United States Court of Justice of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, also known as the SpaceX space company, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer who is currently rated at the stock exchange with more than 50 billion dollars.
Musk is not guilty
Musk told me he didn't do anything wrong and was sad and disappointed about the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk wrote his more than 22 million Twitter followers, he might take the company from the stock exchange and pay $420 per share to secure funding.
In order to achieve this, Tesla would have been assessed in total at $72 billion.
Later on, the muscle rumbled back: Tesla stays at the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla now has to find a chairman from outside, set up two independent board members and set up a committee to monitor the Musk communication.

Investigations: 46% want Merkel not until 2021 as a chancellor
According to the sources of the past few weeks, the GroKo is dropping several surveys.
The SPD falls in a survey behind the AFD - Angela Merkel is seen critical.
Berlin - The AfD has taken over the SPD in the Emnid-Sunday Strand for the first time on Sunday.
In the weekly survey of the Institute of Opinion Research, the AFD adds a figure of 17 percent, the SPD gives a point off compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU also lose a numerator and only get 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union so far in the sunset.
Greens reach 15 percent, left 11 and FDP 10 percent.
If the federal election were on Sunday, the government parties would receive only 43 percent of the votes, according to Emnid.
As a result, the large coalition has now lost the majority in the question of Sunday at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The government parties reach 43% to 45% of the votes (allensbach: 51%).
At the 2017 federal election, they received 53.4 percent more.
For the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AFD, in several surveys the second-strength party, is 15 to 18 percent.
Greens reach voting rates from 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average 10 percent, FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down depending on the vote.
But also the retention of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has significantly decreased since the 2017 federal election.
Currently, only 48 percent of the citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the office, as the Emnid inquiry on behalf of the BamS showed.
Only every second (50 per cent) wishes the survey today that the large coalition holds up to the next regular federal election in three years, 41 per cent for a new election.
In a further survey published on Saturday, there have also been significant popularity fines for Merkel.
The Germans also assessed whether Merkel should re-apply to the CDU presidency in December.
47% are according to Emnid, 44% on the other hand.
As a result, 64% do not want a candidate, 35% do not want to join the Union.
Trip to Aldi: Price reduced to love luck
Is Aldi going to Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in times of Tinder, there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - that should be discussed at Aldi's time about Putenmeat.
Munich - In times of digital fast food dating through Tinder and Co., the supermarket is a know-how place for the great love of almost anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced puppie meat, boxer shorts on the volleyball or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later single children than a mere sip to the right.
The app Tinder is called to be less contact, but rather a loopless stock exchange.
We have weighed the test: How do women react, but in the first message they don't talk about the hot breeze for long?
Here's the amazing result.
Normal Hollywood Lovestory potential has then, when the love luck is ahead of an out-of-the-eye lost and re-found plot.
If the type is still reported under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de with its suppliers, then it sounds very good to Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So the author of this ad in an unknown Aldi branch of ours is to wish that she will also find her dreamer, with whom she has had a brief discussion of the "30 percent reduced bio-puten meat".
For the faith in the magic of analog learning, she earned her Happy End à la Hollywood anyway.

Football: District League: Researchers' appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, as Alois Fetsch went to court with his heart.
Wordcarg he gave himself to the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, only to return (inside) to sing about the lack of performance on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it is running around the Brandhove road again.
The 1:1 on Sunday against the SC agers, in the past playing time only high-ends on the rise passed.
Yeah, I'm very pleased with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and sought out each one of them for simply saying "thank you" for so much opposition against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to perform a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg - it almost ran out of the 4-4-2 in a 4-2-3-1, where Niklas Thewes was waiting in front of the ball.
Wolbeck had significantly more play parts in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his Aus (17th), the changed Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the leadership.
It would almost have happened when the SCA in minutes 41, once twice in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbümer, appeared dangerously before the Wolbecker case - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL often took full control.
Thewes of 18 meters fell barely.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes at a Tewes-Herein.
With the exchange of Miles Geske, Fetsch missed the left side again a fresh cell course.
When the 70th minute Robin Westhues fell by Chris Naberbaumer, 18 meters before the guesthouse there was an indirect freeway for the square.
The foult himself attacked and demonstrated his danger to standards.
Westhouse" The thing with the right shoulder hit down from the left view of the shield - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes to get the hell out of here.
And then this: VfL-Captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80s.
Judge Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not let the gift go away (79.).
Bange had to pass Wolbeck in the final phase, before the geese in the 87th minute of 12 meters, but still had the victory match on the puss.
Maybe it would have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhouses, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Report by the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rare figure in corporate affairs
As a result, only 8 percent of the executives were female on Saturday 1 September, as the report "The Power of Monoculture" presented officially by the Allbright Foundation on Monday and submitted to the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to stand up differently, otherwise the international competitors will move over to them," said Founding Director Wiebke Anchorsen.
In the United States, the UK or Sweden are purely male-occupied leadership teams - with few exceptions - no longer possible.
The balance makes German competitors less diverse, innovative and future-oriented.
It's another corporate culture.
The small increase in women's share among the German stock exchange companies was also due to positive incentives for the medium-sized enterprises (MDax).
Although according to Allbright data, only 6.8 percent of the executives are female.
However, in the previous year, the value was still 3.8%.
In the 30 dax companies - in the past years the female population has stagnated.
Last, 26 women worked in the offices.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will be recruiting consecutive women again in the coming year - in their own interest," the Anchorsen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signaled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the share of "null percentage" so far.
Another picture appears in the supervisory councils: On 1 September, the women's share was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"In 2023, as many women were recruited annually, a proportion of 40 percent would have been achieved," the report says.

In the first half of the year, Ferrari made 69,000 Euros business profits with each car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only about 800 Euros, Tesla and Bentley are very busy with each car.

A holiday evening at the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, 5 October, in the guest's house, before a day later goes into the second round at the feast.
In Bonn: Notarztauto force in Taxi
A car is badly damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passenger was killed.
When notaries are called, they are supposed to help - save the best even human life.
Such a rescue trip took an end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was killed in Bonn when a car hit by a taxi.
The taxi driver, the notary and their drivers were severely injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the Notarztauto had passed a red lamp on Saturday afternoon with Blaulicht and Martinshorn.
He was then on a cruise with the taxi that drove to Green.
After the collision, the car slammed against an ampelmast and a tree.
He recorded the passerby who died in the accident.
Motor vehicle driver and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the user car were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be released from operating forces.
The seriously injured 29-year-old nurse was also able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another rebuffed notarist tried this - but without success.
The three serious injuries were brought to hospitals.
The police find out in close consultation with the Bonner State Prosecutor, who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we make it uncomfortable
After the blamble out in the Ligacup Manchester United is now also lost in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United is subject to ManU 1:3. The manner of the defeat may still be discussed.
The scene was significant in the 74th minute, when Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot the 3:1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had probably led the Red Devils back into the game.
Since they suspected an offside during the pass of Mark Nobel, all the opponents of Manchester remained, and Arnautovic left all the time in the world, the ball at the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative height of an already far-reaching power failure.
It's a very different place at the United City of Manchester City.
The citizens trained by Mourinho's great competitors Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Howe Albion to a 2-0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling for the home team broke the alien's defense line for the first time.
Sergio Agüero took care of a good hour and a double pass with the former torso protection for securing the sixth win in the seventh game, thus also for the jump to the table tip.
Liverpool no longer a table leader
Three days after the 1:2 descent into the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri won a 1:1 match with Liverpool in the Premier League against Chelsea.
As with the Cup-Aus, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in the Londoners.
The 27-year-old hit in the 25th minute remained until the final phase of the only hit of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, lost the compensation shortly after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his slender.
After the reds were started with a smooth balance in the week, Chelsea was not to be beaten for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the Remis in the League, the Blues Liverpool were still breaking out of the table top.
Like City, the two London City Clubs tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2:0 victory.
However, the fans of the Gunners, in which Granite Xhaka was playing, had to wait until 81 minutes for a success report against the surprise team from Hertfordshire County.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart entered the door unluckily, only two minutes later, Mesút Özil took care of his third season meeting for the decision.
Arsenal, thanks to the fifth victory, passed on to Watford and is again behind the great rival Tottenham on Rank 5. A strong impression continues to be left of the rising Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
At 2:0 against Southampton in the League, the wolves remained unbeatable for the fifth time, and were placed in 8th place.
VW core brand missing: Pariser car salon in the sign of the Diesel debate
The Paris motor salon takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet all-current: The Diesel Canal and the Ring for Traffic Prohibitions and Disassemblies should not be released by the German auto companies even at the meeting of the industry in Paris.
At the 2018 Automobile Salon, they will show their news from next week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel doesn't actually play a big role anymore.
The possible exchange and settlement offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should nevertheless be an important subject at least behind the shining scenes of the trade fairs.
A great name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have, among other things, their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the Ingol cities will come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarts 2019.
Officially, both have already been presented.
The next one of BMW is due to start in 2021.
The new 3rd is centrally located in Paris.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car groups, motorcyclists as well as numerous mobile and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a million visitors were welcome.
In the severe earthquakes and the following tsunamis, at least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Tens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injuries.
On Friday, the island was shaken by two earthquakes.
The first bee had the strength 5.9, the second was the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, there are huge damage to trade.
After the bees, the tsunami broke in on the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the numbers of victims will still go to a very high level.
So far, the numbers have only come from Palu.
However, there are also numerous other municipalities - along the Sulawesis West Coast.
Some 150 bikers celebrate God’s service in Verdohl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for the motorcyclists in the Church of Peace in Eveking on Sunday.
Verdohl - The place before the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
The final Goddess service for the biker was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor-pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westfalen and is therefore responsible for the soul-surgical interests of the PS-strong dual riders.
Between April and September, on the last Sunday of a month, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place at the house Nordhelle.
The end of the season the bikers traditionally celebrate in the Peace Church in Eveking.
There, on Sunday, about 150 bikers gathered to do something other than regular God’s service.
From 10 a.m., the bolidians were on their way to the entrance gate of the church.
At first, the biker breakfast shops were on the program and it was expected to be strengthened with coffee and cakes or even with a strong currywarst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
During the biker-godess service, the sermon was held by Pfarrer Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided for the musical meditation.
"Although the biker prefers the Blues-Rock, Valerie Lill hits rather poetic-silent sounds," said Fr Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novel in the history of the motorcycle Goddess Service yesterday.
Füchttorfer Home Association celebrates a great feast: After the apple the milk comes
And even on the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg was also of great interest.
He had his apple press in his pocket and demonstrated his standing audience step by step the process from mature apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and filled the apples in the big trenches.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely trimmed mass.
Still, many of the children could not imagine how they would once be a tasty drink.
However, they were able to take a look at this important step on Friday afternoon.
Packed in forms and covered by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemergerg stacked the slightly-looking apple pieces for layer over.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step has not been so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice ran into a large vessel.
However, the plant farmer also had already completed specialties.
Thus he opened his "Schatzkiste" and presented the oldest visitors with the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Fuchtorf" was accordingly large.
In a warm atmosphere, the parents came to the conversation, while the children could not only follow the apple press process, but also discover the built-in Hüpfburg for themselves.
Also active in the Füchttorfer comradeship of former soldiers engaged in the festival and invited to some stations for short-term games.
A day of action will also be offered by the home association next year.
Then, as Gregor Krützkamp pointed out, the home will not be in the heart of the spargel village of the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also because of the topic: finally it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season plea: "The situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga descent, Trainer André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professional from Hannover 96 and spoke boldly to them.
However, many positives were previously seen at 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Entracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out there as a team," said 96-footballprofi Príncipe Schwegler and shuddered: "This is, of course, disappointing, because you always get a lot ahead of yourself."
The further Sieglosen Lower Saxonys, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) joined, are standing down with two numerators and in their current constitution they are a candidate for descent.
Guided by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first season victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59) and Luka Jovic (89) reached the doors for the DFB Pocal winner, who, following the successful general test for the European League game against Lazio Rome with seven points in the midfield of the table.
Croatia's Vize-Weltmester Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of the Hessen and never received from Hanover's defense.
The long shocker after the WM showed with its pace and power of implementation why it is so valuable for the investigation.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, borrowed from the FC Liverpool, was the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurt, which began to swing.
One of Lucas Torró's headballs on the tornet was lost (17th) for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was arrested in a searchable position in the last moment of the 96-warning around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back) in the short term.
The leadership for the housekeepers fell almost compulsorily and entirely deserved.
Philip Kostic picked up the ball after a rejected corner in the courtroom, Haller extended by head before the door where Ndicka only needed to stop the foot.
It was the first federal league match for the French secondary player AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt was still waiting for the break.
This time Haller met his storm partner Rebic, who was able to meditate through and 96-Torwart Michael Esser left no chance.
In the half-time Hannover-Coach responded to the weak image of his Elf and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
However, the Lower Saxonys now played a bit more bravely ahead, but in the short term, ideas remained out of place than the connection meeting still reached.
The Hessens were much more efficient.
After a few hours, Rebic started a solo and then laid down on De Guzmán, who had to move the ball only to the empty door.
The rest was only for the Frankfurter against the overloaded guests, and Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix place will be in the middle of the country
In spite of chilling temperatures, a good mood prevailed at the October party in the city center.
The Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter created it before a million audience at the opening of 185.
Munich Wies'n in the last week with two blows.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christian Celebrates Saint-Kreuz-Fest
The Geisingers Catholics celebrate the Christmas celebration on September 14th or Sunday thereafter.
The holiday service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Cross church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church is home to the shot Christ, who comes out of the war of the 30th year and should have shot the legend after a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flows out of the gunshot wound.
From this, a great pilgrimage developed to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not completed until today, only the old room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
In spite of the importance of the Geisinger Pfarrei, the service was bad.
After the service of God, the procession took place to the Holy Cross Church and, in conclusion, the church part of the cross-fest ended.
For many years the Catholic Church has been inviting the world part of the festival to the Catholic parish.
The members of the choir provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of kitchens and the weather adapted, farmyard.
In the afternoon, the parish community also offered guided tours around the city church, and Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone work and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will continue until next year.
After the storm has been standing for some time, the damage could be detected more precisely and the individual tenders were prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the refurbishment is more expensive than planned, because the damage already present a few years ago has become greater, but more has also been found, which was only possible by the appearance of the eyes through rain.
Sockel work is completed, before winter it is still to start natural stone work, and we hope that half of these works will be completed this year.
Dedication: New residence in the New Ulmer Münsterbigbigstraße
Donau-Iller's life aid opens a new residence for people with disabilities in the Münsterbigstraße.
The fact that "a very special house" will now be given to its destination in the Münsterblikstraße - all those present agreed at the time of accession.
Finally, the 12 wheelchair drivers who have been living in the Danube-Iller residence for some time have been pointing to the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, flores and doors, larger rooms and accessible access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former U.S. Army's office building was put to the test for the inhabitants with mobilecap: "The house had come in the years and no longer in time in the equipment," Bader said with a look.
In 2016, the bakers called on to demolish the house.
The new building should be made as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable there, so the architect.
Life support Donau-Iller opens new residence
Around 4.6 million euros invested in the construction of life aid.
The state of Freistaat directed 2.4 million euros, the county of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to Architect Bader, the construction works remain in the planned framework - both temporary and financial.
For this, he was also thanked by the manager of life aid, Jürgen Heinz.
The spagat between a barrier-free and at the same time fireproof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, planners and artisans had built a home with the many standards that would allow the inhabitants to experience freedom to move without any help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the Schwaben district, Gertrud Kreutmayer, also said: "The house is focused on the special needs of its inhabitants, who need help to be mobile."
The habit and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real accident because it is no longer possible to acquire in the present situation."
A total of the new residence in the Münsterbangstraße offers an area of almost 1500 square meters for 30 disabled people who are divided into three groups.
Pride is the life aid manager Heinz to the eleven full-time workers who are all employed at the rate.
Germany: Swiss complained differences between East and West
Berlin - Prior to the day of unity, SPD Vice-Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all the people of the country not to meet with the defeat of East Germany.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
With these differences, we must not satisfy ourselves," said Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the "day mirror on Sunday".
The goal should remain to create the same living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that the East Germans worked on the average longer than the people in West Germany, but 15 percent less.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after the German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this dirty dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan-Jagdhund is supposed to smooth the roads between the two Koreans.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pjöngang has made the South Korean President Moon Jae a gift in two North Korean pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moons' office announced on Sunday, the two old dogs reached their recipient on Thursday for about a year.
They then crossed the border of Panmunijom along with three kilograms of dog feed to make it easier for the animals to enter.
The dogs with the thick white fur, sharp ears and brown eyes are considered to be loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship was announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and the North Korean mighty Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pjöngang.
Both countries also agreed to join together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and jointly apply for the launch of the 2032 Olympics.
Kim also agreed to include the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket drives in the course of the mutual approach.
Austria's moved history in mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100-year anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this year for almost ten months now, numerous new books have been published, most of which answer this question in view of the past hundred years.
In a very different way, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, will appear in the magnificent "Image Book" Austria, which will appear on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to work - this is the informal motto for the Great Coalition's start-up week.
Almost an interview, hardly a talk in which the Chancellor and his ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have recently held the "back to work" mantraly.
This may have led some handicrafts, doctors, cassiers and other professional citizens in this country to the right question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but it is through.
If the Federal Government is now to devote itself to its task - to the government - then it should not be held back with the concept debate.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and blasts of the last few weeks, it may already be shown on Monday.
In the evening, the heads of the government will join the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call on this round regularly to remove conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, there are conflict-based issues on the agenda with the diesel equipment and the immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to allow the car companies with exchange premiums to get away with it, SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the obligation to refurbish older diesel technology.
While an approach has been drawn up over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the proposed immigration law.
The SPD calls for a life perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or do training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "spur change" of the asylum system in the labour market.
So there will again be a dispute among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equal and equal has joined the Groko, but three partners with a number of very different social models and priorities.
It's a good fight.
Without a dispute, a society drawn up by so many conflicting interests does not proceed.
However, in order to be constructive, the dispute must not be brought up again for partial reasons on the question of His or herself.
It's still about politics, not theater.
The Union and the SPD are going to fight - but they always have the real life of the people in view.
What is makeable and useful to many?
With this guide, both the diesel and the trace exchange question can be explained pragmatically and thus regain confidence.
This is why the People's Party must now fight.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in Visier
Does the Minister of Labour commit a violation of the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"True day and night" had worked on their legislators in the reform of social security, reported an overcrowded social minister at the presentation two weeks ago.
In the case of Liste-Pilz-Mandatar Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is surprising - it brings the matter to Parliament by request.
They assume that "the Minister only expressed his enthusiasm for the use of his team and did not want to announce any violations of the right of service in front of the current cameras".
Nevertheless, they now have questions to be able to free Har Tinger from any suspicion.
Police are on a road looking for women's bodies
Marxgreen - Lange didn't want the police to talk about it.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, on the state street between Naila and Bad Steben is buried.
The route is still closed in the Marx Green area until Monday.
It had been suggested that the investigators had previously used an archaeological dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was able to limit the relevant place to a few meters along with its leader in multiple use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered with scientists at the Technical University of Munich and the supreme Bavarian Memorial Protection Authority in the area of the said street piece.
For more than a year now, the State Prosecutor and the Criminal Police have been working on the missing case.
Again and again, a bicycle was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the detectors assumed that here in the train of the state road heikes body could have been tightened 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: Krawale in Barcelona before Catalonia-year-old
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is the first time.
But it's already going to come up with scratches.
The separatists have not forgotten the police use since autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence Referendum of October 1, 2017, there have been clashes between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence officers, among other things, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3000 police officers from the Police National and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues, who were in use last year at the referendum in the lobby.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from paying the vote, violence had also occurred at the time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and the central state security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the 6000 separatists, however, would have tried to break the police record, and the officials would have thrown them with colour guns and eggs, among other things.
Six persons were arrested, 24 others were slightly injured, it was called to the authorities.
The independence referendum is the first time on Monday.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed forced administration in autumn 2017.
The then Regional President Carles Puigdemont fled to exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement continue to sit in U-Haft.
New elections were held in December.
After the entry of the new Catalan government in May, the compulsory administration was terminated.
But the new Regional President, Quim Torre, is also on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Upper Westfalls: Collected advicelessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate torlos
Red-White Ahlen continues to take place.
Also at FC Gütersloh it is only a 0:0 decision.
The final light and the third one opened up before 438 spectators at the Heidewald Stadium as a collection of advicelessness.
The first half was observable from the entertainment factor.
Therefore, anyone who wanted to get a beer or a brat was able to do this unconcerned.
There was no danger of missing a torchance, because there was virtually nothing.
First shot after half an hour
Nick Flock was responsible for the first (unarmed) Torschushus of the whole party in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle only true - the ahleners had the possibility when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling was forced to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the fine line.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was in an early shift.
Sturmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced with a condition of injury, for which Sian Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the ever-increasing delay.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel targeted almost 18 meters over the case and after an hour the goods were also first exposed to offensive.
After a roundup of Matthäus Wieckowicz it was fixed.
The newly introduced counter about Sinan Aygün "kronte" Nick Flock (62.) with a loose shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also played with a headball by Wieckowicz (66.) after an Eckball of ex-Ahleen Tim Manstein.
RWA-Interim Coach Angelo Daut reacted, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It worked - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative, the Ahleners did not make it possible.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but they also didn't bring in anything.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero" but unfortunately the zero was also ahead.
"We weren't as dangerous this time as we were against woodwives and even though our opponent didn't want to play here," observed RW Ahlen's Interim trainer.
Offensive "placing everything like that" against a team, "it just wanted to defend.
I didn't have the feeling that we could get a opponent," said Daut.
However, as an observer of his suffering, he did not have the feeling that his team could shoot a door.
The idea was too clever for that.
Reckonfelder Erdedanskmarkt: Luckily, there are enough Kreimers
The happy Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder table editions for which these donations are intended.
The honoraries assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky appeared brilliantly blue, and the space was still empty, but this should change during the day.
For, "It's so nice to be here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a proper price humor.
For the couple Brockmann, who should actually be weighed down against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer are in a short time.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are plenty of Kreimers.
And the "resistance" was not allowed to take place by entertaining the increasingly musical visitors.
This was so good that a few members of the people were together in a few hours later.
"Simply great," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to spend the opening time this time in his schedule.
He is pleased with the many assets with their standings, including mainly associations.
"In fact, there shouldn't be something like a table," he thanked himself for the action of the men's body.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were on the stand and also concluded the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town has a colorful anthrax - something is going on here.
Then the maikranz was removed from Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the firefight and brought to the winter quarter.
On many stands it was worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to heart it was all to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has lived in Reckenfeld for a year, was creative at his discovery.
Forner work, beer lid with reckenfelder Motiveen and a few more he had in offer.
A speciality was offered by three Reckonfelder Immer: "Rackenfelder Honig", accompanied by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buchschlüter.
The last name still has a specialty.
Honey in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Then the little Elsa had to get back to her, so the cake was so good.
Sociality is the one that allowed visitors to stay for a long time until the evening, even without a stage program that doesn't exist at the autumn party.
Smuggling with local policy message: No successful advertising for skate facility
In Lengerich, strangers have spent hardly any form of funding for the construction of a tax facility.
In several places, there are corresponding sewers, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have sent a fine for damage to the case.
In large letters on paintings, among other things at the Gempt Hall and at the Old Town Hall, the three words "Scatepark for Langerich!".
Michael Rottmann, manager of the Hall, reports that after the vocational election fair on September 19th, a corresponding written statement was discovered on the ad at the step-up to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an Edding in its time, they could have been removed without problems.
"Just a few days later, however, it was there again this time,” said Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising bill must be replaced.
A special note is given just in this case by the fact that several large companies from Langerich are also mentioned on the table.
If the tax facility is built, it will also be made possible by sponsors.
Promises already, Jörg Hesselmann explains from the urban district school, sport and culture, without names.
But it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical with those companies that are on the polluted table.
For years local policy and administration have been dealing with the issue of taxation.
After the old one was demolished at the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council spoke mostly for the firefighting park.
This idea was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a building in this place.
At the end of June, a turning point followed.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word then comes from the City Council.
It leaves a decision this year so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Engpass is getting worse when you fly
Frankfurt/Hamburg Germany does not see signs of improvement in the coming year following the European air traffic crash in summer.
"In this year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said the head of the aviation insurance union Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency before the air summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and delays in flights has been the long-known staff note on European aviation insurance, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new lots takes four to five years," said the trade union.
Europe-wide, the market for pre-trained lotions has become empty.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace, about one hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticised the fact that various air carriers were not invited to the summit.
In Hansestadt, representatives of the federal, country, aviation, airlines and airports come together on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work coverage and overtime, it will not go without us," explained the Head of the GdF, who has many members in the German air insurance department.
Maas again made the EU commission responsible for the lots.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 have been too low.
The cost requirements and staff savings resulting from this are now fully applied to the operational business in the national aviation insurance sector.
Maas called on Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to apply to Brussels for regulations that "do not block the air" insurance.
At present, the EU proposals would be aligned by 2024 and there would be further aggravation.
The EU has been constantly exposed to lobby printing since the airline.
"Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have said themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs for airlines were rethinking.
The GdF will only be involved in improving the situation if the German Aviation Insurance (DFS) offers a "agreed training and future pact", Maas said.
So far, the announcement of a total of 120 lottery students over the next five years is sufficient to compensate for the old-age discounts.
The necessary staffing is thus not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board agrees for Group Building
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans to rebuild the Group.
Following the will of Thyssenkrupp Interimschef Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed as Chairman of the Board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis group will be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies are expected to have their seat in food and to be listed at the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff cuts beyond the already known administrative cuts.
After two retirements, the control body on the capital side only counts eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are against it.
However, the final decision is expected to take a major meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is intended to include, among other things, the 50% share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG the business is to be mixed with lifts and supplies.
Barcelona: violence in demos by policemen and Catalan independence officers.
In two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence officers in Barcelona, there have been violent conflicts with numerous victims.
According to the city administration, some 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6,000 independent officers.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protests away from each other with a big offer.
According to the use forces, however, independent supporters attempted to break the security suspension.
They had attacked the officials with color and firing.
Range lines were also reported among the participants of the various protests.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police told me there were six arrests.
Better salaries and respect for colleagues
The police wanted to honour colleagues, who had held their independence referendum in Catalonia almost a year ago against the Spanish central government's ban.
At the same time, they asked for better wages.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is wrong that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they deserve.
The demonstrators felt as a provocation that the Spanish police had shown up in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan Demostrant Manel Perez of the News Agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they ruined us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearicians, who wanted to mention his name only with Daniel, showed back the proposal.
"Of course we want to support our comrades, who did only their duty last year: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is to exercise our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it is a great European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues were "not coming to provoke," the policeman assured.
Panne allowed access to personal data of British Minister
A security accident in a mobile app has led to the temporary availability of personal data by ministers and deputies of the conservative British Tory party on Saturday for everyone.
According to British media reports, several ministers received unknown calls after the Panne was announced one day before the Tory party in Birmingham.

Football: Juve coach praises top party: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese star-stormer "played the best game this evening with the half hour of Valencia", praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) - victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively purchased star was also without its own door of the decisive man in the important party against the persecutors.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and does good," said Allegri.
Even when we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first door - and we grew up at the moment.
Thanks to the three towers of Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early retreat through the hit of Dries Mertens (10 minutes) and hung the worst pursuer first.
The Torjäger, acquired by Real Madrid, first set up the former Bundesliga-Profi Mario Mandzukic, who took care of the leadership with a double package (26/49.).
And Ronaldo also performed the preparations for the meeting of the rebel leader Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who had to move just before the torline.
"There are many templates," praised the coach.
But of course, Allegri also wants to see doors from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese National Team of Records.
"We need to get even better there to serve him," asked the coach.
The best Juve-Torschütze is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the overpower of Juventus seems to be even more pressing.
Seven wins in seven games is the uncomfortable series in the series A. At 21 points, the master of the remaining seven years has already six numerators ahead of Naples.
The tablet range trained by the former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti was not without chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the place reference of Mario Rui (58th) the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to get on too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the square.
"We have played well against a good Naples," said Turner Coach.
Emre Can was also supposed to feel threatened.
The German national player went through Juve.
The professional coming from FC Liverpool was used by all seven league parties.
The middle-field editor also played in the Champions League party against Valencia, which Allegri meant with the "half hour": Ronaldo was fled from the square at the 2nd victory of the tournaments and was blocked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly scrupulous appearance, Rapper Kanye West has taken care of the weekend at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live".
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided for eyebrows and questionnaires in the audience.
The 41-year-old also announced a change of name to publish his new album on time.
Then you can only call him "Ye", so the musician.
"The Being, formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in application to the deceased singer Prince, when he declared his artist names.
However, the pseudonym is not new.
The tenth album already appeared under this name.
In an interview with the radio broadcaster KRL, the artist had explained that "Yes" had a religious significance for him.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "du"," says the Rapper.
Football: Circle A1 Pattern: Final!
Done!
Hoetmars Trainer Averhage did not make a hero out of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was just more aggressive, we put him as well as never before in trouble." Accordingly, the list of hotmar shooting possibilities is read out.
Grade once two Torchancs in 90 minutes, so that only rare games can be positive.
Football-Creisliga A1: SC Hotmar is subject to SG Sendorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first pass, the first but used Mike Krause from a sharp angle to the early leadership (7).
In the 43th minute, the steps of Uphus could have increased, but after great preparation of Krause, he was released.
The hosts had only a double chance as Moritz Höne at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and also found his master at Jan Blome's successor in the Sendhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61.) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) were all awarded.
A treatment meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the torline and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide hit the ball over the line, the party was decided (81.).
"We had been criticizing ourselves before, and that was different today than in the last few weeks," said the Fazit of Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77 Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90 Leibig), Turl.
Gate: 0:1 Krause (7), 0:2 Berheide (81.).
Rote Map: Shortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Circle A2 Pattern: Spectacle football in Albacht: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to keep from," he said.
"We have no access to it." With which he thought it necessary to fly the wings with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green whites that have a collective offensive force.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, bungled and pulled his players on the other hand, the relief that they had pulled with three points out of the affair.
Well noted, after a duel of two teams, one of which, that is, Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fight for class content.
With obviously mixed feelings, GWA-trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was our best season performance at a distance," he says.
"The way we get back after the 0:2, how we've been keeping up with one of the top teams of the league, that was already really phenomenal."
Even worse, it seems that you have to drive home with empty hands now.
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner brought the host with his 12th season meeting to conduct (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this door.
The 2:0 he placed on the left side a pattern for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew it though, but such a player can't hold out completely.
"That was crazy what he had done already," Lewandowski recognized the opponent's quality.
Shortly before the change of the side, his own eleven made the compensation: McGill's left-hand freist sealed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe through to the long toreck (45.).
After the change of page, it was again McGill who obtained the compensation (59.).
Then it went on and on.
It was a dumb, action-loaded game.
Nübel shook the albums again (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69.).
Despite too much, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80th) again.
We now have to focus our full concentration on Wednesday.
"The game against sheep, that's what we need to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolf, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bone (87th Bareksai).
Gates: 1:0 Zimner (24.), 2:0 Frehning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Cloud (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow root: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga Duell between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.
The table guide was actually driven for three points, but the team of Coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and at the end the game ended at 0:0.
Media: Total Bureau of Dynamo Dresden
The entire presidency of the football-secondaryist Dynamo Dresden has dropped according to media reports.
Several media agreed to a joint letter from the Sachsen board in the evening.
There was no confirmation of the association at first.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles in the former federal league.
Erdogan in Germany: Politik Instead of Pump
Good thing he's gone again.

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers some 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
This is why France's president Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he would like to collect the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: he was not president of the Tutzings Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was there for guests.
So he was taken to the Academy Director Udo Hahn, when he proudly said, "All the presidents and Chancellors were already with us." The fact that the Academy in Tutzing Castle was always prominent again was also a theme in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, the singer Konstantin Wecker took part in a meeting on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, on 29 September, the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's president Emmanuel Macron has also promised: he wants to receive the "tolerance price" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which is also received by Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The around 80 meetings until mid- 2019 have it in itself.
"The rent is just not safe!" is in a meeting title.
"SOS at the borders of Europe" - the Academy describes the "risking and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting about Syria: "Barbarai without limit".
Weapons, destruction, torture, death - the war prevents every human idea."
From structural racism in society to radical change of work through digitalization, the spectrum is sufficient.
The Academy Director Hahn was convinced that "a free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions".
At a meeting of 200.
The birthday of Karl Marx will soon be expected to be one more visitor to the direction of capitalism criticism, the other rather a trend "from left-handed to middle".
What does it look like with neutrality?
"We are indeed 100 percent daughter of the Evangelical Church," said the study director Dr. Ulrike Haerkel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral".
Music Cabaret: Gender understanding with Heart - Volbeck - West Fälische News
"Both for adults and for men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Tebner on Friday evening in the hall of the Church of Christ in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret, Tebner presented himself with the gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (sympathetic) woman and (sympathetic) man, but also with music.
The mini guitar introduced her and also mastered her violin.
On the wing, Ben sat on his lap.
He is one of the male sparring partners, who, among them, comes to the conclusion of the sentence, to the other a true pianist: So congealed harmoniously accompanied by Suvrup Tebner that some may have wished for a solo.
That was also true, with Beethoven and Chopin, but otherwise, just as it happened to the red thread of the evening.
There Tebner had introduced a paradox: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but this does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner does not bring any benefits.
The piano solo now demonstrates itself: What would come out of the composition of Mozart, would "the Nannerl" have unexpectedly opened the door?
This is how Sufrüp in improvisations, from Bachs "O Head Full of Blood and Wounds" to the "Song of Death", and from Mozart g-moll symphony into a played dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
The flowers were handed over by Karlheinz Kleintje, the treasurer of the association, the chancenette.
However, the President Heidemarie Markenbeck was not allowed to take any additional thanks.
She had the idea that the duo should also enjoy one in Wolfbeck next to the performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Handball: Women's Landing League: Ahlener SG keeps against TV Wattenscheid near the white West
The Ahlenirs had problems, especially with third-party player Caroline Stallmann, who only scored ten hits.
"In fact, I was well pleased with the defense, only one player has made too many doors.
We didn't get them in the grip," says ASG-Coach Dogan Ayodogdu.
But he was more upset about the many opportunities he had left behind.
The concentration at the end left his crew missing this time.
The ASG therefore lived almost until the end of a remnant, left at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45.).
By the end, the wider bank of the guest pools had become crucial.
In addition, Ayodogdu placed the back room Merle Clement on the left-hand side, which then "extreme clever made the decisive doors" (Ayodogdu).
ASG: Buschkutter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Clement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzzek, Ruschcapt (4), S. Fitzzek.
Volleyball: 3. Liga Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at the VC Allbau Food
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyballers of the BSV Ostbevern have re-established themselves in the 3rd Liga West team.
At the second-grader VC Allbau Food, the blue whites were 3-1.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
This is what we have done now," said Coach Dominik Münch, who was pleased to see his team's almost unscrupulous performance in the stuttered table guide.
The first pass dominated the guests almost by love.
About 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the visitors of the previous year with 25:15.
Lunch has been accepted in the twin line, but has not come into play.
We took good care of them.
Our opponent has taken high risks, but also produced several driving cards.
In the second sentence, the BSV led with 12:8. "Eat has turned the adoption on three lines.
We couldn't hold the pressure.
Eating has grown up, and we've got a bit of a feast," says Munich.
At 18:17 the volleyball girls had the nose for the first time.
Although east-east defenses refused at 19:24 and four sets of balls, the fifth attempt found its purpose.
"The game was now a better class," the manager found himself at the rising level.
Mike Rüdingloh and the final Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV changed the leaf in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Munich: "There we played consistently and quietly".
Over 7:3 and 15:13 the blue-white passage brought four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also won a pleasant day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish municipality: Moschee opening as missed chance
The Turkish municipality in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which the great Ditib mosque in Cologne was dedicated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The Moscow opening in Cologne has left behind in the German-Turkey relationship a shingle hat that can only be reunited with effort," said TGD president Gökay Sofuoglu, the German editing network.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the chance of a common, conceivable appearance.
"On the other hand, Erdogan has used the term for his purposes to underline the membership of the Muslims to Germany with German top politicians," Sofuoglu complained.
The vast exclusion of the German public has "strengthened many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already been established
After the long summer break, it's finally a folk meeting time again.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Heimatverein Nottuln will already hold its fifth Nottuln folk meeting in the fireplace of the Old Amtmannei.
Almost on the day it's a year ago that we've had a public meeting for the first time.
Meanwhile, this event has become a solid part of the musical calendar of events in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, president of the Nottuln Home Association.
I wouldn't have thought that our public meeting was going on so fast in Nottuln.
No matter how stormy Friederike was in January or the heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always full.
"The program is always a colourful mix of German folk, hiking, and sailing songs, folk songs, Evergreens and old battles," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who is always invited by friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has promised his accordion for the first public "Birth Day".
He was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, who played music with flat German texts.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The artists of the People's Meeting recall the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Emsdetten People's Meeting with his international version of the song "Frösche in the Night" excited the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We count with many happy guests to spend a pleasant and humorous evening again," says the invitation of the Home Association.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to actively participate is invited to join.
Since the desired seats are always fast, it is recommended to be there in time.
The public meeting begins at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 19.00 p.m.

From Pure Fruit to Ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stamberger Hall, the 125-year-old existence of the Association of Circuits for Garden Construction and Land Care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show in Kullbacher Association, the last founding impulses were set up for the Kulbach District Association for Garden Construction and Land Care, and just 125 years later, he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulbacher Stadthalle on Saturday night.
At that time, he was free to say otherwise: "As a Bezirksobbeauverein Kulbach City and Land", he was raised from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-building association was also different from today's work - it actually went clean around the fruit-building, about flowers and garden-building at that time, and nobody thought about it.
"At that time, in the era of enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said circuit overseer Günter Dippold in his performance.
Fruit trees should fall off the road, so-called industrial gardens were set up in schools.
The construction is still the task of the 55 garden construction associations in the Kulbach district, which include almost 7,000 members.
However, this does not allow the spectrum to be lost in a far-reaching way.
A natural garden building, biological plant protection, village decoration and food play a large role as well as the media of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
As diverse as the task areas of a garden building association are, the members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" showed entertainingly on stage.
"The youth work is particularly urgent in the digital age," said the circuit president Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed how important experiences in nature were for life.
The Kastanien collection was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can gather with a smartphone & co. like much joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the Jubilee.
"Where they are to stand, the Association of Circles decides," the Landrat Söllner added and highlighted the special importance of the Garden Building Associations for the villages.
The circle association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many gardening associations in the countryside also left no doubt about it, as did circle managers and expert advisor Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with a presentation through the long history of the circle and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
Before that, everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was intruded.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the useful garden turned into a garden of land and living.
"Natural has a stock, it was already there before us and we have to focus on it," the expert pleaded for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, there is a need for the garden building associations not to leave behind so that our home will remain beautiful and vital.
It also includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, the president of the Bavarian Federation, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the exquisite decline in insects, which we owe our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful festive feast, which was celebrated by the Turbulencers of the Thurnau Music Association.

Priority for Nafta talks: Canadian Foreign Minister Represents UN Speech
Mexico's government wants clarity in matters of nafta: they put an ultimate commitment on both trading partners.
The Foreign Minister of Canada is now holding the Trade Agreement an absolute priority and is giving its speech to the United Nations.
Due to the press release of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland moved her speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will speak only on Monday before the United Nations Full Assembly, she told Adam Austen.
In the meantime, they focus on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo had stated on Friday that the negotiating leaders of Canada and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between his country and the United States.
In August, the United States and Mexico agreed to a re-establishment of the Regional Free Trade Agreement with Nafta.
US President Donald Trump pointed out that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks about a new post have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (place time) they are to be brought to the conclusion, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the case of a failure of negotiations, Mexico's designated president, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that he would try to reach a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured by a mass attack, left the hospital.
The right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, after a report in the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his resignation, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will be performing public performances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
At the beginning of September, the politician was attacked on an open road during a election event in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele no" (in German: "The Not") women's associations had especially called for protests against the former military.
In social networks too, the associations made racist and women-regarding statements against Bolsonaro.
A number of thousands of demonstrators were expected in the São Paulo metropolis.
In the capital of Brazil, the protests mixed with the announcement of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the place of former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and therefore should not apply.
The presidential election in Brazil was held on 7 October.
As former mayor of the millionth city of São Paulo, Haddad was in the districts far behind the right-wing Bolsonaro candidate.
The "Trump of Brazil" has long been involved in the political operation, but is again presented as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of elections, there will be a single vote on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not be successful out of this - no matter whom he enters.
Bolsonaro is known for his hostility to homosexuals and blacks and for his conquest of the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He's always shocked with verbal dissipation.
Another time he said the followers of Lula's left working party should be shot.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen shared on Larsen's website.
On the bed of death, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician has been treated since the beginning of the year because of prostate cancer.
Larsen was known to the band Gasolin', which was very successful in the 1970s in Scandinavia.
Their songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as solo artist.
He sold about three million plates in Denmark.
His "Midt om natten" album from 1983 is still the most sold album in Denmark.
On Sunday, Lars Lökke Rasmussen, Danish Prime Minister, praised Larsen as "a street boy", who was "against everything, but in all hearts".
The chief also recalled that the Monarchi-Gegenner Larsen was born on the 70th day of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: Volume at air pressure level
"Here we stand, we take the bones and burn a concert evening with the strength of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonsaw" and "The Ignition" lay such a description of the rock live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the city centre shoe factory: Hardrock pur of three other friendly bands.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no sign of lamp fever.
Then, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the Booking agency "Mosquito" from Olde - are thrilled to see with their bands about 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
The Quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with Frontmann and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to start the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces of their own feathers and the next CD.
Before the stage, the band is danced to the vocal and printed interaction of the band.
Although "Tiger Bonsaw" calls are not to be heard, then leave the stage to the Trio "Here We Stand".
Hardrock is not the same hardrock, with guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at bass and drummer Kai Holscher with her alternative, sometimes in classical rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" the "Here We Stand" also comes to the guitar rock, which is also a synthesiser for use.
Not only is the seductive, just balladish "Take Me Home" exist through the exchange of melodic passages to the guitar-laden rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from the dance houses has since its founding in 2005 played a special level of popularity.
Full agility the band presents its hard print on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" with its performances before a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis on the tour in China of 2017 - has special stage experience is obvious and unheard of.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in conjunction with the band, also puts his own accents on the only night-covered song, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
To the sound that feels even higher out of control than before, Guitarrist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a jubilant solo while running through the audience.
A certain volume of sound is, of course, part of this hardrock concert: At Mint Mosquito's rock night, the sound of the mixing team at the trier concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonsaw" and "The Ignition" is located at approximately 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the level of the press room, but it is still clearly under the control of the "Wacken-Festival", the "Ignition" on its website.
Earwashing 120 decibels in Düsentribute strength as usual for the annual metal steel dichin in the north of the Republic, the Ahlen audience does not need this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the tougher, rock-like gang have convinced them of their sovereign, virtuoso game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bones and burned a concert evening with the strength of a tiger," all three groups, freely in the transmitted sense, can say at the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A fatal accident at Essen/Müllheim Airport
At Mülheim/Essen Airport there has been a fatal accident.
At a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport, a sailplane was crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near Mülheim/Essen Airport there was a fatal accident on Sunday.
As reported by the "West German General newspaper", a sailplane was crashed at the exhibition park at the airport.
The pilot came to life.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the air student was on board alone - in the flighter it was intended to be a sitter.
The aircraft has already been on the landing at the time of the accident.
The detachment site is located just close to a stop at the airport.
But since this weekend, an October party will take place.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the edge of the city of the two Ruhr districts and directly on the trip to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a park&Ride offer at large events in the dining fair or in the Gruga hall in Essen.
Trump lifts Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that North Korean President Kim is completely well-founded despite the nuclear crisis is not a secret.
Now Trump has made his colleague a regular declaration of love.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president announced a new flame.
The tragic: It is a remote relationship.
In all public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love on Saturday to North Korean powerman Kim Jong And.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old Sprout of the ruling dynasty from Pjöngang, although he proved to be quite close to the nuclear suit in the ring around North Korea.
"I was dumb, he was also, and between us it went and here," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim had caused his heart to melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also brought political fruits: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and rocket tests announced by Kim, even though critics have seen little more than lip recognitions.
The fact that the affection for the "Rocket Man" who announced his death threats - so Trump's name for Kim - should not be held accountable to everyone seemed to be fully aware of the US president.
In any case, he took the criticism that he expected of it when he appeared in a large track hall of the city of Wheeling immediately: "Donald Trump says they've fallen in love".
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpredictable.
But he took care of it very little, Trump explained and directed his finger to the multitude of people: "I have always told you it's so simple to be president."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there who would push the full arena into this arena, but we would have only 200 people out there.

Refugees Thanks to video saved from Libyan prison
Nigerian refugees have pointed to their catastrophic prison conditions in Libya by means of a mobile video and thus enabled their salvation.
The group had turned the recording into their cell in the coastal city of Savija in July under threat of life and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said one man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alarmed the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
Finally, the refugees fled to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we might not have been able to return to Nigeria," said Ephe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to get across the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he took his own statement to risk his life.
One of his allies was nearly tortured by the guards to death, said Onyeka.
In general, the prison conditions were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary return of refugees who are beached in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes this year using the program, the IOM spokesperson in West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians now rescued is not unusual in view of the bad prison conditions in Libya.
But he hasn't heard from a phone video aider yet.
International organizations have been criticising the state of the Libyan refugee camps for a long time.
The North African state, which is dominated to a large extent by militias, is the main country of transit for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the People’s School on Sunday afternoon to prepare her Monday teaching, she surprised a burglar.
At 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the courtyard of the 1st floor, she saw a man running straight away.
Only through a door, then through the roof terrace and from there through a ladder into the ground or the front seat.
The teacher understood the police who took the investigations.
Whether things have been stolen or money has not yet been said.
Actor description: about 16 years old, black, quite short hair, somewhat darker look, dark pants, dark T-shirt.
Please contact the police inspector Obernberg am Inn, telephone number 059 133 4244.
German had been caught in his own car for so long.
A 75-year-old has had to wait several days and nights in his car in a woodland in central France after he fixed the car off all the forest roads and blocked the car door.
Rescue forces discovered the Pkw on Saturday afternoon by accident, not far from a herd and release the missing persons since Tuesday night, the police reported on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reportedly in spite of the cold nights and the long time without care in good health.
He agreed to look forward to his home now.
The tenant was reported missing by his family after not returning on Tuesday from a ride with his parking car over the local meadows and fields.
Despite intense search efforts, the remains of the man remained unclear for a long time.
Laschet warns the rule of law in Turkey
In his interview with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Mr Armin Laschet (CDU), President of the NRW Minister Erdogan, called for legal status in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries were currently "overestimated", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns, in particular, the wave of arrest, the freedom of the press and religion.
He therefore made it clear at Erdogan that if relations are to be normalized in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important condition.
Laschet also referred to the cases of Germans who were in prison in Turkey, according to his own statements.
He has formulated the expectation that freedom of opinion will be respected.
Erdogan then again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
The conversation of Laschet and Erdogan was moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence in Cologne Airport in the short term.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at the Wahn Castle - but the inmates had refused to do so out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan went on to open the Ditib Mosque in Cologne after the conversation.
Laschet had neglected a joint performance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact points - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the United States: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of stressing the success of North Korea's negotiations on denuclearization, the Ossetian regime represents the conditions more delicate.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for a meeting of Washington.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has proposed to block negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The most recent state is therefore that the United States is building on forced measures that are deadly to confidence-building," Ri said in New York.
A suit for North Korea is inevitable under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," said the North Korean diplomat.
The fact that North Korea's criminal actions could be forced to "knee" is "a dream of people who don't know us".
In order to build trust, however, his country has stopped its nuclear and rocket tests and destroyed an atomic test plant, Ri moved forward.
On the US side, however, there were no "reactions" on this, the ministers criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the UN Security Council decided three times last year on sanctions against the international isolated country.
US President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo in the past days in the United Nations insist on strict compliance with criminal measures.
At the same time, the US government is working towards an approach.
For the first time in June, Trump met North Korea's captain Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the President of the United States is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will again travel to Pjöngang to discuss the end of the North Korean nuclear programme.
The HoT is served: New kitchen with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting, of which the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing with: White blankets and flower jewelry on the tables and a large buffet waiting for the guests after the resurrection service.
The young people of the HoT were delighted to have the buffet with deliciouss from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the municipality, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves for the food.
It was not easy to start with the new facility, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had already filled our refrigerators before the summer break with food and ingredients and were well prepared on the big day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a power crash had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was ruined and had to be taken care of.
"Now we had to start from the front: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to create it alone," says Westbuer.
And that's how they all got together.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"It's better not to cook," praised a visitor, while Hokkaido basket soup was served or the guests were allowed to serve Quiche, liver cheese or cakes.
"It's really great what children and young people have put on their legs," said Fr Frank Beckmann, while Zauberer Stephan Lamben with cartoons and other pieces of art for surprises.
Jürgen Sator leaves the National Board of NRW
From hunger on criticism from their own ranks, the boss of the Essen table, Jörg Sartor, has given up his posts in the country association.
Sartor had become widely known because the Essen table had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had already retired in July as Vice-Chief of the NRW tables, Sartor said of the "World on Sunday".
I've fallen too many in the back.
The head of the NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-term representative.
The sharp criticism has taken Sartor.
"I can follow his step - there are people who did not know exactly why the dining table does this."
But Sartor was still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, there's nothing going on," said Weilerswist.
In the "World on Sunday", Sartor criticised colleagues from other tables.
You must not pursue the approach "without us starving people in the city".
It is the task of the State to ensure that people do not starve.
At a conference of the tables on Friday in Berlin, the Essenes did not participate.
"I'm told too much sweet dirt," he said.
There are all of these social vulnerabilities that have criticized me at the time.

Gladbach plays two-time leadership - chess without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach has to wait for an outward victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first season victory (1:0).
(sda) Four times Schalke has maneuvered himself into the first five league games with early opponents.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco again added those strengths on the day that it had put first place behind the Bayern during the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf brought the home team in the eleventh minute after a strong pre-work by Jewgeni Koopljanka per head, followed by the hosts to preserve the minipolster with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund again welcomes from the top of the Federal League.
Lucien Favre's team had negotiated a 0:2 stand for the break against Bayer Leverkusen, but in the 2nd half time it was still a 4:2 win.
Jacob-Brun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) are equal to a double inside four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63th minute, provided with another double in the final phase (86/94th) for the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart was the first to win.
Against the yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic already decembered worth of Bremen before the break, the Stuttgarters had to bend in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the unmistakable Goalie Ron-Robert Zeiler manufactured a beautiful design owner that brought the guests to compensation in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely happy but also a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The gladbachers with the Swiss Quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang twice gave a lead out of hand, last played 2:2 and are still waiting for an outdoor victory in the VW city since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's compensation to 1:1 Renato Steffen was responsible for his second federal league.
On a 20-metre flat shot of the Aargauer, Yann Sommer was powerless, as was the second encounter after an hour.
However, the trends at Gladbach are completely uplifting.
Alassane Pléa appears to be a goalgetter in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase coming from the OGC Nice met for the third time in succession and for the seventh time in the seventh duty.
After seven rounds Gladbach will establish the fourth place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeatable worth of brakes against the VfB Stuttgart took place in an uncomfortable position.

Although Stuttgart Defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zelier brought the brakes back to the game by a curious design owner (68.) a quarter hour before the end of the game, Gonzalo Castro shot the most active Stuttgarters back on the winning street.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereignly for itself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens took the home team through foulpenalty already on course.
Macedonians agree on new national names
In Macedonia, about 1.8 million people today agree on whether to change the name of their country in northern Macedonia.
In one case, the nearly three decades-old conflict with neighbor Greece could be resolved.
Athens had remained on a name change because of its same-name northern province and blocked every approach of Macedonia to the west.
The voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could become a member of NATO at a positive outcome of the referendum.

SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs married his friend
Almost a year after the marriage entered into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two gave the Jawt.
A registered life partnership was not questioned for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" section.
"If we get married, then we're right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a spokesperson for the SPD Federation and one of the speakers of the Seaheim County, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Federal Day debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs took a close look on 30 June 2017.
So he had proposed to Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to have "stopped" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in response to the accidental announcement of the DDR threshold opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, homosexual couples have been able to marry just like Heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to enter their lifelong partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the law of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters hectic cut
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the Children's Association and the Leprakunde Society.
Because about 400 meters of hedges should be cut around the gardens of the inhabitants of the friendly house.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce the costs," said the president of the civil society Walter Schröer.
And I've collected some of them.
Because of the hot summer we're late this time, but luckily it's just a form.

"Yes, we should all stay with forces," Walter Schröer said.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner holds gold at the Kanuslalom-WM
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal in Rio de Janeiro to complete the Kanuslalom World Championship.

I was well-prepared, I had enough rides on this site and it's been all right today," said the London Olympic Third.

Luckily, the killers failed.
The days become shorter - that's what breakers want to make use of.
So yesterday the police inspector Gauting mentioned the first attempt to break up this fall.
The fact that it was left at the one-family house on the King's Way is due to the alarm system.
That was when the workers put their hand on Friday just 20 hours ago.
The offenders realized that the residents were not at home.
However, the alarm was apparently surprised by the fact that they took the escape without delay.

Pleite at Hertha: caught from reality: Bayern v. Ajax requested
The predicate is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin wants the FC Bayern "not to fall".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate phase for Niko Kovac's term of office.
The first small part of the new Coach Niko Kovac will never increase to the larger spring depth for the Munich.
"One week ago, you still had the impression that we were invincible.
Now we've got a bit of a reality," noted Thomas Müller after the deserved 0:2 down at Hertha BSC and asked for a reaction for the Champions League duell with Ajax Amsterdam.
Whoever knows us knows that we're really upset and that's why we're going to gas on Tuesday.
For the first time since more than a year outside, no door has been shot by itself, as at the same time of the preseason two duties in series without winning, the table run in the football league lost first to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the end stage of the damaged Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the recordmaster has to be warned.
The FC Augsburg, at 1:1 with its running male anti-man tactics, and the Berliners, through their playful needle stick over the outside, have delivered within three days two blowouts, as the last ones who appear to be powerful are to knock.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we'll do everything to make us successful again," Kovac stressed.
On the other hand, he and his losers in his hometown were surprised to see his first defeat as a Munich Coach only at the once again incapacitated treatment with chances.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday before the country’s play break would still make the first intermediate phase of his office seem positive - otherwise the sound may get worse.
Thus Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before the second stage of this season after 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday begins as planned the short preparation for the second round game against Ajax, which had also sovereignly forced AEK Athens to launch with 3:0.
"Now it's got us in two games, but we're going to make our doors again," announced Captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost podal finale against Entracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich Putett spoke mainly.
The lawyer acted as a mahner.
"I don't think it's all bad, we need to work it out again, because we don't make a lot of chances and make mistakes," stressed the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh playday of the previous playtime, even the Bayerns were behind Dortmund with five counters, which now took over again with a point of preference.
And so Kimmich valued with a eyebrows at least positive that now the public debate on the alleged unbeatable Bavarians has ended.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's a good time for the league.
DFB-Boss in Schussline: Özil-Cousa: Hard Attack of Erdogan on Grindel
With heavy proposals, Turkish President Erdogan launches an exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
Although DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, he defends the alliance line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the dignity of interpretation in the permanent theme of the dispute Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticised the relationship with the former World Champion in Cologne to open the big Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB Chief of Staff defended the alliance line.
On the early Sunday morning, the personally attacked Grindel of Özil announced the consequences of the case in the Mainzer ZDF "Sportstudio".
"In the future we have to draw very precise conclusions that this does not happen again - because we also have many players with migration backgrounds in the U teams -," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without migration background as other integration officers.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and DFB.
In sharp words, this had raised a racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
We were born in Germany and raised in Özil and our Ilkay.
They have separated them from this society because they were able to take pictures with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the capital.
To be honest, I couldn't say as her president that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that he felt "appreciatively treated by the DFB" by photos of the two of them with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he wanted to face players in the future.
That someone says, "If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm Migrant - that's not happening.
"That he has such an impression, I am very sorry," said Grindel.
We'd have to defend more at the moment, I've always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for returning Özilis to the National Team.
As a result, an additional integration officer will be appointed alongside the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If a person with no migration background clearly affects society and football and says, "The topic is important, we need to take care of it," it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the site where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the WM-out and the Özil affair, he wants to run for the office again in the coming year as DFB President.
"I do my job and try to make it as good as it is," Grindel said.
Yearly build three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the accident on Friday between 10 a.m. and 13 p.m.
The 75-year-old driver was first addressed by a lady on the red lamp in the area of Lauter's height.
She told the tenant he was driving against her car.
However, there was no exchange of staff, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady on the parking lot.
A short time later, a telephone message went to the police about a driver coming down from the street and driving against a driver.
On that point, the man did not want a police officer on the spot and then ran away from it.
After that, the Rødtaler went home.
However, the tenant has been in his place of residence, where he has been living for decades, operating and changing a vehicle.
Finally, the police could find him and stop him.
His car showed significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a wrong impression and couldn't feel much anymore.
The damage is around 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Still almost 1000 use forces in use.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a federal defence site in Emsland, 980 operational forces are still involved in the destruction.
This was shared by the German army on Sunday.
As the situation continues to be stable, 70 honorary helpers have recently been withdrawn.
Another reduction in the number of use forces is planned, that is.
On the night of Sunday, an Upper Earth fire was discovered and destroyed.
Last week, the disaster was lifted, which was well known a week before September 21st, because it was feared that the flames would endanger forests and settlements adjacent to the wind and radio flight.
On Thursday it was said then that an overcrowding of the fire on adjacent municipalities was no longer threatening.
On the spot, over 1500 use forces tried to get the big fire under control.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the federal defence ground at Meppen with a transport screwdriver.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Federal Defence.
For the 2nd and 5th October, according to the Bundeswehr, clear flights with "Tornados" are also planned again.
The fire was triggered by tetrakes that had fired Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand was temporarily taken up to 100 kilometres across the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the German defence will set up a response to the damage reports.
The first claims for damages were already announced by hoteliers and holiday owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs married his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharin in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost a year after the marriage entered into force for all, the politician married his long-term friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost a year after the marriage entered into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two gave the Jawt.
A registered life partnership was not questioned for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" section.
If we get married, that's right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a spokesperson for the SPD Federation and one of the speakers of the Seaheim County, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Federal Day debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs took a close look on 30 June 2017.
So he had proposed to Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to have "stopped" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in response to the accidental announcement of the DDR threshold opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, homosexual couples have been able to marry just like Heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to enter their lifelong partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the law of adoption.
The referendum in Macedonia began on new national names
In Macedonia, the upcoming referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state began with excitement.
Around 1.8 million voters will decide whether their state will be called in the future North Macedonia.
This is due to its so-called northern province of neighboring Greece.
As a means of printing, Athens had blocked every approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO for nearly three decades.
If the citizens agree with yes, they will also give the start-up committee for the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting

Switzerland starts electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and to relieve family members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can still only be taken with express consent, says Swiss transplant.
(dpa) Switzerland starts an electronic register of organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and to relieve family members in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes are then available in case of need of Swiss transplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs - as in Germany - can only be taken with express consent - stress Swiss transplantation.
It is estimated that 15 percent of Switzerland has a donation certificate, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases a card will be found at the crucial moment at possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the people do not know the desire of the deceased.
"They then have to decide, in the sense of the deceased, what is often very burdensome," said Immer.
A similar registration system exists already in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the health card, as the spokesperson of the Federal Health Clearance Centre, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
"There is no register in which people can register their wishes - pro or contra organ donation - there is no one," she says.
Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn has voted for a reorganisation of the organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be regarded as an organ donor unless he or his or her relatives object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects it.
14-year-old student is world champion in the head
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in the world.
He spent the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 rivals.
Martina Flamme-Jasper shared this from the Phaeno Museum of Science, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel from Germany placed the third place.
The youngest WM participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest 74-year-old pensioner from France, as Chief Justice Ralf Laue said.
The IT professor from Zwickau (Saxon) organizes the competition every two years.
For example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since viewers were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, with participants coming up against guests from the audience with pocket computers.
Wenzel's greeting from Lastrup demonstrated how he keeps a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Welcome to Bielefeld two years ago as a 14-year-old.
With terms like superhero, genius or wonder child, organizer Laue can begin little.
"He can train," he said.
Many participants spent several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even accounting competitions targeted at stadiums.
For example, the square root line consists of six-digit numbers.
In terms of diversity, candidates are given the surprising tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans had good chances, the Chief Justice said.
On the other hand, Asians are often in advantage because they are already more intensive and effective in early childhood.

In a subsequent CT, blood clots were discovered in Serenas Lunge.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans a clear extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-Blue Coalition will send an appropriate bill to the so-called "Symbol Act" in consideration.
This will clearly expand the number of terrorist or comparable groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings to the mountains in the western neuschnee
For the first time in the West, Mrs. Holle is shielding her beds: Polare Kaltft reaches the Montag Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg.
According to the Meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit decreases at the beginning of the week to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it can be cut down to about 1,000 meters by strong intensity.
From the Bregenzerwald to the High Towers it is estimated to be above 2,000 meters with 20 to 40 centimeters of snow.
On higher passways (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Height, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauren, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions are therefore winter.
Farmers may start on Monday with annual Knickcare
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start their annual Knickcare on Monday.
The unique "green whales" in Germany have been marking the landscape of the Walderman Federal Land for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide tree and grapevine branches are "walderset" and for many animals and plants the last retreat spaces.
Knicks connect as a Corridor located living spaces, over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as said the managing director of the German Nature Protection Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living teeth
The Knicks were questioned on the basis of a command of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living columns" were not only field limitations and pastures, they also supplied the farmers with fuel wood and beams for their trade houses.
From that time on, his name "Knick": Through "Knick" the aces were able to develop the densely flowed boundaries.
Today, between the North Sea and the East Sea, about 45,000 kilometres of the Hectics are extending the image of a woody, multi-structured landscape.
According to NABU, about 7,000 species are currently used as replacement living space.
In a kilometer of Knick, they could live up to 1800 different species and break up to 30 pairs of birds.
Its ecologically important function, however, can only be fulfilled if it is maintained in winter.
In other words, he cares for a light tree line that also incorporates the wind protection effect in addition to the variety of species, Ludwichowski said.
In accordance with the information provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, Knickcare may only be carried out outside the Bridging Period from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesiaer talks about the situation on site
In the interview with the editors Network Deutschland (RND), the native Radika Pinto describes the situation on site on the island of Sulawesi after earthquake and tsunami:
Were you on your own during the Tsunami?
No, at the time I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
There I arrived on Sunday morning, because after a flight I had to drive more than 20 hours since the airport was closed to Palu at the time.
How is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be entered.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that were completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also occupied other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many are referred to surrounding hills, where they are still afraid of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they do not have access to water and food.
Some stand up in front of their houses, there are still imitations.
Because many food shops and even tanks are completely closed, people are partially gluing food and gasoline.
The public service is completely undermined, and the national government is helping.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are partially free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are lost.
How is communication and information provision running on the island?
At the moment we received a phone call, but before it did not work, and we only received information about the radio.
Many people are still searching for their children, neighbors and other people, of whom they do not know whether they are living and where they are staying because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but were on their way to work for example.
The Tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information about that?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the alarm came, many thought, "Okay, no tsunami," and then he came.
In other regions not affected by the tsunami, there was a lack of information that a tsunami hit the region and they are referred to the surrounding mountains.
Isn't an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Fire ring prepared for earthquakes?
But there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We normally know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure is broken down, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: VfB must for a long time ignore Aogo and Donis
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
At 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, Aogo pulled a muscle fiber rice in the back left upper neck, the football leaguer shared with him on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bonding rhinestone in the upper jaw.
Both players are definitely no option against Hanover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss even after the next country game break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not provide a forecast for the expiry date.
A muscle blender rice usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber rice usually heals somewhat faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebastian Film Festival
San Sebastian - With the film Festival of San Sebastian, the rains of the most prestigious European festivals are closed annually.
All gorges on the cinema can be summarised in spite of this: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.

Biathlet Julian Eberhard plays the WM-Medaille
Place four at Olympia was Biathlet Julian Eberhard long in the stomach.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to trace the missing precious metal at the WM in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympia print of Pyeongchang the one near the medal to catch.
Seven tenths were missing at the end of bronze.
"I have allowed myself time to process this," Eberhard says at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his home city of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn't want to be.
So much more motivated is the Pinzgauer to trace the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back with the constitution to a big event to win something.
Sometimes you have to hit it too.
The WM-Loipe in Östersund (SWE) is located in Eberhard: "I've already closed the track in my heart", he recalls with joy at his fourth World Cup slot in a single race in the previous year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the world Cup winter in Kontiolahti (FIN) mass start-up competition.
With the staff he lived in Oslo (NOR) on rank two.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in Turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of planned acquisitions is severely limited.
With an FBI investigation at the Turbotempo, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the high-level majority for the court candidates who are in dispute because of the requirements.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for the investigators to clarify the necessary events that are more than 30 years behind.
The latest turn in the drama about the calling of Kavanaughs accompanied by a cultural struggle was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, in which, in the course of the case, there was a riot against the opposition Democrats, the Senate's judicial committee should open the way for the final confirmation of the conservative judge at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly stated against his original announcement that he would agree, but requested an FBI investigation.
His party's friends were allowed to do it after a stormy scene.
President Trump, who still referred to the heavy maintenances on Thursday as "Beschiss", first included further attacks on women and spoke on the contrary of "happiness in the accident".
In this way, the last doubts could be resolved, he said.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats in an election campaign because they denied Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy".
Trump ordered an FBI investigation in the case of Kavanaugh
The White House has also severely restricted the powers of the investigators.
A government representative told the Wall Street Journal: "They don't go on an angel trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses should be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the town municipality of Ried for monitoring the Tempolimitis is stationed on the garden road, according to the city municipality from Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The city community also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on chess is great after the first season victory.
However, the factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football games.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball inside.
And there were many corners and many balls in our chest," said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and sighed.
Finally, however, it was still the king's blue to bring the barely 1:0 against the Rheinheses over the time and thus bring the first season victory under the roof and field.
It could have been different.
After leading by Alessandro Schöpf 11. the team of Chief Trainer Domenico Tedesco had given security, Tedesco said: "In total, the first half was good, both playful and pressuring".
Create not a headball memory
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," Heidel said, "if the team was only half as nervous as I was at the bank, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands, so they kept retreating.
And defends men and mice against Mainz.
To save the first three figures of the season.
"We all have fallen a huge stone from the heart," said the Creator, who had no significant part with his ball match: "I am actually the worst ball player in man."
But in the end, it's only the victory.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start printing in the beginning phase and make a firework out of it," Schalkes Chefcoach said.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, quietly and courageously, so we have to deal with parties over 90 minutes
Perhaps the biggest manko of the afternoon: King's blue missed it rather for a clearer relationship to worry.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example through the strong Yevhen complyanka, which twice met the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have become a victory," said Tedesco: "You've already felt a bit of fear."
That's why I'm glad we won.
So he wasn't the only switch.
Fishbachau: Smoke column in Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke wasn't to be overlooked.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker in Leitzachtal observed a fire on Sunday at 1.30 p.m.
Now, the police are investigating.
Fishbachau - The cause found police and firearms soon out: An unknown person had set fire on a two-square-metre area at Gschwänner Berg Müll.
According to the police, it seemed as if he had been watching the fire for a long time, but then left the glut unattended.
And that's close to the forest.
30 Fishbacher firefighters were involved in the separation and destruction.
The police are now finding out about firefighting.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on eye height
The author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani, is standing before them.
He is followed for the repeated invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I've been tasked with bringing interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and president of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - the association that cooperates in the direction of the evening with the "Cultural Policy" alliance.
El-Mafaalani goes up very slowly in the reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in a understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, hand-held numbers and some joke, he brings the listeners one of the most controversial themes: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts occur despite successful integration?
The Syrian author serves in answering the question of a metaphor.
On a table, the German society, on the Katzentisch, is the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat on the big table and want to agree now.
That leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether to join the political right or to the left, but rather, "Am I for or against an open society?" he stresses.
First of all, the round of discussion is going on more and more.
And there's a need to talk.
A Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, telling two teachers how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani is present, not on stage, a picture of the discussion: it is on eye height.
The sociology professor does not insist on his opinion, stressing that he speaks from the average, not from individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because "first, when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the next hour of signing, he also continued to have an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in Foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities.

Construction in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is obviously huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the property in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening sold the first plots in the newly built area Landsham-South on the free market.
This is shared by Mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase is completed for those 20 plots that offer the municipality with more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the previous home model.
Good 100 applications have been received, so Frick.
"The documents are currently being examined" with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to Plininger Mayor, the aim was to have the candidate ranking list for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to present them to the municipality.
Then the forgiveness can be made.
A total of 50 plots for single and double houses are created on the southern area of Landsham and four areas for multi-family houses with an estimated eight units each.
The resolution is now as good as finished, and the roads and roads will soon be asphalted.
A single plot as well as two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Plening.
It sells most on the free market, 20 plots in the social model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family homes of the municipality are to be built as a affordable living room.
A total of 16 apartments supported by the Free State.
Place for 200 people
Grave is estimated to be created on the surface of the New Landsham-South living room for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, early October, according to Frick, there is the start for the new construction of a childcare facility.
It is intended to accommodate three groups of children's gardens and three groups of shrimps and a multi-purpose space.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019 for the beginning of the next year of the kindergarten.
So Schalkes Naldo "great sport" also succeeds at the bank
For the third time not in the starter: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks to Schalke-trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time, not in the Schalker Startelf, but in the exchange bank, the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two-metre Brazilians had spoken so correctly of the hunger of the soul.
But when the Schalker players, after the 1:0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05, gathered as usual in the middle circle and thanked Chief Coach Domenico Tedesco at all his professions, the 36-year-old, named all the simple half-salt Naldo, said, "We have to thank Coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed reservist design, did not hold any groll.
It is likely that Naldo, who was celebrated as the best switch in the past season, knows that he has actually not been on the landing track with his coach - but has been given a break for good reasons.
A reason called load control.
It wasn't easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him that I'm telling you so honestly," said Tedesco about the moment he said Naldo that he wasn't in the beginning.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," Tedsco reasoned.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that all can now get through.
And that we all keep on the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation that has recently also won Naldo.
And the Brazilians responded to the wisdom of his advanced age: he also proved himself a exemplary champion at the bank.
The mood in Austria's industry continued to accelerate its speech in August compared to the Eurozone.
The purchase manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month step.
However, behind Ireland and the Netherlands, Austria has the third best voice, the Market Institute reported on Monday to its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro area's SMEs increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, thus the index is still under the 50-counter brand of growth in the 13th month.
In August, Ireland's only industry hit this threshold with 50.9 points.
Finally, the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, however, slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level with 44.0 points since March.
"The slightly weakened speech could mean that the worst is overcome," said Markit-Econom Rob Dobson.
However, the industry remains one - in the third quarter anyway - growth brake number.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: the export orders in the euro area have been as strong as since November 2011.
The companies therefore completed the seventh month in subsequent positions.
Also in China, industrial production fell stronger in August than at first.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had expected 47.8 points at first.
The purchase manager index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
These include developments in turnover, employment, stocks and prices.
Tuchels PSG team succeeds after victory in the eighth league game
September 29, 2018 at 19:45 a.m.
Nice Trainer Thomas Tuchel runs with Paris Saint-Germain in France's Football Championship from victory to victory.
At OGC Nice, the title champion won two matches of Superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was successful in the eighth league.

The Brazilian Neymar brought the PSG into the leadership after 22 minutes and ended in the playtime.
For the intermediate 2:0, Christopher Nkunku (46.).
Thus, Paris also achieved the general test for the leading second Champions League team game against the Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
In order to set up the royal class, at 2:3 in Liverpool, Tuchels team had to take up the only mandatory play in this season.
