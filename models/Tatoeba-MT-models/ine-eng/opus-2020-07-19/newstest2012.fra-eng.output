Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
As part of an amendment to criminal law, the Ukrainian Parliament rejected the draft annulment of the paragraph on the charge of Julia Tymosenko, the head of the opposition.
In the second reading, Members rejected the draft amendment aimed at reducing the penalties for economic offences, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently in prison.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for concluding a non-priority agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must decide on the appeal of the convicted person in December.
Tymosenko called the regime's political revenge judgment and led to a process of bias of the court also to the west.
The proposal to cancel paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 Members.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libya's victory
The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already won.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to determine the winners.
As is customary in the region, the winners of the elections are Islamists, but they are moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the ordinary law of Charia and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a crime-free country because for a flight we cut hands.
Women can forget the emancipation, the possible non-respectives of her faith are passable from the capital punishment...
It is the Koran that will unite in place of the dictator's personality the society made up of opposing tribes.
In Libya there will be such an order that we cannot represent it and that we certainly will not love it.
But our way of life is not unique, it's not objectively the best and it probably wouldn't be beneficial for the Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamic warriors have accepted help with the recognition of unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it is not an American general who was leading NATO strikes, but rather Allah, whose greatness they celebrated at every attack.
So when it comes to finding the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We participated in the shootings, serving Islam, and our politicians turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any benefit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militaryly engaged in Libya.
There is therefore no problem for the premises to get rid of "crossed".
Is it that the oil companies will have easy access to the Libyan black gold without the occupation of the land?
Perhaps not so much as the West may eventually boast of uninterested protection of human rights.
Little by little, we're being prevented by these chariac fans.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the eyes of investors.
A tornado of statistics was spent Tuesday on Europe.
Each of the states published relevant GDP information for 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The mandatory market beats all the records.
The investors not only look at Italy but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistics offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have published earlier their economic development visions for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, France's growth by 0.4%.
Both countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better placed than expected (growth of 0.3 per cent instead of 0.1 per cent planned), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (i.e. the origin of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent during the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated, and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, it is confirmed that it is heading towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than the forecast of analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% during the third quarter but stagnant during the last quarter.
The German economy had a growth of 0.5 per cent in the third quarter according to the planned and recalculated data periodically.
The euro area economy and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, corresponding to what the analysts had planned.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
Ten-year performance is 28.45 per cent
The performance of the obligations of Spain and Italy is now increasing to critical limits.
Problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
The performance of the Czech obligations remains below 4 per cent, while the situation in the region worsens.
Votes are heard in Germany to say that the ECB should be the last guarantee .
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won at Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The performance of the football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to Super Czech and Guardian Petr Jiracek 1:0.
The Czech football has also defended a good deal of chance in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualification match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a great deal of chance for the second.
The Czech representation also won thanks to Super Czech and Hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its qualification at the European Championship.
The Montenegrins were under pressure until the second part due to a specific Czech defence.
The winners of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who ran two chances of marking a goal.
And thanks to Super Petr Cech, the Czech representation will not be absent from the European Championship next year, and also a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football box.
In the first few minutes, we played a football warrior.
The two teams were difficult to get together and the game focused mainly on the central line.
The pressure of national footballers did not escape the Czech defense that responded precisely to the long shots even during the first half of the time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a human shield
A few hundred high school students created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli assassination.
The students went to pray in the afternoon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Ispahan created a human shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technology centre of Ispahan where uranium is transformed.
They thus openly stated that they would defend their country's nuclear programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has found in its latest information that Iran has not ceased to strengthen its nuclear weaponry.
A possible attack by Iranian nuclear institutions is reported in Israel.
The students went to pray in the afternoon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose objective would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, targets would be not only Ispahan, but also Nathanz's site where uranium is enriched.
Feeding an obese child: don't take a little breakfast and take from the charcuterie to eat it
Over one third of children between 9 and 13 years of age have overweight problems, 9% of school age is higher than average, and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families who have a poor lifestyle.
This again shows the importance of the environment in which the human being and the models surrounding it evolve.
On obese children's tables, for example, there is 50% more charuture than in children's families at normal weight.
19% of obese had dinner fries according to the survey carried out with a sensitization action "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In the small families, sport is also not a habit, which is now the case for most schools today - only 15% replied that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last year of school and attended 900 primary schools in Cheque.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", action supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from the sixth to the third have been enrolled in this project.
One of the determinants that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight children, even obese, is the absence of proper and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the children in question indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day small breakfast in case - breakfast - tasting - dinner, which is a basic principle of good food," says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and breakfast.
Experts draw attention to the fact that some basic details such as a small family lunch at the same time are needed to develop healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of the families of the students eat at the same time.
In most families each takes its own breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that's been discovered is that a tenth of the population doesn't take all breakfast.
However, breakfast is the basis for a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in obese children's families, there were more frequent consumption of malnourished fries.
Almost every student - without talking about weight - drink sugar every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children in question do sports regularly, but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food
Another part of the survey has enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food from the possibilities proposed according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children from 12 to 15 years old are far from ideal for healthy food."
Among their favorite dishes are many cakes, meats and sugars.
"The most alarming is, in particular, a great preference for sugar lemonades," the results of the investigation are indicated.
To eat it, these are the pasta that took the first place just in front of white meat.
Children did not want any feculants and the preference for fish and vegetables meals was very low.
Head of Health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the time they receive the ad hoc information.
"In the course of a review of a group of participants in the survey who had filled the questionnaire after the awareness meeting "Obsity is not a coincidence", a determined determination was made to go to a healthy diet," the results of the survey indicated.
For example, the most striking thing was about sweet lemonades because children started giving preference to drinking water.
Children were most often left on the questionnaire with white meat and fish as main dish and would reduce sugar and "knedliky" (Czech specialty of bread flour or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals say.
In a presentation on how to learn for the stylists, I was a little upset at the fact that there was a lot of it from the beginning.
I didn't think about what was going to happen next.
The exhibits of three professionals in the specialty, character training and a seminar on what's going on.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we get to the final exams and the more we look forward to practical exercises and information.
And even when there are courses Saturdays and Sundays, it's really "bourished."
This time we have with Director Alenka (in the course there is no boy) treated the way to dress the woman who has no standard measurements.
And women of this kind are the majority.
One has a small tail, the other one a boy's body, without a particular curve, another of the superweight.
The stylist must know how to visually reduce large arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We have thus come to emphasize the character beautifully and also not to dress too prominently of women's types such as Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a fine size.
For example, if there is a difference between the size and the hips in such a way that the skirts or pants do not go through at all, it is worth the effort to do so.
And you won't regret it, because the clothes that fall are unestimable.
In a measuring skirt you will feel much better than in the one that always slips, wraps and does not hold to the belt and so on.
For those who have a male appearance, a Tucker-style clothing can be allowed, with cloth pieces, or embroidery.
Of course there are many examples of different appearances and I am happy that I have all week to select all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that you will consider what I have to do at home too much.
Each trainee receives a celebrity to dress for the day and the evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality and its appearance.
I'll have to "dress"Miranda Kerr, which maybe you know about Victoria's secret campaign.
At the bottom of my mind, I am pleased because it is better than wearing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost 100 pounds in recent times (don't take my statement, svp, completely serious) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the Internet, print and work on graphics.
The Moodboard, as it is said for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with the graphic creation.
Meditating on the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist does not only wear the physical but creates, for example, the productive pages in the magazines (on products given trends for handbags, blankets, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, a stylistic and graphicist, has kept us from all this.
But that, until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three special guests gave a diverse look at the Saturday meeting with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with one dress in a different way.
The variability is for this primary example.
For example, this strip-coat that must be worn in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat, but it can also dress the naked body, with scarves and take it in a photo as a dress.
Or it is enough to lift the sleeves or neck and have a new look immediately.
"Play with it" he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You can then begin to oppose it," said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why we are trying to learn these rules, what to do with, what to do, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have much more variants of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is, for fashion story that will have a dozen pages (so a dozen models) I have to be ready to "retail" at least a fifteen.
And also, a clothing and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We have to deal with this in the course of creating a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half of the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
It is enough to look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing made it a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylistic services remains cold.
And the familiar faces sometimes view them as useless (it's enough that I know something but what I look like goes to the second rank).
And if someone makes a styling on our part, then we have to count on the fact that he tells us with a great probability a completely different size (lesser) than what he actually has.
Then we just go on google and make sure that the boulevard information tells us about the celebrity in question, whether it's fat or fat, etc.
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to go in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he wears and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing to be human, not to brag, to keep his opinion.
"When a manager asks you to choose his armor and fill it with new elements, you can't throw everything away and tell him, "My God, how terrible."
"You'll find some things you'll find pretty and he'll advise you on what to wear," Mario said.
This one has specifically shown us what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or stylistic bag.
That's what you stick around the size and you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to the things clearly defined as scarves, depilation rolls or even food spikes, there is also the nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or caps), special clips with which a garment is closed in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of agraph are not usable because they could wear the garment) or a sewing kit.
So that we were not only people who listened but who tried something practically they taught us how to look properly at shoes.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the seed could fold, to the fortiori to the left.
And so we got caught and caught.
We did not have the right to touch the scars so as not to hurt ourselves by inadvertently.
So we really need skills.
Mario made me happy when he congratulated me on my creation.
The count I make is not for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second week of the course
I'm starting to understand more and more that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone says what they want.
The need for speed Le Run fights across America.
Revision
At the origin of a problem-free race is transformed because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift to work.
It fills everyone's ambition to some extent, but it does not serve anything if no one wants to do anything more.
The new sub-title The Run has produced great expectations before its exit.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old Need for Speed race series and to get out some kind of game from the playable parts that would not only match points.
So we were curious how the routings will be during which the main hero is out of his car and does what he wants.
As already in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole pulls down due to some unnecessary errors that have existed for several years.
These are not really errors, but rather the expression of an incomprehensible phenthesis on the part of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You're involved in the adventure that Jack's main hero has in character problems and to solve them is involved in illegal races across America.
You're sitting behind the west coaster in San Francisco and your mission is to get the first one in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The itinerary is divided into ten steps and then more than 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on another route and the steps planned in different environments that distinguish each other quite well and are interesting.
The player doesn't feel the only moment that the game offers him something to identify.
Some environments are rather beautiful, even though the graphic technical level is the same as the previous series.
It's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in high snowy mountains is very pleasantly visible.
The tests are increasingly time-enhanced with an atypical element.
For example in the desert you will find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you must be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
On the other hand, the different races are well organized behind each other.
There's only a small number, but that's enough.
There are moments you try to surpass the requested number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you run against the watch (classic duel with the chronometer) and then you still expect another duel with an opponent.
From time to time, you also have the police who are in the game and who are trying to make the situation difficult for you.
Newness is the passage out of the vehicle.
It's rather an interactive animation when most of Jack's time goes out in front of someone and you have to help him by hitting the right button at the right time.
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
What is surprising is that there are less times of this kind than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
As a result, it is as well as this because this element is not likely to generate and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that enhance the game.
The model of conduct is in the tradition of previous games.
What it means is that there is nothing extraordinary at present but it cannot be said that it is negative.
As for realistic simulation, you will have to go elsewhere.
But even if you can find the model of conduct better in competition goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So it's okay.
Problems start to appear after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collisions are not yet in progress.
We don't expect this game to be a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you don't have a collision with any object, the least idea of how your car behaves, it's not completely good.
During closed crossings you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car is part of crazy volts.
Or he's in my house.
It's not really a problem, but it really upsets you.
The recollection is made so that when you have broken the figure or you have gone out into the decor the game brings you back at the last point on the itinerary.
But you only have 5 recollections.
When you have used the 5 replays you have to restart the game from the beginning.
So it's more a tool, in case something doesn't happen as it should, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes the refurbishment does not help and the solution must be found by remembering the part of the journey in question.
The great goal of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that need to be passed in a certain way or not.
Otherwise you will meet on a given location of "civil" vehicles in the same configuration as you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute in delay.
What makes you angry is the situations when you see easily passing the opponent between two cars coming in reverse direction and when you arrive, you must either turn aside and twist them or slow them down.
It's the same if you go ahead of him because it's "calculated" so that for the given situation it always gets close to your nose.
The opponents still have other advantages.
During all the time of the game, you, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This angers the most at the end of the game when you roll on a long reverse bridge.
The opponent must pass before you at any price.
When it passes in front of you it hides the sight of other vehicles in reverse direction and you get into collision a lot of times.
It can be understood that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of addressal, but it is clear that you are quickly bored.
And it's bad because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and the places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that's going on.
And it's the same if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there's no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is to change the car during the race.
You must pay attention to the gas pumps on the routes because you can change cars there, however, most of the time you have enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, big American cylindrical cars for the right highways and super sports cars for exotic finders on very technical routes, for example on lacquer roads in the mountains.
And the way of challenges, which are races in particular places you know about the adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest driver level, various objects begin to open:
It connects online with the Autolog function that compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult hits to understand is the situation of the last adventure race.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you are in the dark on the roads (it looks like).
Your speed indicator indicates you between 150 and 200 km/h (priority) and behind you comes a subway branch that sends you the car directly to the railway.
At the drafting we had a discussion for a few days to know whether someone really thought about when creating this game or whether the authors really take us for imbeciles.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally nice and in some cases really great.
What is ghastly is that in more extreme situations, the image does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This is especially true of accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid image is no longer used to you.
The sound part is good and the track is at the choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the young public a new soundtrack has been created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confused.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that it's about the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game makes it feel like it's not over.
The fun is really good, but prepare to get the wrongs into your eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.

Vice-President, Ambassador to the European Union:
The Czechs act as negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically abolished the balance between the institutions"
"I didn't expect a war as hard."
"This will take 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role," said Miléna Vicenova, who started her presentation at the Faculty of Law of the Czech Embassy near the European Union.
When she was able to describe the various bodies of the EU and their relations in such an understandable and visible way that a large number of speakers from the Charles University Law School could send her a message "understanding and openly about Europe" to the point where she took her motto seriously.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, the criticisms that he is tired, that it is a round-the-clock, that he cannot fulfill any mission, and I must say that he has cut the blow to everyone because he holds his role to perfection."
"It is a man who can listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them, and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of a response to the question: "Who is in the European Union?" "What phone number should I call?", so as an important step towards the unity and greater legitimacy of the Union's state policy, such as China or India.
No one wants to forbid us our syrecky (sweet-sweet straw that feels very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda she has lived, lived and will live in close proximity to the European Council.
She qualified the Czech Presidency two years ago.
The Czechs have resolved the financial crisis, the gas crisis, or organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It qualified for the fall of very negative governance and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is now very busy.
According to Madame L'Embassadrice, "the activity has fought its full"not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve itself now.
The new seven-year budget of the Union must also be approved, which is very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it would appear that the budget will be small and for the sake of savings, what sector will be the priority, which countries will be most assisted, at least, is all to be resolved in future negotiations.
The Embassy recalled its slogans with which it arrived in Brussels "For an understandable Europe".
"I really don't like the abbreviations, the foreign words, the jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand that it is true that no one in Brussels makes round or round corners, or bananas that are quite large or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky."
It wants to make better use of the EU's environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A Europe at several speeds awaits us
According to the Embassy, the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspects more than positively.
It is also sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault, according to it, results from several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and little support from the Czech party.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, it then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Polish, the Magyar, the Slovak, this French says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is still doing this Visegrad group?' and it's not very happy."
In the near future, according to Madame Vicenova, these are new tough budgetary policy rules that await Member States.
It is the concept of a Europe at two speeds, if it is not at several speeds, but rather a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and other countries outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute for Enhanced Cooperation."
First, it was said that the countries that wanted it and those who didn't want it would cooperate with them."
"There will be a lot of institutions of this kind and there will be a really two-speed Europe," awaits Madame Vicenova.
From this point of view, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the bases on which all the issues affecting the EU should be discussed between all EU members and not just the Eurozone members.
History of a brand:
Innovator IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone was to look for the vocabulary that most closely expresses the IBM strategy, the closest one would be "the long term".
For a large audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, it is a strong feeling as very current and yet since its creation it has been 100 years.
This long-term strategy was based on the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved so little that people are willing to think.
Its slogan "PENSE!" has become the printing press that will develop the life of a future giant (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
It was the basis of the company's culture carefully developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements towards the future.
IBM has survived for hundreds of years because it remains loyal to its basic values and yet has not been afraid to change everyone else around it.
This has enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more"the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano took place for the anniversary.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, took care of his employees as Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only first U.S. employees to have paid holidays, an employer's insurance paid more an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and traders.
In the same way, IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The company was at the very beginning in the discovery of talents - as one of the first firmes to have abolished all forms of discrimination and could thus have the choice.
The current plan is fully in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy as it will be a woman- Virginia Rometti - which should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
It has been working at IBM for thirty years and currently holds the position of Chief of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years IBM has done what is called the jamy, the online brain-storming based on what are many future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - in the firm there are almost 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that provides it with a secure position in the business field.
"Since the beginning IBM had an institutional concept rather than a technological firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Economist at Harvard School and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve business world problems by using its technology," Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research added.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or "Grande Bleue", as she calls the United States familiarly because of its slogan - has grown up to become one of the world's largest firmes.
This is, of course, the most polyvalent technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, accommodation, council services at the server's product level to nanotechnology.
It has many patents from all American technology firms and five of its employees received a Nobel Prize.
Among its findings are the ticket distributor, payment card, financial swap, bar code or floppy disk.
IBM met this year with $220 billion as the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded in 1996 Microsoft.

This is not all the innovations and manufactures that have preferred the client and the time - IBM for example has failed the peer on a own OS/2 operating system, the Prodigi online service or either the IBM PCjr computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the forward movement you can't emotionally stick to the past," notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this, IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don't work it goes on.
In contrast, for example, to the Microsoft competitor that is on the base and remains under the Windows operating system.
A Perspective Technology
In IBM incomes, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a prominent place.
However, in 1990 she was with more than the strongest representative of hardware.
Starting in 2000, IBM sold low-performance assets for $15 billion, and in this period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
It continues to invest, even from 2008, when it for the first time exceeded the new financial crisis.
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who also increased its investment volume during the great economic crisis.
Did it appear now that IBM is going through the current crisis without being worried?
The price of the IBM action has increased by 120 per cent since 2008 and the net profit of the company continues to grow.
The logo of the firm IBM is to change everything but not its values.
We can expect this flexible giant to control other crises.
History of IBM: From cheese strips to flights in the cosmos.
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it initially had the complicated name of Computing Tableling Recording Corporation.
It was named IBM in 1924 - originally a brand used by a firm's branch in Canada and South America.
The basis for the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 1980s of the ninth century.
They had technologies such as the old "points", the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 presided over the Society's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then made the founder of the firm a shadow - it's about Watson's ideas that so far rely on the identity and culture of society.
Watson ran the firm until 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - cheese and meat wraps up to registered boxes.
During the first four years of Watson’s leadership, the number of business increased to $9 million and the company’s expansion began in all parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of management it was his son who was taking over the manager's chair, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, the people and computers of IBM assisted NASA in leading flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
Between 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to take care of advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded in IBM in the last three years - is the concept of Smarter Planet "a smarter planet".
Its aim is to smartly exploit technology in areas that have not yet been exploited, such as urban transport and management.
In the area of trade IBM has recently developed a smarter trade platform that helps traders manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in our territory.
It created its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country of Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing centre of Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe Centre is located in Prague, and there is also the world-wide research and development team responsible for the recognition of the word.
Rýttarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep this year, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richtarova (53 years) said, it's over!
After his husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years) became body keeper and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come back home, but not as my partner," Rightarova explained.
When Darina Richtarova gave summer asylum to Bartosova in her home, she had no doubt that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta insists on moving from Ricany after 30 days, Pepa does not reject the singer.
And he said in public that he loved her.
With Darina's time she resigned, she accepted her husband's connection and ended up saying goodbye to her forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rýchtar and Bartosova separate, there will be no wife to welcome her on the steps of the door of the house.
"This is the biological father of my son and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost old ane, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," he left to filter Rightarova by showing that she separated from her husband but that they only remain in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed her door isn't a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and I won't change."
"My wife has put in place a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we discuss completely normal but we don't sleep together" said Rightar for Blesk.
If Richtarova finds a new love, he won't stop it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she goes, with who and if she has a connection.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta and I take full responsibility for myself," Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: Does this concern you too?
If you ask men to determine the typical vices of women, all, like each other, are able to get them out of their pit.
My dear ladies, you will meet in the following lines of the female vices that come to pump the blood of the men's veins.
Purchases
Your half makes you notice that you're dependent on the purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one dress a week?
Are you happy to buy packages at the time of the balances?
In your case, we can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think that they should limit their passion for making purchases.
But you'll say, which would resist the vitrine laxe of clothing shops, to look for yourself of beautiful clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women to buy it is a hobby, it can become a real hell for man.
Just remember how many times you told your mate he was waiting for the entrance...
Dissatisfaction constant
"I'm not too big"?
"I would need to eat at least 5 kilos - should I start doing sports?"
"Do you like it?"
These phrases don't remind you of anything?
Yeah?
So you're part of these women who are obsessed with their appearance.
It is not the question that you should stop worrying about yourself, but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that more the frequency of these complaints increases and more women become poisonous.
The first place of the house and the purity
It's like an infinite handle.
Wash the windows, go through the vacuum, clean the floor, clean the dust, clean the bathroom - and that's twice a week.
You make notes to your partner that he walks with salty feet on his own floor, to the children who have come out of the washbasin, scratched the glass of the living room, and what does that give you a lot of work?
In case you are suffering from this obsession, try to remember that there is nothing to be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be the first place in the family.
However, this innocent desire for cleanliness can damage your relationships and even family peace.
The work of soap
"With this surface used in the trash."
"Are you going to put those old shoes on tomorrow?"
"A wet maid has nothing to do with the ground."
If you do this know-how work on your partner several times a day, you're really going to decompose it.
It's obvious that you don't think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much soap work...
Diffamation, Persiflage
The defamation, persuading, but also the insults against someone are also the property of certain women.
Women are particularly involved in relations and thus are happy to deal with issues such as, where, with, with, how and why.
Maybe each of us can escape a little harmless perversion here and there.
The hand on the heart, however, is a particular feature of women.
But the worst are those who advise, perceive, even despise others and are for their surroundings - especially at work in a community of women - especially dangerous.
Jagger and Voracek helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
The hockeyist Jagger has twice participated in Philadelphia's victory during the NHL's game Monday on Caroline's ice and is again at the head of the prolific Czech players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who has even made an extra pass and has been named the best player of the game, he marked in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jjar, also recorded two goals during the game.
Jagger after the match told the extra-Atlantic journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a big night.
"I told him before the match he'd give his hat-trick."
"I heard it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you," explained Jagger after his action Giroux marked a goal of the first shoot of the Flyers.
A moment later, there was a second attempt by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricane goals for the pallet and presented it to the Maxime Talbot switch.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the beginning of the second part belongs to the Flyers.
Especially in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagger he marks three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transforms a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the best three," Jagger said about his center.
"I never thought I'd play at the end of my career with a hockeyist like him."
"I'm really happy about that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years in NHL the other players of the team have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," Jagger added.
Caroline made a play of this game because with a purpose of Tuom Routu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot it ends with a difference of purpose.
Matt Read didn't get away with any other complications that ended up two against one.
"Proger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He tapped on the pallet, I took the speed and (Read) left to the farest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," said the last goal of the match from his point of view Voratek.
Philadelphia came with this victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montréal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he came out in the second third due to an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candians did not face an experienced defender of their two goals lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
This is the fact that the back line was sick, which mainly embellished the local coach rather than lost points because they played the match only with 5 defenders.
"It's zero."
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were young people."
"But there's nothing to do, that's how it is," says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement has not been enough and we have not been able to resist."
"We just had to simplify the game, push the palette out of our area."
For this we had limits," added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender took part in the 30th Winnipeg attack and victory on Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated in Uax goals of the Jets, which ended a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel mainly in the countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holiday in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then the regime began to have a tendency for the west and travels to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not permitted for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the socialist countries.
In the case where the Czech Republic wanted to travel individually, for example in Poland or the Soviet Union, it was necessary that a letter of invitation be sent to the Czech Republic if the individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered to travel to the West, however it was necessary to make the tail all night with a sleeping bag or to have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that, it wasn't won yet.
The agreement for currencies that was the condition to travel west was refused to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not interchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the currency agreement (western currency) to travel west.
The Czechs spent most of their vacations in the country where there were, therefore, many homes of campaign and chalets that the Czechs had bought, and this habit is still hard.
Since 1989 the Czech travels have seen a great revolution.
Although up until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were maximum, last year the Czechs spent 4 million days abroad in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we do not know today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because part of Yugoslavia of the time.
The removal of visas in the 1990s in the neighbouring countries of the West caused a huge wave of short-term visits mainly in Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not travel by plane to the west for a long time that everyone wanted to see for at least one moment.
For example, in Paris travel organizations slept the Czechs in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical trade of a Czech trip was at this time to bring with it its own preserved food, sauces, etc... to save.
Another important moment has also been the exchangeability of the Czech crown which has allowed our tourists finally after decades of free purchase of Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average wage increased what led to another important moment around 1997.
As a result of a growing demand for travel, travel agencies have been preparing tours with air charter connections since 1997 that have greatly reduced the costs compared to what was before.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had unintended connections with practically most of the developed countries around the world outside the EU, which later facilitated our journeys.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared for an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as every year of direct air charters take Czech tourists to the distant warm countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU deleted visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to participate fully in the group of developed countries.
In 2008, the Czechs also spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) for the first time in history more than 15,000 crowns per person for vacation abroad, including the accompanying charges. Crowns per person.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this may end with a situation without a solution "a pact"
Nearly 5 months already the Czech football is without a President, and he risks that Ivan Hasek's successor at the head of the Czech Football Association is not yet known after another General Assembly to take place in Nymburg on Thursday.
However, there is still no agreement on what voting rules must be made.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paklek are interested in leading the Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and in the course of his departure called on his colleagues to join and find a strong personality that will lead the football in the future.
Only during the summer after Hasek did football come back to differences between the rooms of the Association that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly gathered in vain at the National House in Prague because the negotiation was blocked and it was not even a matter of dealing with the way to be elected.
There was no agreement on knowing who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, like, the statutory representatives or also the officials invested in full powers.
In this single point, there has been a partial agreement since now with the assistance of the State and Law Office, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences continue with regard to the electoral regulation.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which, in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not done anything to the situation
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the neurologic point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into bed.
"The apple of the dispute is as follows: either to proceed in accordance with the statutes or to find another model," one of the three vice-presidents of the Association of the Football of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda, which represents the professional football in the association.
According to the rules of the proposed model, the third round will be won by the candidates who will have received the most votes in percentage in the room for which they are candidates.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to withdraw to win the candidate who will have received the largest percentage of the two-room votes.
And the Czech party examines the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentages of vote.
"Only then would it lose the idea of two previous tours and would completely reject the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits, which understands the objections of the Moravian party and which would best not change the regulation and vote in accordance with the existing statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees, even if he considers that the election regulation is the most beneficial of all candidates in Pelta's Statutes.
"I wish to vote to the maximum in accordance with the statutes of the Association."
"Because there are not yet any holy ideas imagined by a representative as in the previous General Assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations was especially defined against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymbruk, there will be a new President and he believes candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The possible qualification today at the European Championship should calm everyone."
"The football will again be on a path of happiness and there is more training for cooperation" adds Jablonec's officer, who among the three has the greatest experience in leading both professional and regional football.
Rachel is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravas, but there are trends to want to change the drawing regulations."
"This can lead to another blockade at the General Assembly."
"I hope the same as the healthy reason will win," said Rachel.
There is not much time left for a common agreement to all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro, but which can say whether the entire football management will be complete for the game.
The specially trained flight to Podgorica, among other things the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rijkl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take a part of the executive committee on the ground of reprisals.
Finally, it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister of Education for Youth and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the parties that are derogated from the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot of: a state-of-the-art allocation, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Union of Sports, which must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Palik is fighting for the President's position because he does not see any proper candidates.
If the leader of Plzen Tomas Paclik's footballers had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to all he requested for a new President of the Association of the Czech Republic Football (AFRT) he would not be campaigned for this high function.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not present myself to the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," Palik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Palik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rijkl to try to prevent Pelta from joining the AFRT head, which would be given priority for this election.
Paclik also stressed that in the event that he would win the elections, he would hold this position as President only until 2013 scheduled for a General Assembly.
He'll be well in function an experienced and high-level manager who's not connected to the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he said.
"For me, it was terrible when some people told me that they didn't want to be identified with the Czech football at the time."
"I'd like to change this image," he added.
What is said, particularly Palik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Union of the Plzen Roman Berbr football, a man who is known for his controversial reputation as a lobbyist who is able to influence the vote of delegates to the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable for Pelta to hold this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing in the football again."
"And with Berbr's support, which is a high-voltage dealer, it would be even less favourable to football," Palik proclaimed.
What is still shocking is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago in the course of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta was released without any penalty.
"I don't know which prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA" says Palik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the Plzen club."
In the event that Palik triumphs in the Thursday vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rijkl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly in September that had ended by a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to go with him."
"He's got great abilities."
"It would be able to present itself, for example, as head of the representation."
"But as the manager of the Association it wouldn't be able."
"I don't put the nose in what I don't know," said Palik, who in September attracted great attention when he voted for the annulment of the Arbitrators' Commission with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Palik claims that he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to lead private companies and that he has also been leading the Plzen club since last year that celebrated with his support in May his first division triumph.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring some culture to it."
"I would slow down the influence of some interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, leading to situations of bad taste," Paclik added that he did not seek his antipathy for the head of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
He would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose power to lobby high-level policies would allow for more money to be spent on gambling tax.
"It is one of the key points the new President should address."
"If this is the gambling tax, as the political parties have said, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Palik does not make his current connection to the Plzen club as something negative even if he himself claims that the President of the AFRT should be "above the parties".
Pelta is again connected to Jablonec and Rachel with Dukla in Prague.
"It's not ideal."
I see no reason to pass on my actions from the Plzen club to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later," Palik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT which should put an end to the state of emergency.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Association of Football, one of the candidates to the presidency, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, the AFRT would have new statutes that should put an end to the electoral regulations in the future.
Jablonec's official is ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and thinks that the success of the football performance today should calm this battle before the vote.
Pelta, before the September election that was not held, just promised to devote itself to national representation and to obtaining financial resources if he was elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the General Assembly passed, and this two-month delay could well enable him to defend his vision of the football leadership and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have played football for a long time and expect Thursday to have a president."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the leadership of the Association," he added, but he is primarily linked to the Jablonec club, has worked for many years in Sparta and the Union Executive Committee.
This is also why he has enough experience to run the Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the election there is an euphoria that ruled at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly of Statutes were approved which were not perfect as they were all seen."
"If there were not all these different interpretations, we would have already had a President since September," says Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civil association that took all the attention of the delegates.
"If I become a President, I take it as a personal mission and I am ready to take all the responsibilities if this does not work."
"It's a principle without which we can't exist," Pelta added.
Then he tries, we say, not to confront his opponents.
He previously stated that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rijkl that he recognized his training in law and that he knew accordingly that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice President.
He hasn't attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, which, on the other hand, doesn't stop criticizing Pelta.
"He's evolved into football for a year and has already had some success."
"His attacks, however, were not more honorable and surprised many during the campaign."
"That is also why some have doubts about his character now," Pelta said at the address of her opponent, but he said, faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest-level competitions to the national representation.
It's supposed to be a football comedy.
"And I would also try to finish all the cases that start with that of the Bohemians or the result of the corruption scandal."
"I would enter immediately into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we could get enough money for the whole football," the Czech Press Agency CTK announced the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment at the head of the football would not lead to any change in people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he told Strahov where he had a understandable nervousness since there was no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for anything.
"If there is only one point on how to vote on the third round, we will be able to overcome it."
"The football needs credibility and it will only get it when there's a new leader at its head," as Pelta optimistly states two days before the likely decisive day for her career as a staff member.
Rijkl promises that under his direction AFRT would start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rijkl was elected as the new President of the Czech Football Association to the General Assembly of Thursday, that would not please a large number of people, it seems.
However, Rachel promises that in the case where he would be elected we will start working hard.
He wants systematic changes and makes members of the Executive Committee responsible for the various areas of football.
He also promised to regulate the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work initiated by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I want to take care of football in its entirety."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a performance football for youth."
"But I'm not saying that I'm going to do all this alone," said Rachel in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member takes care of a specific area."
"And I will distribute difficult missions to make football a big step forward."
"Many people will not be happy because it will start working hard rather than criticizing others" he added.
He said that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if this is worth the shot and if I have people behind me who will put me constantly in the wheels and throw doubt on each of my actions," explaining why he hesitated.
"Many people have even told me that I must not give up because they would also give up."
"It's a trust I can't betray," he said.
What motivates him, we say, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"Since the last two years there's been a great deal of work and I don't want to let it fall."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would like only someone to stop them."He said with fear that in the case of Miroslav Pelta's election, the situation within the Union does not come back as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and that's something Mirek Pelta can't do."
"After him there are people who would do football in such a way that it would be only for those who were chosen."
"We can blame me for a number of things, but I'm sure we can't stand something."
"I try to be a target."
"I want to do football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen
And he once again confirms that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if anyone says otherwise, I'm ready to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division will be divided into two parts by one Czech and the other Moravia, the winner of which will be the first division."
"There would be no situation as at present with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, President of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rijkl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I always feel the support of the Czech House that has elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successes," said Rachel, who is considering among her future successes saving tens of millions of crowns on unfavourable contracts, negotiations on contracts with televisions and on the game law.
On the contrary, the fact that the Association is not united is a common mistake to all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech footballer would lose his credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Palik is a strong candidate who has what to offer at the football.
"No one can doubt that Plzen has done a great job this year."
"If he had been elected he would certainly continue in what Hasek started and would not make a significant change among the people in the Commission."
"He didn't want to miss his success," said Rachel who evaluated his rivers.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
A spit in the blue
De Julia Stanek
Ovni-optimized pathkeepers, magnificent Budapest swimming pools: Who travels across Europe can live her blue miracle - and after having turned the city or made a long walk - can let her legs rest tired in baths of gas.
A book shows in which swimming pool you can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the last 18 months, there was an object that should not be lacking in his luggage: his bathroom.
Stretched on her back in the water, she observed the artisticly arranged dome, and was swimming against the Putten marbles that were waiting for her on the other side of the pool and was not lacking to admire the Art New Metically restored from these converted swimming pools.
If a covered pool pleased him, she noticed in her book all the worthy details of interest about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the Meder architecture history and presented them in its already published book: "Badefreuden" (Bain Jewelry). Munich's municipal swimming pools, the historic bathrooms in the black forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a real fan of the bath culture.
Meder, explains that she does not have much interest in sports, but she feels attracted to water in a completely different way.
It is annoying that swimmers should be happy to contemplate blue flags and accommodate Javel's water weight while the players breathe from the scent of epicéa forests or can listen from the gaitly of the park birds.
"I asked myself one day why the pools must always be so deserted," said the vinnoise.
"So I started a collection of beautiful bathrooms."
Water surface doubles architecture
A swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - a factor of well-being in the swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders were to give themselves a little more pain, the swimming rooms could be a real delight to the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a water surface in the swimming rooms."
"It is on one transparent side, but it reflects on the other side the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces appear in a double way: high joints, multicolored straps, trampling.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes a good report of 190 pages of interest on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly gives a desire to make a splash in the blue.
The Meder collection found remarkable copies during its research in Hungary.
Alongside the beautiful well-being baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing water in a natural cave in the karst (a cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a bath of spas with water containing alcali and (Városios Termämfürdö in Jaszberény) and in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the air-heated swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Zürich bath you can see the whole city, you can admire the Arlberg curved from an outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton: The Turkish bath has a window from which you can see the animation on the ski trail.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Langenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like an OVNI that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, the steam rises from the three open platforms, while in the background the mountains of Otztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of Javel water does not flow from all pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths produce a smell of sulphur, of the Arpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be found in a health spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon glues you to the skin as soon as you let you slide into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool and in the air of Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricade ground.
The bathroom designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was immediately closed.
By striking a glance at the New Art building window in red-white-jaune, she observed the expansion of the bad grass between the squares.
She observed a different effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad's thermal palace.
This building has already survived three phases; not only can it be discovered from its design in 1844 but another Alhambra-style wall room that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace remains the favorite bathroom of the expert in the pool, Iris Meder - and not just because it is from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a great performance to sink so different construction styles into such a formidable unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, swimming in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural speculative
The German bank examines in detail speculation on raw materials
De Christian Teevs
Does the German bank leave its speculation on the raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the group leader then wanted to draw on the consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the point is clear: According to one study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable for banks to speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions stop this business avenue because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Force survey on the order of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the speculation of Stock Exchanges on global raw materials moves prices upwards and that banks share a complicity to global famine.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically directed against the chief of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act the same way.
Speculation on raw materials was originally introduced to protect the goods from price fluctuations.
But most experts at the same time share the view that the partners have withdrawn from the offer and demand - and benefit from the costs of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently from US competitors: He promised to investigate the complaints and said, "No case is worth putting into practice the proper reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the Foodwatch-Report charges.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank's Board of Directors must be presented - with a recommendation, as usual.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann built on Image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation on food price increases shows in a particularly dramatic way, to what extent today's banks are of general interest."
Ackermann is the first bank lobby to be particularly required today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all the investments in its portfolio for which the money was invested on food speculation," Bode said.
"That matters little, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it's hungry people or whether Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may appear to be surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the group's PDG wants to present a perfect image a few months before leaving its function.
The Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the President of the Board of Directors will not change anything within the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with the abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation.
And as for any loss, he has little to worry about - his successor will worry about it.
One of the two would resolve the investments on raw materials.
Foodwatch is trying to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
To date, more than 30,000 netizens have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Tuesday survey, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Just eleven percent found it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments for which payments on food prices are made.
Many bank customers would also have a personal impact if they learned that their bank was involved in such operations: one in two would resolve, following the survey, all the investments for which money is injected into the speculations on raw materials.
43 per cent of such banks were disengaged in their surroundings, 49 per cent replied that they would reflect on the resolution of their accounts to change the banking facility.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that moved
Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and fell into ruin.
It is now reopened and is held at the exhibition house.
If one is excited about a modern post-war architecture, for its clear forms, its glass hangars, its vivid and bold allures and its new construction materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was previously awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its construction in steel and glass, light and suspended.
Construction is considered to be an important step in contemporary architecture to this day.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the following Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW house and its adjacent ball-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became famous at the international level in 1973.
His project as temporary construction had been exposed after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the southern Vienna station, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - not walls to bend the works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it has been used for so long, until contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become increasingly depleted.
At present, architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, he now bears the name of the 21st century Maison and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday night, the Belvédère Museum opened, where the house belongs, the first exhibition - a chance at any point of view.
The new start was carried out well by Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new guide in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvédère.
Husslein-Arco, who promoted art historians to a considerable career, among other things in his youth as an artist, then at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as the founder of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, has led particularly to the work of transformation with political men and the protection of monuments, has obtained public funds and private sponsorship and has established them.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exposed there, a coffee and a library are found there, and an office must be built there.
Close monitoring, small budget
Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter for the realization.
Not only because he had transformed and sensibly expanded Joseph Olbracht's secession and had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen the exhibitions "in practically every weekend".
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which was lost in generosity and lightness following his move to Vienna and his change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: "the building was "a hole in energy", says Krischanitz.
The profile of the glass façades windows was changed, the glass insulated in glass fibers was placed and the roof replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges were reinforced or replaced, and the metal-filled coatings were rehabilitated.
Two sub-soils have made the place for the new operation, a light panel jammed between the house and the road ensures the lighting, a bridge leading to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but always light Pavilon Schwanzer.
The outer doors of origin have remained, the house is painted in a tent protection against the red-black wheel.
And the cinema room is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for the monuments and with a small budget.
"Sometimes materials that are good and low-cost were to be found, and that also enjoy the office of monumental protection," Krischanitz said and he drew attention to a gross underground soil.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "who came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if this is a chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden, the newly planned "town of the Central Station" is just standing up, with offices and apartments.
And another chance may happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the reinforcement of another construction Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art centre, and as he says, it already negotiates with the city to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
The train plans a typical winter crisis in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
That cost millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million additional this year in this regard.
The "Bild"-Zeitung daily reported to the preliminary by referring to an internal crisis plan for the group, that investments of around EUR 300 million would be planned by 2015.
This should also allow for better availability of vehicles and the rail network in the event of extreme emergencies.
The number of internal and external employees for the refusal of railway installations and of which should, among other things, double and pass to 16,000 people.
The aim is to clear the snow and ice ranges until the start of the service phase and 90% of the road equipment required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, the Head of Rüdiger Grube Station warned the government and industry at a conference at the top of the train accidents that occurred this winter.
The last winter the railway company has had enormous problems for the transport of users, because it lacks reserves, among other things, in the event of difficult weather conditions.
This is how many new regional trains have been waiting for years to be authorized by the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has been doing what for years, since it has to check the axles of the ICE trains significantly more often at the workshop, after a break of the axles took place on an ICE in the central train station of Cologne.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the United States.
After the case of Chief Joseph Ackermann there is again in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine amounting to millions.
As if Deutsche Bank's problems were not already sufficient, the past of this sector's giant also hits the US: the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (EUR 106 million) to resolve a dispute due to the failure of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The financial market regulator NCUA brings a series of accusations to the large banks, which should have encouraged cooperative banks to make false promises regarding the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents have lost considerable value during the financial crisis and have led the banks to the bottom.
"We are pleased that we could have found a solution to this issue without the parties starting a trial," said a spokesperson from Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank did not admit any mistakes in comparison.
This is also valid for the Citigroup, which committed itself to paying $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and is involved in bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to repair the damage caused by several billion dollars.
The comparisons now concluded are the first in their kind.
The regulator also took out other large banks and in summer he was assigned to the JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As regards the issue of mortgage documents, it is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are at the base.
When the American real estate bubble exploded in 2007, This was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events are already dating for a few years, it is now blowing a storm wind on American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have sought many remedies to obtain compensation or to sanction deficiencies.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) triggered the biggest wave of complaints.
She blames 18 major international banks, both of the US real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for having benefited in nature in the case of mortgages of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to apply to FHFA, which is several operations of a total amount of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities ask that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but without mentioning a specific amount.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the applications as unjustified and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
WARREN Buffet increase of 10 billion at IBM
Buffet, the financial governor, invests enormous amounts in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has purchased shares for a value of more than $10 billion.
Until then, U.S. major investor Warren Buffett explains constantly not to invest in IT computer companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only shows bad forecasts.
However, he read IBM's reports and changed his opinion on investment in this sector.
It had already come to understand much earlier that IBM is mainly offering services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered to be an attack on the world of finance.
Therefore, the IT IBM activity is granted the right to call now "Munsir IBM".
Because Buffett has today revealed to the CNBC economic issue, which he has purchased since March IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway thus became a large shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM has never known anything about this commitment so far.
He welcomed the leadership, which, even during the economic crisis, had provided reasonable benefits.
"You did a great job," said Buffet strategically.
IBM has for some time put on IT profit services as "exploitation of accounting centres.
The computer pioneer, who is over 100 years old, also offers software and consultation as well as very effective business computers.
Buffet had so far prevented technology companies.
He says that he invests only in companies that he understands business.
But on the contrary, Buffet is attacking the iron frez, lubricant manufacturers or machines.
Its holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as parts with a whole range of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Rüd munichois.
This 81-year-old octogenary had taken over in the 1960s" the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company and raised it in the ranks of one of the world's most prestigious companies, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That is why it is a figure of worship for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of winning money was worth the nickname "Oracle d'Omaha".
After Buffett's investment announcement IBM's shares increased by one percent to the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", as also called IBM, has a stock exchange value of over $220 billion and counts with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, he says he doesn't want to participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the Zwickauer cell, the Turkish media suspect the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "blood ideology", which would be reborn now.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extreme context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population react with fear and concern.
Because for many Turks, the spectre that we thought had died long ago reappeared: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there was no longer any violence comparable to this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
If there is a xenophobia in Germany, there has never been a question.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has been detected reveals proportions whose size is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to bloodthirsty ideology," "This was the title of the internet release of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" stresses that one of the authors would have been a V-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the extreme-right boulder.
It is reasonable that the Turkish community in Germany responded: it called this weekend a silent memorial to the victims of racial violence in front of the door of Brandenburg.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It is with gay colors that the cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a story of success.
The reports of some Turkish media have an effect: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Thus, the German paruture of the "Hürriyet" does not prevent itself from drawing on unique conditions.
"it begins with boy," Tel is the title of Ahmet Külahci's chronicle.
He stressed that people would have been murdered, paid taxes and would have made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany by their work.
The action of the police was seen in a very critical manner on German-Turkish forums, and they had subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why has it not come to the German authorities early to do research in certain areas suspected of extreme right, the authors are amazed.
More than one stands ready for at least rhetorical or drastic means: "If the case continues to be broken, there will be nothing left for migrants but self-defence and arms."
"it will be the best self-defense."
"Internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," writes "Selen".
What this means is whether domestic peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks by Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s were well explained.
The photo of the ruins after Solingen's fire is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here than there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, what the distrust and the distance from acts of violence could lead to.
However, the attacks have exacerbated our feelings in the Turkish community.
Never repeat past errors
At other times it is mainly the failure of German policy after the attacks that the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln's survivors.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Chief of the Turkish State, he was represented at the funerals in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current report of the Turkish media shows once again how deeply the mistrust of many Germano-turcs has been with the state of local law since that time.
In addition to efforts to further clarify and re-evaluate extreme-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The scandal bank of Lake Zürich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost failed in the financial crisis and has suffered from one crisis to the other.
He's a German who has to run now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, he was known in July that he would occupy an almost as spectacular position in 2013: President of the Board of Directors of the Swiss UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly welcomed, welcomed; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently obtained strength and made a wonderful comment on future colleagues.
"The UBS has succeeded in the Tournaround."
"I am happy to work with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, from September it was clear that everything was going to change.
A retailer of UBS securities in London had turned all of the Bank's security systems away and had flagged about EUR 1.7 billion.
The chief of the board of directors of the Oswald Grübel UBS, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The President of the Board of Directors of the UBS has been considered to be suffering - and everyone asks: When does Axel Weber finally come back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised by the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the administration presidency already in May - not in 2013, as reported by the bank on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economy and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
Once again, he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long deserved the title of "the largest bank in Europe scandal".
Indeed, the UBS is on the one side enormous - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other hand, it has suffered for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, saves her so proud Swiss bank.
This began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also Russian, had combined it with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become a very large bank in the field of banking investment.
So the UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from a simple clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made a impression.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later a bank professor for years in Zurich relates: "I always took the UBS as a good bank model in front of my students."
"In the current perspective, we are asking: how could I have simply fooled myself at this point?"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something was not going round to the UBS.
In the middle of the year President Peter Wuffli retreated surprisingly, which was considered to be a high intellectual and a brilliant banker.
A few months later, he was present for what reasons he had left.
The bank division had flagged with sub-prime documents and had to cross billions.
To achieve this, the UBS announced an increase in capital of 13 billion francs and made a crossover.
For this, it has actually found investors, but who, shortly before, would have cut off the lights: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was put in silence, to the point that one has never even learned its name.
This was only the first time, however.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to announce again the losses of billions, and the president of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, who was still the second Board of Directors in 2006 the best payment in Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS was in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the State in view of its investment errors.
The national bank has bought UBS tens of billions of problematic securities, and the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for convertible bonds to shares, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been drained - because it has noted at what point this can be dramatic for a small country, to cover so large banks.
Finally, the total of the 2007 UBS was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see figure).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," said bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, it was followed by the second.
A few months ago, UBS had been capitulated because of a fiscal dispute with America and had declared itself ready to publish the data from the simplified clientele, who had possibly cheated on the tax with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it has accepted a payment of $780 million - in return for unjustified benefits from these operations with an increased fine.
Thus, UBS published more or less that it had helped tax fraud.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the Head of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the expense of the customers' money.
Thus the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors in a few months: bank investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to tax fraud.
And, as there was a slight return to calm, and as we thought, that the UBS would get out of it, it followed this unfortunate story of title merchants: a single brand of flambe 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was going on.
And it's published: with investment bank risk management, this still doesn't seem to work.
"With the case of Adoboli, it was found that the control of the risks has changed somewhat," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the University of Zurich's Banking Institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also certain of this: "The problem with the UBS is that it does not control the risks in hand."
However, this was precisely the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long served, the need to become a guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too high a risk, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks became the symbol of unbreakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is still pairing with the strong private Swiss bank clique - it's only a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its seat at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from Zurich Central Station, which is surrounded by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, the shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery like Tiffany's, they are found here among Swiss traditional shops as well as those in the Sprüngli conferie.
For centuries, Swiss bankers have lived here: from the national bank through the Swiss Credit Palace to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front of a thick leather chair, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has a day or other market gap - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, the UBS and the Swiss Credit, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business with both major banks.
The UBS would become too large, it is found - especially in the banking investment, where Anglo-Saxons would also spread.
The Swiss would no longer have anything to say.
"And even though they have long adapted to Anglo-Saxons' masters."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon Investment Bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then went down: no European financial institution lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the large Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"On Wednesday, the small country's government coalition to seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in their nation's history," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, political men have agreed to save the big bank from failure.
How could that happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks joined an enormous group.
A bank has been created, which was already too large for small Switzerland - and has continuously recorded an increase.
What has helped is that the two pre-excessive banks of the UBS have completed: a rich but lethargy bank with as a strong point asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but of course already more internationally.
All of a sudden, international investment banks have had favourable access to a lot of money, with which they have been able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the Ascension of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," said bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the most modest intellectual, which is very well understood in models and statistics, and Opel, the intuitive, who broke a path to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Opel would have trusted until the end of Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: the exuberance has arrived before the fall.
UBS staff clearly remember the leaders' meetings during which the leader of the Wuffli group always spoke the same word of order: detract Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
She ordered the "League Tables" rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to climb everything up.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
In the case of currency and securities transactions, it played a very important role.
However, business advisors, who had responsibility for this, have highlighted a weakness: in international business, in the fixed income jargon, there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS has launched itself into an adventure, which has cost him almost his life.
Assuming growth, it is also the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the US sub-prime investments that have invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packed and passed value documents based on U.S. mortgage loans - but which also kept risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to go down.
"It's still in the summer of 2007, while the US real estate market was in flames, UBS bought it there," said Geiger, the bank expert.
The more the euphoria is the bigger the fall is brutal.
One manager after the other had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts, it became more difficult than we thought.
Posts at UBS have become ejectible and are still banks.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
It must find a strategy for a bank for which all the proposed business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: put an end to the investment bank, concentration in property management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn't want to go too far.
But the investment bank has to atrophy vigorously, as far as this is clear so far.
Next Thursday the bank manager Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italians were only supposed to be transitional when the bank separated with surprise from their Gribel predecessor.
In the meantime, it was imposed: it must carry out the affairs of the UBS on a sustainable basis, the Bank of Zurich reported on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress in the mid-1990s.
He cancels 3500 jobs.
But that's not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to earn money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked.
He publicly said so far only that he was going to look for an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US Stock Exchange
The threat of a recession in Europe at the end of the week discouraged US investors.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained unaffected.
The southern industrial production on the continent has shaken the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in its germ.
The general relief on government change in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro has fallen compared to the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass I had only half full last week, not half-empty - but now problems occur once again in the foreground, said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, the financial values were on the sales sheet.
The default values of the Dow-Jones-Index were approximately 0.6% to 12.078 points at the end of the markets.
During the trade, the market barometer fluctuated between 12027 and 12170 points.
The S & P 500 index is more broadly fixed at 1251 points, a deficit of 1%
Nasdaq, the index of the technological stock exchange lost 0.8%, and ended with 2657 market points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax ended with a decrease of 1.2% to 5985 points.
The industry in the 17 euro area countries has significantly reduced its production and adjusted at the end of the recovery.
As announced by the Eurostat Statistics Office, companies produced 2% less than the previous month in September.
US investors said in a skeptical way: "We are not an island, on the other hand," said Steve Goldman of Goldman's management.
Europe will soon not be able to recover from recession, and there are other signs of weakness coming from banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, has only confirmed this caution: "it is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis," he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was too early in its view to invest in obligations arising from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffet has cast an old principle of several decades into the wind and enters the American technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars to IBM has supported the course of the traditional group's actions, and has allowed it to record almost 1% against the trend of commercial management.
The paper has almost been replaced at $187.35.
Buffet claims to have paid an average of $170 per room, and now holds 5.5 per cent.
The price of its investment company Berkshire Hathaway has lost 1.3%.
Bank of America's shares amounted to 2.6%, significantly higher than the market.
The house invested almost all the rest of its shares in the "China Construction Bank" (China Construction Bank) and took away $6.6 billion.
The Institute intends to maintain the company's net profit, including its capital ratio, and therefore meet the most difficult regulatory requirements.
Airplane Boeing has increased its business and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The shares won 1.5% after the company collected the largest order of its history.
Emirates Airlines ordered 50 aircraft of type 777 on Sunday and estimated the value of the order at $18 billion.
Including options for 20 additional machines, the volume goes up to $26 billion.
On the New York Stock Exchange, about 710 million parts have changed hands.
719 values increased, 2281 given and 79 remained unchanged.
On Nasdaq, the business figures ended at 1.38 billion shares with more than 630, a minus 1913 and 82 in exchange.
Smart corneas spread in cities
In many places, frogs are considered "the problem of birds" but experts say that these very intelligent animals are no longer being hunted by cities for a long time.
Some people like them, some others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. The horns have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents multiply because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote to the "opproblem of birds" is not yet in sight.
At the first Ostfriesisch Symposium on the corneas, experts said that it is no longer possible to hunt the frigids of the cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in the cities
The protectionists of nature also relied on the problems of cities on the exodus of specially protected strawberries: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying the traditional living spaces.
The hunting, processing and felling of typical roofing trees made life difficult for birds.
The horns are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 coves in the Westfälisch Soest, in the north-west including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had received negative publicity due to the slaughter of corneas in the region.
Critics found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with particularly brutal gourmets.
"The normal eviction, the evincence, does not serve at all," observed the planner of the city and the landscape of Leer, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of the nests by water under pressure or well downs the trees, often results in undesirable consequences, says environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Bade-Wurtemberg.
"The animals move away, the large colonies split and spread elsewhere."
The event can only be imagined in exceptional cases as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We are forced to live with them, we can no longer eliminate them."
The problem is not solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to Major Wolfgang Kellner of Leer's opinion.
Conceivable is a combination of animal equinoxing with an adverse condition and accommodating offers to allow them to be resettled elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens was looking at "information panels instead of triangles" to establish completely different relationships with those: "We can finally better support a button on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-walking-education of Corbeilles in Schleswig-Holstein, road panels informing about the life of these very smart brakes.
This project has been adopted by tourists in the meantime.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by the birds: "We want a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Frags not only use work tools to achieve a rule but they themselves manufacture their tools as work tools.
Ethologists at Cambridge University recently tested four brakes, to what extent the intelligence of the birds reaches.
In an experience, the birds quickly learned that they had to make a scaffolding with stones to reach a larvae.
Without much training, they firmly recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to break down the platform.
In a second test, the wise horns were then to solve a more tricky problem.
In a cylindrical position vertically, the researchers had placed a small lake with a larvae.
Birds couldn't reach their butt with their beak.
However, the researchers had put iron wire pieces at their disposal.
All four animals formed a crochet with the help of which they fished the small sea of the small tube.
Three of the four brakes were successful even from the start.
Cristiano Ronaldo takes Portugal to the European Championship 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks suddenly remained unsuccessful.
Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the latest tickets at the 2012 European Championship in Poland and suddenly Ukraine was eliminated.
Conducted by the superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53th), Portugal has competed against Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made its fifth participation in the European Championship perfect after the match of 0:0.
The Czechs reached the match to eliminate the return by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first spot (2:0) had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing has been burning any more in the zero 0:0 match between Turkey against Croatia, Ireland has launched 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) marked the other arrows for Portugal.
The former player of the Bundesliga Wolfsburg, Zvězdan Misimovic, with an 11-metre penalty played by hand (41th) and Captain Emir Spahic (65th) made twice a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red map (54e).
Bosnia had already failed at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Éstadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured departure.
Ronaldo sent a 30-metre free shot ahead in the mail.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed her remote shooting qualities and shot at a distance of 25 meters to do 2:0.
The Bosnians, who in the first half of an hour did nothing, had their first clear chance thanks to the attacker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of Manchester City's English championship, launched a headball headed down the transversal bar, and the ball didn't cross the target line (33e).
Jiracek has set a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally, Ergolding's Arbitrary Wolfgang Stark at the center of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during Bosnia's criminality, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card in Portugal (36e).
On the other hand, Stark granted an 11-metre penalty to the disputed hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao which Misimovic certainly differed.
But after the break, the 2004 European Vice-Champion has succeeded four times and everything has become clear.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts during the 81th minute.
Thus, the 1976 European Championship will be the fifth time in the EM.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), also had the chance and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
The Petr Cech goalkeeper prevented a last-minute goal with a reflection by potential Tomas Sivok (9e).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when duo Steven Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic marked the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to the Chech arrow.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the relief of the world-class guard of the Czechs, once again, had been replaced by the FC Seoul attacker (50e).
The purpose shortly before the end has finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed Zagreb's football miracle during this time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his seat on the third EM bank in 2002, Croats were able to enjoy their fourth round at the end of the European Championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir stage, the Turks almost caught up with a dream.
Selcuk Inan scored at the seventh minute with a long shot with only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim couldn't even bury the ball in the goal.
After the time of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic du VfL Wolfsburg, which was replaced by Ivan Perisic de Dortmund in 62 e Minute, legionnaires of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Entrracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken over with a success of 4:0 the first step for a preliminary decision, 32th minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57e) has equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed the higher speed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had received the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment that Estonia's defence was able to prevent a possible target of the first switch.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unproductive defense of the goalkeeper Pavel London, Ward was hand-held and will close the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
The largest software company in Europe, SAP, intends to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, approximately two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and employ employees accordingly," PDG Bill McDermott announced to its clients on an equitable basis in Beijing.
The staff will increase from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader of enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Some 4,000 of the 176,000 global SAP customers are located in this country in full expansion.
The growth plans in China are also an important element of the 2015 Strategy of the Dax Group.
SAP plans to increase the business figures by 2015 to EUR 20 billion.
Last year, Walldorf recorded a revenue of almost EUR 12.5 billion.
Currently, the business management of the software provider, who employs 55,000 people, has never worked well.
SAP has been active in China for more than 20 years.
"Now, we want to extend our activities (...)," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
The reduction of personal mass
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. Titled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and Grief: an intimate story of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters that closes your heart.
A tips to start: carefully remove this page and make it your brand-page.
In this novel of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a tag during these moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the storms of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote here a book that he described, accurately, as "an anti-history book."
It contains some known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is hardly any ambassador or discussion on strategies and materials.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that a "book describing what it might look like" is found there the " feelings, impressions, experiences and humour."
"Beauty and Grief" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, of young schoolchildren and botanists to climbers, passing through doctors, ambulances and sellers.
Some will become heroes.
Others of the prisoners of war, some will lose members, become fools, or lose their lives.
Their lives here vacillate like the churches of a church: while some grow up, there are new ones.
The book of Peter Englund departs from traditional history books.
It is a denunciation of the idea that the First World War is summed up only by the terrible war of strikes on the western front.
"Beauty and Grief" beautifully describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, the Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under the streets; a Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; the teddy flies are an intrusible problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people such as a natural disaster, such as a hurricane Katrina that can heal.
When the cannon blows back away, and you're a mother in the house, do you stay or run?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, not even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been exacerbated by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Grief" follows individuals such as Florence Farmrough, an English food within the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memories, letters and other documents that have already been published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but they are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most approach privacy and the ability to get out of it.
Speaking of the history of a German school, Peter Englund wrote: "Ersatsat, everywhere essat."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on replacement food in Germany.
It describes the "meat made of cooked rice crushed in the fat of sheep (and finished with a false bone of wood); tobacco made with dried roots and dry skin of potatoes; seeds of wood shoes."
He states that "837 authorized meat substitutes are registered in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories deal with honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards the wild and declares about the war: "You feel that after all, it is what men were destined to do, rather than sit in a comfortable faucet, a cigarette and a whisky hand-to-hand, reading a newspaper or a best-selling, and rather than claiming that such a paint is synonymous with civilization, and there is no barbar behind your pressed and closed shirt.
On the contrary, a British soldier realizes that he is at risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to him.
"When one is refused to sacrifice, one hopes to have a public" he wrote.
Unfortunately, it is rather comparable to "a man sentenced to death in secret."
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new forms of terror.
"The conflict is becoming increasingly a history of economic competition," wrote Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He grasps the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the cattle of the beginning of the century: the mass murderer well-connected and ideologically convinced, in well-cut clothes, who executes his butcher while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are both basic behaviors and heroism.
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who have tried to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes at any price in order to avoid the service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the trade of the most due to gonorrhoea, that soldiers buy and "stand on the genital organs in the hope of ending the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into a blindness to life."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's process is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasps the way in which the war has "belonged to uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are at war.
The best works dealing with World War I are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" (The Great War and Modern Memory) by Paul Fussel, or "A West Nothing Again", by Erich Maria Remark, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is a little conventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming I have ever read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like he came up from his book, grabbing this page with your hands where the list of people appears and burned with a lamp.
After a first step, a minutely planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some with anti-fungal helmets.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zucotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few senior officers, as well as others informed from the beginning that they were going to exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges of the Department of Police.
There could be no repetitions of episodes in the last few weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, which went against the department's regulation and caused a storm of public solidarity for demonstrators.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti Park of its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
Police officers were preparing to observe the occupation in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island for the operation of the Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against emulsions - anti-terrorist measures that quickly move a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan area.
The last training session took place on Monday night, on the east-river side of Manhattan.
The orders given to move in the park were reached "at the last minute", said a habit, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
"The few policemen I know who were called didn't know that they would return to Zuccotti Park," said the person under anonymity.
"The only ones to know that they would go there are at the top of the hierarchy of the Department of Police."
The city has learned a lesson, from which the secret of the operation.
On the last 14 October, police officers wanted to clean up the park, but hundreds of demonstrators reported on the plans.
The Tuesday operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the district - dozens of officers who were used to particularly criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were going and coming to the park during the day, like migrants, so one hour in the morning was a good time.
"It should be done when the park had at least one person" he said.
Vehicles of emergency services equipped with spots and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervention.
The recorded lights and messages detracting from speakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
While Community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their clear blue windmill, many demonstrators simply gathered their affairs and left.
No attempt was made before 1:45 p.m., the police said, which left time for the occupants to collect their cases.
Other police teams were reviewed on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the Chief of the Department of Police, said that this measure had been taken only safely.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, strictly detained by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that the television cameras on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police were moving west across the manifests' busy areas, including luggage, plastic gauze and bags full of clothes, the teams of the Department of Sanitation followed, cleaning everything that the occupants left behind.
The few demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of demonstrators took place near the camping kitchen, not far from the park center.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the camp centre have grown together.
Finally, two people flocked to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services were called to cut the chains.
No arrests took place in the park before 3:30 a.m. said Mr. Kelly.
According to the Police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
most for "disobedient to the public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most qualified officer to be found in the places.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not lead the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of policemen were suffering along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
Barricades were placed on Cortlandt Street, a piece of houses north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, south.
The police have seen the extension of the perimeter well beyond the Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of whom were equipped with shields, would have even been seen pushing people away from them.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most lively events of the night took place south of the park.
About 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protestor jumped over the hood of a police car. Others were seen climbing the tires of a police truck.
At some point, a patch of straw came up by flying from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protestant were hospitalized.
The School Aid Union continues the city for Licensing
The union, which represents hundreds of school aids that have lost their employment last month, plans to try a trial in the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools that receive disadvantaged schools.
The prosecutions are probably the last weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, to try to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and sixty-two school aids, parents' coordinators and other employees, who were among the least paid in the city, lost their jobs last October 7th. Trade union leaders compared these allowances to a political revenge so that they did not allow the city to access a health fund managed by the working groups, which would have closed the budget gap in the last spring.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this charge.
At a hearing of the Municipal Council last month, Chancellor Dennis Mr. Walcott said that the redundancies were part of the budget closed in June.
One member of the Council replied, stating that the school grants were not specified in the budget.
The officers of the 37th District Council stated that they would complete a complaint notice, warning the Department of Education that it would continue; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to officially announce the prosecutions to the Supreme Court of State of Manhattan.
Dennis Mr. Walcott and the department of the city's education will be the defensive part. The complainants will be represented by eight licensed workers, all of black or Latin American origins, such as most of the school aids that have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the Legal Department of the City, stated that the municipality had not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore could not comment on the allegations.
According to a statement by the New York Times, the trade union would place on the number of vacancies in schools in the city's most disadvantaged districts to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular under-financing.
While there is no licensing on Staten Island, and a few in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa institutions, 17 school aids have lost their employment in the 23rd Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the South Bronx Districts.
Noting the loss of five school grants on eight employees at Harlem's 36 public school, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecutions say that "This is not a neighborhood of easy parents who can raise funds to fill the budget gap."
The budget of the 36th Public School was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each student registration.
The trade union also claims that the lycée directors could have been misled by certain terms in a memorandum authorising the licensing of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term "transgression" to describe the action, even though "transgression" more generally describes the action to move a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaint, "sixty-six parents coordinators have been licensed", and "not just because of excess".
Mission completed: Congress finds agreement on the issue of Libya
Finally, it would seem that the Republicans and Democrats have found an agreement in the Chapter on the question of the rise in Libya.
The long-term dictator Muammar Kadhafi, as well as the American involvement, will have been a success.
The Senate's Foreign Relations Committee will have to take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democratic - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), praising the Libyan people for their rebellion and the American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is about honoring the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It is a bipartisan support to their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators from both sides came into conflict, along with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve the military role of the United States in NATO's mission to Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to authorize the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day as the draft bill failed, the House of Deputies also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the financing of US operations in Libya.
The US mission was therefore left in a form of legislative purgatory - the Congress was sufficiently opposed to criticise the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut the grass under its feet.
Congress's indecisiveness was exceeded by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Kadhafi was killed last October.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "happily congratulates the Libyan people for their courage and extraordinary determination for their freedom" and "happily welcomes the men and women of the American armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also states "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure be fully supported by the Senate's Foreign Affairs Commission or will it divide the legislators as in June?
The Senator and Chairman of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said on Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Capitol, the House must vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Republicans of Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republikain Bob Goodlate (Virginie), will constitute the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other matter, to obtain a flooring vote in the House or in the Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to approve their amendments, but this is not without attempt.
The Goodlate amendment is part of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been tabled at Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are repetitive - the same bill proposed at both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations of a previous one.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handbook that "would control federal expenditures."
Some of these bills are identical, but they give their support - especially the new Republicans who wish to lose their CV - the chance to boast of being "the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act approved last August called for the vote of the House and the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates that Congress members can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to extend the limits of two mandates for the presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a number of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is permanently proposed, as is the amendment banning the profanation of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the annulment of federal laws if the two thirds of the States are opposed to them.
It is also true that the members of the House have been willing to offer amendments, they are not as fast as they were in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments and introduced 66 at 110th.
The slowdown compared to the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed at Congress in 1789.
"Massacree but not beat" said Gabrielle Giffords during his first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man shot him at the end of Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on Monday night in a television show, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said he wanted to get back rather than go back to Congress.
On his appearance in the television "20/20" on the ABC channel, next to Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The show approached her hard return after the ball that fractured her skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing her head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
During his first television interview since the shooting in January, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and qualified his recovery as "hard".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years old, replied "very well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and his husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special edition of an hour of "20/20", broadcast the watch of the release of the new book of the couple entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special issue has retraced the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords since the shooting on January 8th.
In the videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, his shaver head and a broad scar on the front.
She can only use one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords was sitting in a wheelchair while doctors taught him to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word, "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords heard another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of her breakfast.
The videos released by ABC show the important role of music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: are we seeing the representative singing with doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours with doctors every day, said not to remember the shooting.
According to her husband, she was reading an article on the shooting of March 12 when she stopped and asked for information about the six people killed during the incident for the first time.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison in Missouri and was actively treated pending the trial.
"There's been a lot of deaths," said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
At her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten."
"Then I'd say, " Gabby, you weren't beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You just got massacred.
And you're going to get out, get back and get back even stronger than ever.
More mercy than respect for the troops
The event: a gala at Wall Street to collect millions of dollars for vets without New York City's home.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotentness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in tie-up has stood up to its feet to hail it.
"The military, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of spring fundraising.
A military high-level in the gala, also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Head of Staff of the United States Army, saw the role of troops differently.
"They were presented as an orphelin kind," wrote the military senior in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But that was not respect, just mercy.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praises are given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, they say some soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if it was sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not all victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to get us involved in the role of evil spirits."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not want to appear unrecognizable or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the coming troops of the Vietnam war was much worse.
Thus, most of the conversations on mercy take place in all confidence among the veterans.
After his two sons returned from the battle with the Marines, the retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and traveled to distant contrasts.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the government in Washington.
When searching for a job, he said that he felt that some people who had brought him the interview asked in a subtle way if he could hold the stress of a job demanding Washington immediately after his return to the fight.
"When you approach the subject of the service, you are confronted with negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from the American indifference to war.
The victories are rarely welcomed by a country that is as familiar with the army as it is with the military and which has little direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for World War II," says Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of political men and people are largely focused on the depth of a soldier's suffering.
The troops are recognized for the number of extended service periods, the number of lost friends or the extent of the injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to fight the rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged rape inaction.
Where appropriate, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next.
The 1st-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and was pregnant for 11 weeks the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She returned to her home at Miramar Air Station, in the north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a package of beer.
He asked if he could join her in his room to drink a glass.
"C" was an alarm signal," says Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texane's been sidetracked.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas" she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her in the back, thrown her down and raped, claiming.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still in service and others, will look forward to the decision of justice during a historic trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and which will decide whether a trial against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld will take place.
The latter are accused of not stopping the generalization of rape within the army, thus opposing the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial involved 17 complainants. This number rose to 28 the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide appropriate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says to take it to the galloned soldiers, because the problem starts with them.
"The Army is a vertical structure" she says.
"Where are the individuals in position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? The leaders."
The lawyer also states that since February, she has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom may be part of future judicial proceedings.
Its strategy: instead of gathering all complainants in this case - thus putting all their eggs in the same basket - it will try several trials, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The Defence Team, for the Department of Defence, led by U.S. attorney Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
The judicial documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused by the armed forces.
According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, named Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by active staff.
" The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants " indicate the documents.
The Department of Defence refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to war, this distinction is recorded only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women's troops play an increasingly important role, including in contact with local women.
As a result, in both wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two thirds in a combat situation.
It's time for the army to modernise itself says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three other trials are ongoing in addition to hers.
At Yale's Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Centre prepares a case against the four main military academies in order to promote a mesogynous environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America prepares a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnostics of " personality disorders " attributed to victims of rape to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as the Women's Action Network Service Year, a group for human rights.
His group sought a trial in December with the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in order to deal with claims of benefits for those claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent Bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mixture of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Department of Defense's Department of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. In fact, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred this year.
The report issued in March also examines the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the army were brought to trial - half of the percentage of the civil judicial system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she reported to the Military Police less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail her rape to various policemen, doctors and commanders.
She went up a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her attacker - due to a cut to her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman was sitting before a judge, in a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relationship with her little friend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six persons testified as moral witnesses to the author of the crime, who ended up being executed.
"I remember the day the verdict was made," Elizabeth Lyman said.
"I thought I was going to start having contracts, and I started screaming after the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember telling my commander, "It wasn't his trial, it was mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who ended up diagnosed with a personality disorder, making her useless to the service.
In January 2010, it was referred under less than honorable terms, preventing it from receiving any benefit.
Whether Lyman and other complainants will move forward or not, it is a long story, says John Turley, a professor of law at the Faculty of Law at the University of Washington.
However, he noted, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine that has been criticised since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized Doc Feres.
The army is located decades ago because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrence imposed by responsibility.
"The chances are hard on them... but it's important that they try," he added.
These things only change when the good are willing to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the complainant's lawyer, will gather his hundreds of other complainants for other trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is no reform," she said.
Where until we died, one or the other of the two options.
The walls have eyes: the researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy who was part of his online anti-immigration opinions.
On Monday, Breivik, who recognized that he had been taken out of a blood vessel in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time preceding the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme-right groups on social networks sites.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy... connect to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report published by DEMOS's thinking group on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook boasts so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the website advertising tool to find the people they are looking for with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team found that half a million members are fans of extreme right-wing groups in Europe. It targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to an investigation. The questions raised were their level of education, their attitudes towards violence and their optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people via Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 participants from 14 extreme-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It's a new way to do research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not quite surprising: online participants in right-wing groups are, rather, men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
The DEMOS study is just an example of how Facebook became the new unmistakable tool between scientists' hands.
Groups of reflections, medical researchers and polytologists use the site to study all topics that touch on health issues such as social trends, thanks to "I love", publications on walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, the "supernova data" generated an explosion in research, increasing the number of research work the site name appears in almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people you could not approach in the street.
"Before, when you were trying to investigate people of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go to the party, but they'd never let you in," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all of this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their state-of-the-art activities had far more chances of being alcoholics than discreet students in this regard.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to possibly help a student whose status would be too frequent to talk about alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development of Children at the Research Institute for Children in Seattle, says Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not be otherwise recognized."
Facebook also constantly accesss information from its users.
The team of the site that deals with data has studied statistics on the loving situation and the day of Saint Valentine, the rate of participation in the mid-term elections of 2010 and a national happiness index (only with information available - the digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its data storage available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site observes them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometers away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation that they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have well defined instructions on how to collect information other than via the Internet, there is something else online.
"I don't think a lot of users have already thought that a researcher could study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As they know, the exchanges were seen only by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is entirely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the true degree of a profile or on the wall of a user.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things," says Neil Selwyn.
That is why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a block-note and a style remain the best tools we can use.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he said.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and the social aspect, it is not before a computer."
"Froid and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik's first appearance
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organised the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first appearance to the trial that took place in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Temples," he explained in front of a hearing room filled with 500 people.
"As for the jurisdiction of the court, I reject it, because you hold your mandate of organizations supporting a hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I don't complain guilty."
Judge Torkiel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to allow him the opportunity to use this trial to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to leave Breivik, who brought with him a speech on paper, to speak to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the Police to keep Breivik in custody for twelve more weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks, and warned him that the authorities would monitor almost all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Thirty surviving parents and victims were present at the hearing.
Some have come in the hope of looking Breivik in the eyes, others to make sure it would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman" said a survivor of Utoya at the Norwegian TV channel NRK.
"I wasn't at ease, but I personally made some progress after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes as they entered and out of court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The 22 July attacks therefore seem to be the work of an extremist rather than of an entire group of radicals, which may be comforting to some.
But this does not reduce the sorrow or confusion felt by the nation as a whole.
"I'd prefer it to look like a monster, but that's not the case," said a victim's parent.
"That would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the cinema this week
After Steve Jobs died last October, some compared it to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical engineering and inventor of modern computer technology.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a recently found Steve Jobs interview that will be released this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is how much this creative spirit had understood the processes and workflows of products.
He was certainly a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself as a hippie, but was also very methic and organized, as well as an improvement in organizational charts - a man who believed that many business leaders would suffer from a "maladie that they thought a brilliant idea made 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a brilliant idea from a product of exception."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series retraces the computer's birth, and he sat for over an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, aiming at popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of the maintenance with Kringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It's only after Steve Jobs' death that a complete video is found in the director's garage.
This slightly uplifted video is the base of a 68-minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released to the film on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems here to be surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing technological philosophies and his commercial strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly ponders his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also times when the perfectionism of Steve Jobs comes up, where he seems to be reluctant to hear the questions of Crinely, giving him moments of care to speed him up and move him to more important issues or subjects.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there is a strangely prominent aspect of Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers to be good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computer science.
It's something to read posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something dirty and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dream at the age of size.
It has a vision of how things can and must be.
He then explains the implementation of them immediately.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"For all these years, I have always asked, 'Why do you do things?" and the answers are always the same: 'oh, just because you have to do them.'"
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues by giving details of his efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Perplexes about how the costs were recorded - often started with a "standard cost" assessed for nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - it developed an automated plant that guaranteed the precise calculation of the commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs reports the anecdotes of the "Bleue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that used to hack phone networks and phone for free in a long distance.
The device has made many writings in advance, but Steve Jobs' e-mail here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of ownership is contagious.
He describes the way he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, then calling and connecting from one AT&T network to another while turning as many satellites as possible.
"We would wrap up the ball of various things a half a dozen times and you would scream in the public phone and it would come to you a minute later on the public phone next door," explains Jobs laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We don't know a big thing both of us, but we've come up with a small thing that can control big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have developed: he telephoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asked Henry Kissinger to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go mad laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love with technology (and departure from Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, at the track at the remote parts to manufacture a frequency, he is looking for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and passes a thread.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"This has had a remarkable influence on me. C" was the only company I saw at that age and it formed my definition of a company and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs was subsequently one of HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first office computer ever designed."
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a small cathode tube, and I fell in love with him.
The teenager who was in the state returned to HP and began to write programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products at a head start.
At the beginning of his career, while he is installed to sell some printed circuit cards, a client asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only 30 days of credit, he had to take care of the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later, in Apple, he remembers the difficulties he faced to develop a computer mouse:
"I remember great arguments... I was raised on top of it, claiming that it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Forty-nine days later, we had a smile that we could make for $15, which would be incredibly reliable.
In the case of the large companies that are operating:
Even before he brought Apple back to life, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way many industrial leaders were going to cheat and lose control of their market share.
"Let's admit that you're working at IBM or Xerox, you're doing a better copy or a better printer, and then?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these are the types of persons] who end up leading companies and the specialized personnel in production are excluded from decision-making.
The product engineering that has led to this monopoly position is completely conjured by people who can't imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have held the entire computer industry.
It could have done ten times its current size. Xerox would have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
They've drawn the defeat to victory.
About innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge part of manual work separates a brilliant idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises to do... certain things you can't do, the electrons can, the glass, the robots, the factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by bringing them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. This is to try to expose you to the best products that men have created, and to try to bring these things to the product that you create.
Picasso once said good artists copy and great artists fly.
We're always ashamed to steal great ideas.
This is what makes Macintosh exceptional in part. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply had the best computer scientists in the world.
If it was not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with opponents of health law while the court meets
The day the Supreme Court met at home to discuss the issue of political disagreement, namely whether the opposition to President Obama's health law will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were observed during a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case before the high court.
The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases in question was an attempt by 26 States to challenge the reform of the comprehensive health care voted by Congress last year, a law that was a focal point for conservative militants at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a 5h30 monumental argument is expected next March, and the result will probably be a way to encourage the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court's decision is delivered.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue on the rejection of the law will probably be Paul Clement, who served as a general solicitor of the United States during George W. Bush's administration.
The legal firm of Clement, PLLC Bancroft, was part of the two dozen cabinets that helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to defending the conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, who presented a huge financial issue in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
There was, among other things, Mitch McConnell, a republican top of the Senate and a declared opponent of the health law.
The guests see dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing going against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from a code of conduct governing the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would undoubtedly argue by the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may attend a collection of funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge may not be an interpreter, an honorary guest, or a member of the program of such an event."
However, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, is sufficient to alert activists of government ethics.
"This violation of ethics and great indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court complies with the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and ate and collected gala funds with lawyers who have court cases before the court."
Their presence and participation in the collection of funds of this event demonstrates any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little respect for critics claiming that they are too easy to mix court cases with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high profile conservative.
In addition, conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a problem of ethics, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general candidate for Obama's administration when the first opposition to the law was brought to the Court of First Instance.
His critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she was too invested in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan didn't give any indication that she would.
Boeing records a record order of $18 billion for online aircraft
The Emirates air company orders 50 Boeing 777, bi-collour lines, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at over a billion dollars.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order containing 50 of its products.
On the other hand, this is a case where the company in question is the aircraft manufacturer of Boeing and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record of $18 billion.
It is also amazing who Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a gold mine increasing from future aircraft orders.
In the forecast published on Monday, Chicago's airline believes that the air carriers in the Middle East will need $2,520 aircraft of a total value of $450 billion in the next 20 years.
During the weekend, Boeing reported on the most expensive commercial aircraft order in his history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-coloirs.
It is the Emirates-based airline in Dubai that passed this Pharaohic command.
Boeing announced in the 2011 Dubai Aeronautics Room that the airline is also able to buy 20 additional planes, which would raise the total amount of the order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated on Monday that the company Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, named Dreamliners, a model that boasts important fuel savings and conveniences for passengers.
The amount of these six devices amounts to over a billion dollars.
"It's clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have great value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries have many of their airlines.
They therefore have not only the means to pay these planes, but a rise in the fuel price - which is harmful to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them as the country would earn money with the rise in the oil price.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the oil price increases, Dihora reported.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
The order of Emirates reinforces Boeing's predominance on the market of large-scale carriers and helps to slow down the aggravation of the Airbus competitor with its A350.
Boeing's victory in the airship is four months after the announcement of Airbus to report the beginnings of the largest version of the A350, which rivals directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus rejects its initials to increase its push after asking its customers to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing's shares increased by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister manifestly beaten at the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers helped her opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the run to the governor's position.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to gain access to the office of Governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers promoted one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was in charge of the race at the position of Governor of that Western State.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon told the radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election agents... they took out urns, installed roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI has ruled Mexico for sixty-ten years until the loss of the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have been seen only recently by Calderon, who was in charge of the polls before the day of the elections.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative party of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a left candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, which currently holds the role of Governor, has become a third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidentials for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, denouncing all links with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine trafficking.
This is the state of origin of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet, violence has persisted.
A week before the elections, a PAN mayor was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates refused the campaign locally for fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections have air, a victory will help the party in its wake.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to come to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank asked India and China to prepare to help the euro area emerge from the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Director General of BASD, based in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing economic forces in the world had to "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indifferent eye" and noted that Asian financial support from Europe's leaders and resources would help to avoid a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We are all in this crisis."
"Therefore, anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected up to a certain point, but it's not in the open."
"Then if China and India can help, nothing will prevent them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan is dangerously high and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has made the world's economy unresolved, and has led to the call for major emerging economies to meet to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that the IMF would provide any Asian assistance, but he also stated that this bilateral assistance - as the United States' financial salvation fund is to be purchased, the European Financial Stability Fund - would offer greater negotiating power to the Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Commerce and Industry of India, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy now suffers from a decrease in exports and delays in the arrival of foreign capital.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to meet and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a choice, it's an imperative, because where will we find work for tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich Europeans while facing their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically difficult to accept European aid to 1.2 billion people, at least 800 000 of whom live with $2 a day, or less.
"One day, they will discover that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and that they leave on vacation in the sun and they will have trouble getting it," he said.
Lee Howell, president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep many Greek officials well paid in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the rail sector.
Mr Nag said that the euro area crisis could cause "significant impacts" across Asia.
The BASD forecasts of a 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 are now facing "risks of loss" due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed "to develop relief plans" to protect themselves from economic and significant capital leakage.
Several Pentagon warnings on potential defence reductions
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, put pressure on the Congress on Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budgetary compressions would know national security, and triggered a financial response from the Pentagon's corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields, passing through the civil collections.
The Pentagon already owes $450 billion for the next decade, but now fears that an additional amount of $600 or more compression will be imminent if Congress does not reach an agreement on expenditures.
"The impact of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is called the sequestration would result in 23% reductions as well as the freeze of many new projects.
"A reduction so important, so applied without discernment, would make most of our ships and our construction projects impossible - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and bring serious damage to other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians free of charge to achieve the goal."
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our soldiers and seriously harm our preparation."
Reductions would possibly affect fighting troops, continue Panetta.
"Although wartime financing of foreign contingent accounts is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by the serious disturbances in the core budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contracting personnel would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and the supervision of contracts supporting the war."
"The staff managing salaries would be reduced, resulting in late payment to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, requesting details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a sequestration on the Department of Defence would have triggered a rapid decline in the United States as the world's undisputed leader of military power."
"We are extremely opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint communiqué Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
"This is not a consequence that we can live with, and that is certainly not what we should impose on us."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not happen."
Whether Panetta's letter and the senator's recent warnings increase the pressure for a budgetary compromise or an appeal to exempt the Pentagon from reductions, it remains to be seen.
Panetta was increasingly virulent about the possible compressions, even though he himself had reached the highest position of the Pentagon with years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knew that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence painted a dark picture of what could happen - a soldier with a shell, but not a kernel.
"It's a marineless ship."
"It's a ballless brigade."
"It's a hunting plane, not enough trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of casseroles, buildings and bombs that do not have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in her preliminary remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed, ill-prepared and unable to face potential opponents."
"In fact, she invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could "supply significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage us in the world; and risk assumed unacceptable in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could be cut off, including those already tested and some just at the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new scheduled bomber, the ballistic submarine of a new generation, the new coastal combat ship and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Marine Humvee.
To put an end to F35's development and testing could generate $80 billion over 10 years, but its supporters say that this is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivers.
How to Record a Lie
A look at recent manchettes indicates the extent to which deception and lying are omnipresent in everyday life.
The Republican candidate for President Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accused of lying.
Penn State's administrators were accused of compensating for allegedly covering reports that a football coach had sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open microphone claiming to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and robbed countries.
The member of the Congress of New York and the celebrity of the Internet Anthony Weiner, was passed on to an idiot by quickly issuing denunciations contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
The former candidate for President John Edwards was charged with violations of the funding of campaigns related to the coverage of an extra-conjugal link.
And then none of those who have lived the story will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying during his second term of office on his sexual involvement with Monica Levinsky.
The school and university test fraud accounts are legional.
There have been cases where teachers gave the student test answers in order to take a close look at their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the contrary send the message that lie and deceit are acceptable.
How many frauds do we meet?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
To detect or identify lies is an essential competence that everyone must acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to write: "I've had you", the detection of fraud is a serious knowledge-based branch of scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted a thorough research on such projects, including psychology and physiology.
One of the research results is that the oldest myths on the lie have been demystified.
The liars look in your eyes.
They don't blush, they don't blush or they don't get upset.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.
A qualified fraud detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, the training of the question and the time of response.
I spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging knowledge about fraud, and it is clear that the detection of fraud is a modern competence that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include employment, interviews, negotiations or management.
Good liars are able to read to others, by putting them at ease, by managing their own emotions and by intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that aliens lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "focused on them" while women say more "focused on others" lies - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if someone's lying?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call "the setting of benchmarks."
This helps to provide a reference point to measure subsequent changes.
Watch the post of your topic, laugh, voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally removes his feet permanently in order not to start unfair accusations when you see him remove his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues of misleading and non-verbal behavior.
Consider these indications as red flags, not evidence of fraud.
Traitors can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, turn around to a exit, change posture significantly, or present a relief of "post-interview" - an excessive sigh of relief, a change of posture when all difficult questions have passed.
Questionnaires often indicate that maintenance is completed just to try to trigger the post-interview response.
So pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson rushed through using the past, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
The deceptive individuals can also use a remote language: "I have not had sexual relations with this woman... Ms. Levinsky" or repeat a completely difficult question.
The most common speech indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood language" when answering a difficult question, "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember things... to my knowledge."
This makes the conceptual answer rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize fraud is possible.
These skills will improve anyone's chances of avoiding victimization by sinks in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be routed after the US late approval threat
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of a oleodic project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - causing the wrath of trade unions while calming environmentalists - the company seeking to build the oleodic said that it is ready to redirect the project to return it to rails.
TransCanada stated on Monday night that it will move the projected pipeline outside the environmentally sensitive zone of the dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still gain its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the capital of Nebraska.
TransCanada's official, Alex Purbax, says that the company remains confident that it will end up obtaining the approval of an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
As a result, the Department of State announced last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it received new studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of the Nebraska dunes and the Ogallala aquifer, from vast sources of groundwater.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska in Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Department of State would probably have remedied any decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although officials deny the involvement of the policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and expressed his support.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He would transport 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta Province to the Texas refineries.
To do so, he would have to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who put on the 20 000 estimated jobs related to the pipeline.
But the legislators of Nebraska opposed to this plan pressure that a law to force the removal of the Sand Hills region and Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study of the Department of State found that the project would have only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Department's Chief Inspector ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist engaged by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice for its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle pursues for allegedly causing a young child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle, launched in a detachment of violence in the hall of their Manhattan building, terrorized their little girl to the point where she was afraid of it.
The withdrawal of the singer "Lady Marmalade" broke out the 18-month-old little Geneva Monk, so that she suffered "change of personality, sleep disorder" and "the increased fear of foreigners", said her family during the trial of the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was November 10 of last year when the technician Kevin Monk, his teacher's wife of the children's garden, Rosana, and Geneviève were preparing to leave on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was looking for the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the hall of their apartment of Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Geneva in his arms.
Rosaanna Monk said she had stopped at the door and had placed her daughter for a moment.
"Someone came after me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes" and I went looking for her," she said.
LaBelle was angry with the pregnant woman.
"She said to me of an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," said Rosaanna Monk.
"I told him, "what you say or think I don't care."
She became angry and began to use oaths - the word "" and the word "" of a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water, and she started scaring me from the water of the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneva became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you have done to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself on her mother - who was always holding Geneva in her arms - and had to be held by her surroundment that led her to a car that was waiting for them, says Rosaanna Monk.
The little girl would cry so hard that she got to vomit, add her.
Later, the family sent a note requesting LaBelle's apology, but received no reply.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBelle did not return our calls for comments.
The complaint claims unspecified damage, but the family lawyer Sam Davis said that he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to make a donation of all the money received to a charity against cancer for children.
"The aim is to keep Patti LaBelle responsible for her conduct," said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a mother-teacher with an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, unemployment and informality increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment decreased and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-calling of the change, which has generated great expectations regarding economic progress, but given the climate adverseness of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
Low temperatures in February, in addition to the loss of billions for the agricultural sector, limited the opportunities of the State economy for growth, led to a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the low historical rate of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of frozen allocations from the Mexican Rural Development Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remainder of 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main crops suffered were vegetables, corn and pears.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of unemployment of the State during the first three quarters of the year was seen as an accelerated increase, since, from January to March 55, 053 people were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter, the rate was 5.28 per cent, and from July to September the average continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, a rate of more than 74 thousand unemployed people, an increase compared to the first half of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the U.S.A., the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
"What is observed is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources by approved legislation in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work for them, invest them and use them in something," he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes reported that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the State to go to work abroad has been limited to the United States first because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because they already have a lot of difficulties in finding work, these people stay here and ask for work sources, which leads to increased unemployment," he said.
Not serious
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloen is exacerbated by considering the high level of serious shortage which predominates between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in the labour market does not work as a worker in any social insurance institution.
Apart from the unemployment and the serious lack of unemployment, another reason for the state's redundancy is low wages, the entity has lower salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Labour Secretariat and Social Forecast.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which is 7 thousand 375 pesos.
IED contraction
Apart from the drop in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, in 2011, the highest reduction in foreign direct investment over the past 10 years was recorded, according to the State's Economic Secretariat from January to June, the State FDI reached $630 billion 697, representing a 87.74 per cent decrease compared to the $5,143 thousand 312 recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion per year, primarily recorded by companies in the third sector.
Leave this
In view of the economic contract scenario, the Government of the State requested in July the approval of a three-billion-weight credit for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of revitalizing the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600-billion-weighted and no profit was observed in any sector of the State economy until November.
Reactions
For representatives of the employers sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of Sinaloa's economy during this year was really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have to align the effort of all, and above all the already well-synchronised walk of this new government team, hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Economic interest rate
Loredo López said that events such as the early freezes of the year have kept the economy of the state and have limited its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced by several events, including ice, one of the main effects was a slow economy which is not moving fast enough to generate an economic dynamic that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services, and therefore, at the end of the year, we close much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefine the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, stated that the state is being channelled towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general we have noted that we have worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the State, because it is important to detach all the potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources," he said.
A lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in various areas, but there is some progress in economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware that there is still much to be done," he said.
Condemned for 8 kilos of marijuana
A person resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of fines for holding eight pounds of marijuana.
The Public Prosecutor General of the Republic informed that Omar Alexis Valenzuele Sandoval, for a crime against health, was convicted of possession of marijuana for sale.
In accordance with AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuel Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of the number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker passed in a pick-up truck, white, in which he carried a bag of black color in the vehicle's luggage and on the co-pilot's seat a small back bag where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements were made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Legal Consequences Implementation Centre.
This appropriation is intended to cover expenditure relating to the provision of information and information to the general public and to the public in the field of information and communication technology.
Social activities in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Espacios Públicos and 3x1 for migrants may not be over where to record serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda reported.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that even though the construction programmes have so far progressed, they are in a risk situation, as the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions that exceed 11 million pounds in the three programmes.
He noted that the total investment of these three programmes was approximately 50 million weights, of which the State had to provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for the works, so there was the possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They must make a contribution of 12 million, and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have not given us anything, even if since July they had to give us a share," he said, "and we, in order not to register late, started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the government had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already experienced this in the previous sex period because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to operate and this year, in order to have access to these programs, we had to obtain the resources to cover what the State had not paid," he said.
Despite the fact that there was a commitment by the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate management so that the corresponding percentages would reach as quickly as possible.
"They must provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have not given us anything."
The valid court "the analogic cut" in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of analogue signals by digitals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) began the constitutional disputes that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies had made against the presidential decree that preceded the so-called "analogous coupe" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes necessary for the invalidity had not been met.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his mandate when he issued a decree detailing the actions to be taken to bring about the transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was set aside for failure to reach the qualified majority of eight votes in order for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft decision, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because the regulation on radio and television is a statutory assignment to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree and, by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions envisaged by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of the Ministers also decided to initiate the complaint made by the House of Deputies, without discussing the project to which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures for the public administration to prepare for the project.
"I no longer consider that it would affect the autonomy of the governing body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, who has the government for constitutional mandate.
The substitution of analogue signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years and this has resulted in better operation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more chains.
Adding the change, he said, would add the benefits of digitization that involve a decision of public interest which does not only have a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "needs the operation of a system established, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, to include a group of allocations that the Constitution grants to the power of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has somehow invaded the sphere of competence of Congress, as it ensures in the administrative sphere that the laws issued by the Legislative are respected.
An analysis of the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data provided by PREP, the difference between the first and second seats of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to 879 out of the 6 thousand 74 total verbatim records.
The "vote by vote" bill is a reality for the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data provided by the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (PREP) the difference between the first and second seats of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to the 879 out of the 6 thousand 74 total verbatim records.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IMM), María de los Llandales Zaragoza, recalled that a number of days ago, last November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonise local standards for federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán has not approved either its Political Constitution or its Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act, at the same time that the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period so that this electoral process can enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Range has omitted its publication within the time limits provided by the Official Journal of the State Act, with the argument that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the Local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the State Ombudsman for constitutional reforms, because he did not have the right to "sanction or challenge them".
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llandal said that through the approval of the relevant guidelines by the IEM General Council it will be possible to complete the partial and total vote by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of vote and the minutes are not counted in the minutes file at the chairman's office; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of votes received in all polling sessions may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winning the respective election and the person who received the second place in the poll is equal or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the party representative and/or coalition who presented the second of the candidates reported.
The total voter count may also be made if at the end of the joint count it is that the difference between the alleged winning candidate and the second-ranking candidate is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is an express petition from the political party to whom the second candidate has been issued, in which case the electoral packages that have been the subject of the partial count will be excluded.
It should be noted that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PRSP, the difference between the first and second seats is only 0.16 per cent, even without accounting for the votes of 129 of the 923 total verbatim records.
His Last Will
Its ashes will be spread in Zapalinamé's Sierra, confirming the family.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive at Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday to the night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a mass of rest.
According to his family, the last intention of the Lieutenant-Colonel was to spread his ashes in the Zapalinamé Sierra.
After receiving the honors of the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft from the Mexican Air Force, the closest attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
In the middle of the morning, the ashes of the Lieutenant-Colonel arrived at the watch-keeping chapel of the Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where the family and friends went.
At 17:30 a.m., he was honoured at the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former technological baccalaureate colleagues and the American football team, which was part of Felipe Bacio when he was preparing for the baccalaureate.
"He would like to return to Saltillo and his ashes to be scattered in Zapalinamé's Sierra, he always said that to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
To her, the lieutenant-colonel had realized all his dreams, she considered him to be in the fullness of his life, "he had success, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and cared for his family a lot."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, because they said he had a bad truck, but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as was the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopan for the graduation of his parents, so he knows that his uncle is dead by doing what he loved most in life: piloting an aircraft.
Last Bye
In honour of his visit to Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force Felipe Bacio Cortés, he was honoured by Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and was distinguished in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, alongside the secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and six others, all officials of the service.
The rest of the Bacio Cortés pilot born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 to be handed over by the funeral to the members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the group's schedule, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and other parents, students and teachers.
Three abandoned bodies, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before being found, the military authority had presented to the media 11 persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for organized crimes.
Three men were found killed by fire shot in different parts of the body and with the strike grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km from Cadereyta road in Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
A few people who went through this place noticed that in the property, whose closing has the beige color and coffee the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, at approximately three metres, they located the corpses of three persons, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; on his side there was another one with a white T-shirt, with shoes.
At a distance there was another person's body with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
The three were stretched on the belly.
According to the on-site data, the three people had been murdered in another location, as there were no duplicates on-site.
At the close of the property there were legends addressed by a group of organized crime to the other, except for a few dance orifices in it and in the portal.
11 caught in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that would operate mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are considered to be related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (monitorance) and clandestine inhumations.
According to the information published, eight persons were arrested in the Los Alveros colony on 11 November and one who had been deprived of liberty was saved.
Three buildings and a cell phone were confiscated; they claimed to be part of the criminal group called "The Zetas".
In another event that took place on November 12 at 06:00, military personnel took a surveillance course in Rancho Viejo, Cadeeryta, detecting a car without a registration plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, and after these statements, on November 13 to 14:00, one of his accomplices was arrested in La Fuda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are attributed to clandestine inhumation in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The Prime Minister appointed, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on board the economic disaster and put the whole Eurozone at risk.
A communiqué from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that it will present a cabinet composed in its majority by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive will take up his position.
Monti said he was going to present to the president the outcome of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "frame is now well drawn", he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, while Italy was fighting a political and financial crisis that led to the cost of its debt at levels that could not be supported.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a hard austerity package required by European leaders to regain confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Stressing the pressure on Monti to move, the instability of the markets to place the performance of the Italian BTP obligations 10 years above 7 per cent, the level to which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian patronal confindustria, told the media after his meeting with Monti: "We said that we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Monti's chances of success were greatly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which forced the crisis to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, the secretary of the centre-right party, told the press.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the Government of a technocrat majority formed by Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new government of Monti must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that Monti's failure would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations with political, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations on Monday.
He'll finish his round of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed by Napolitano on Sunday, which enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief review at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of Italian debt have now come back to critical levels between uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.9 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences in the Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should continue until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite generalized predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections proceed.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insisted that he should be trained only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual suspicions and disagreements between the parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish experience is superior to that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 gathered attended 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to Costa Rica's, if we compare the 22 called by the two countries for today's amicule, at 15:05 a.m., at San José National Stadium.
While national and European champions, the number one of the FIFA's monthly rankings, account for a wide record of class A inter-selective games, Tricolore has only the defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in the powerful clubs of the First League of England maintain an intense activity this year in national league championships and coups and in European matches such as the Champions League.
To this end, the experience with Furia Espanola must be added during the complicated eliminations of the European Cup and the World Football World.
Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have a limited international experience in an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered to be a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish Selection is that of the target guard Iker Casillas, who last Saturday against England (defence 0-1 in London) compared the record of the former target guard Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and they will impose a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's brain flyer, at 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized last week by UEFA next to the other hundreds of Iberian teams, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the front centre of Schalke Raúl González, with 102.
Near the centenary number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He was followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Inista, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and close to Michael Umana are the left side of Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the Bryan Ruiz switch, with 45.
After that, only five games exceeded: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
At least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appeared with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not start yet.
The historic butcher of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour to celebrate two decades of trekking
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the group is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group ensures that for them this dream will also become a reality to happen in that country.
It is that the bassist and founder member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two-departure celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only stage in Central America.
This day will be presented at the National Stadium, from 19:30 a.m., next to the Los Angeles The X Group and the Las Robertas Nationals.
This is an extract from the conversation, whose full transcription is on the Internet in La Nación.
For his Costa Rican fans, the fact that Pearl Jam is going to take place in Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality. Do you realize what your fans are living in?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and has so far been great.
I spent only once vacation in Costa Rica; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
We are therefore thrilled to have our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, the fans live with intensity the previous days.
What is your message for your hottest fans?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took us 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so much and we are sorry that so much time had to pass to this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the larger shows we have offered over the past 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We offered two giant shows in Sao Paolo and we hope this has shaped us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really eager to produce it.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you find Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of surfers and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; this is how we learned it, through people who love surfing.
When you saw the tour, you offered huge shows, with a lot of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never been produced there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best possible show, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse directory.
You never repeat the directory.
What's this all about?
I think it's partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and each loves different songs, that's why it's very hard to choose which songs to interpret every evening.
When we have two or three songs in the directory that we have not interpreted for a long time, it helps us to stay focused and surprise us because it reminds us of the reasons why we love these songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting to us and so I think it becomes more interesting to people.
With this tour, you will celebrate 20 years of travel.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've succeeded?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I believe that none of us had imagined that we were going to form a great rock group, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years made it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together makes us very excited.
We love and love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't go any better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
This has always been an honor for us to be part of this group of large groups.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising when a movement emerges from a group of friends and is less common.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honor to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in their tour, so we're lucky to be still friends with them all, and it's an honor to be part of this sound of Seattle that has emerged.
It's as strange as a group like yours being united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and this is only much more time than many groups normally take.
First of all, I believe that we are all able to be still alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone the freedom to experience.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and that could not be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to get into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If you don't forget that people are there for music, this helps us not to forget that you must respect music and what it has brought, without taking into account the fact that you are famous and a rock star, which doesn't really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We have been a group for almost three years and have not published a record before Andrew Woods' death.
There was a lot of frustration because it lasted so little and most importantly is that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think of the amazing person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being, and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose him for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with various proposals and that was the group we loved the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer directly and that must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He's the one who sings the song and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There's so much...
Among the first ones I remember is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I worship.
How has Pearl Jam managed to maintain the grunge despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the grunge word.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the groups I have just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have come up at the same time and, if this is relevant now, I think this is wonderful, because it is a music that is worth listening to and the groups like Mudhoney are doing the best music now than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What's this change for?
This is interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe qualified as very dark songs, even though they can sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you're big and there's a trauma in your life and you lose a parent or a friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs, no doubt, represent this for me.
I also think that we can be happy and even as we can make music dark.
Peru:
Fujimaori was again hospitalized for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he presents in his feet, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who spends 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various diseases, including language cancer for which he has been operated four times and which is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told Canal N of television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in its lower members.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the death penalty for humanitarian reasons, he had no doubt said that he did not want it because he felt innocent.
It has been operated four times as a language cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 kg, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, a pancreas cyst, kidney calculations, arterial hypertension and foot circulation problems, have listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been in lockdown since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 persons due to a squadron of annihilization of the army that conducted clandestine activities during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to consolidate political ties
An official court, headed by the Uruguayan President José Mujica, and made up of various ministers and employers, will launch a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and discuss the political themes of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "proper for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France, which took place when French envoy Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community the countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador from that European country.
Since November, Mexico has presided over the G20, a group of emerging and more developed countries in the world, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan Government has tried to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements to emerge from the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is integrated by countries that do not meet all international tax cooperation standards.
On a commercial basis, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Treaty of Free Trade (TLC) in force since 2004 which has increased the trade of goods between the two nations.
The Mustachu plumbing passes to the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought, unfathomable, for 25 years to save Princess Peach of the evil Bowser's grips, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he would fight for the love of young people in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to shops from around the world, was designed from the beginning to exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character that must say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo originally designed for this support", because so far the successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a fast and fluid part.
Alvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to attract less skilled users.
Once it is over, the most experts will be able to make a "second round" at the level of the game, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users can actually choose between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "do not give way to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario into the three dimensions also implies the return of the character to a mobile console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo makes an eyebrow to the saga fans and repeats the formula of success of previous games, which consists in the fact that the Mustachu plumbing has to go through mining platforms of danger to free Princess Peach.
Even though I find novelties in movements, environments, customs and enemies and also in Luigi's "playable" cases.
Colom takes advantage of the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States' conspiracy for the cleaning of 70 million US dollars.
Thus the trial ends for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that called for Portillo to judge it.
In a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was independent of the judicial and executive authority, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He stated that during his term of office, "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and had given course to all the extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did was an executive approach after exonerating all judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former term of office of the 2004-2004 period.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extracted after having resolved its legal situation in Guatemala and having guaranteed its human rights.
Portillo was absolute for the disbursement of Q120 million funds in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the trial that preceded extradition, but the Ministry of Public Affairs appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity is born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The review of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of the century.
This adds to the long-term employment rate of the current social group.
The anniversary served to balance in a celebrated event in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats, with more than 300 people attending.
Trinijove was born in the District of Trinidad Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping the poor, without work, with drug or marginalized problems.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of heads of entities and institutions that have collaborated with the association over the past 25 years.
The variety of political representations, in the full electoral season, showed the unitary nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Next to the president of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Arthur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the event by former Minister of Social Education, Ernest Maragall and former Mayor of the Mayor and current Eco-Socialist Municipal Advisor, Richard Goma.
We also attend in the large Fabra i Coats room the current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the charity director of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time, and the current one is also, but he added that the work done so far is "a good basis".
The President gave Trinijouve as an example to know how to fight bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it accomplishes," he said.
Property seized by squatters for micro-feste, evacuated
The invaders were suitable for 11 of the 13 buildings in Balmes, 51
The 12 inhabitants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
It seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of Rue Balmes 51 lived was over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they were illegally occupying at noon yesterday, and where they organized micro-fests that would despair the neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for a police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door was changed to prevent the situation from being repeated.
"From this day there will be an access control," said the administrator.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took the electrical installation and part of the water, besides painting the walls and leaving residues of any kind, especially alcoholic drinks.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which would last up to two days and despair of the tenants.
Alongside the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been affected.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that since the building's occupation, her case dropped by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property made him out of disloyal competence, because they sold the glass to three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the place of leisure had to respond to the complaints of neighbors for noise, while according to it, the trouble was not caused by the discotheque clients, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house, and especially the participants at the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in the past weeks, according to the annoying neighbors of the area.
The head of the discotheque explained that the trouble was so great that she even led to an agreement with the owner of the building and that it was nine months ago that he "forgives" the rent.
The Urban Guard (municipal police) has also confirmed that over the past few weeks they have received more complaints from their neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the mayor's PP Alberto Fernández Díaz asked last week "Immediate evacuation of the building to end with the problems of life in common and civil life that it caused to residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last few months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that there were also flights in some apartments.
It is in this sense that it has added that "you must end up with impunity and be implicable against the anti-social behaviour generated in the property".
Also yesterday, Mossos (the Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police moved to Rue Mont-ral's 35th, after receiving the call of a neighbor who had noticed that four people were accessing the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincided with the opportunity of convening beyond the controversy on fees
The municipal competition on the 16 ports reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
Towards the mid-80s, in full view of the already expanded Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration has printed promotion posters from Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the major park of the Metropolitan Barcelone.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park again became, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not focus on the north-south axis, otherwise high (mountain) - low (more).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park unless Yellowstone, with bleedings in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the mayor convened a mega-competition composed of 16 competitions for all doors of access to Collserola.
A door leads to the idea of a park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question was: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organization and with regard to the reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation among all the architects in Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme of which two members of this former cast of elites speak when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions that three architects from Barcelona, university professors, have presented.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is appropriate.
For Roldán, after considering the coastal front "it is necessary" to discuss "the mountain front" because the talk of Ildefons Cerda, that of the green houses was not completed.
"From the base, Barcelona's most extensive park is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," the architect gave the verdict for which the title of "Collserola ports" includes a "lexical piece": it should not be thought of "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which action must be taken".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers that stem from "the uncertainty of public space projection" after the experience experienced in the 1980s and that had been in the Forum area "song song".
The first fear is the own delimitation of the boundaries on which one can be built.
"Limiting something means setting up the next step", that is, its overcoming.
"New urban and planning instruments need to be considered, because the current [as a reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GMP) ] can cause real disasters."
By focusing more on the question, Modol believes that by simplifying the El Valles de Collserola region "can be heard as a park, Barcelona's one, no."
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity the mayor offers his corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the only conduct that enables architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" if this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all success", he says) that we have to create: "We, the architects, should only be an instrument."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because the bases of the competition are missing a global vision of Collserola: "We have convened 16 cross-competitions - he says - in the mountain-mar sense, but there is no longitudinal reading that leads and understands the area as a whole."
This, at least in this case, has chosen to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project for one of the doors to be shocked in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In her opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the band is immediately superior to Ronda de Dalt's, in all its extension, to provide an area of equipment that makes a mild transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives to Jonás Larrazábal and this one will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal authority of the Casino Red granted forgiveness to the mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmails
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the foundation of the legal authority of the Casino Red gives him forgiveness before the Second District Penal Court, which follows a trial for blackmail against the mayor's brother of Monterrey.
After the attack of Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which the alleged Manuel Jonás required him to pay an economic quota so that the Mayor of Monterrey would allow the clandestine operation of the game house.
After the public denunciation, the Parquet opened a criminal trial against the PANiste Major's brother and on September 2, he was arrested and detained temporarily for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Department's Agent 3 of Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State Capital.
It remained there for the next 49 days when a second order of detention was issued after the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs had committed corruption and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the Cadereyta Penal Center allegedly for singing with a million and a half weight of the owners of the Casino Red; but he spent only a few hours in the medium-security detention centre because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, a catch order was issued by the Registrar of the Second District Penal Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to determine Jonah's guilt, such as that concerning the deposit of 1.5 million weights of the game house representatives in exchange for his operation.
On Monday, the foundation of the legal authority of the Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, was presented by Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; thus he could regain his freedom within the next hours.
During the legal formalities, the agent of the Ministry of Public Affairs attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez whether the damage had been recovered and who had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
According to case 197/2011, the legal pardon was granted to Jonás Larrazábal and no claim for the trial sought against him could subsequently be filed; no damages and no penalty would be sought.
After hearing the foundation of the legal authority of the game house, at 15:50 a.m. the immediate freedom of Larazabal Bretón was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolas de los Garza to communicate to Jonas that he had been legally forgiven and his case would be classified.
He will also communicate to him the order of immediate liberty issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome provides details of the air accident in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven others lost their lives.
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other persons lost his life indicate that the helicopter was directly crashing against the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the pales had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuse."
It also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it met the requirements required for the transport of staff.
In addition, he said that investigations in the impact area did not relate to the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a research it has been reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact has been structurally presented.
"The helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to carry them.
The floor had a handle of seven to 30 degrees of tilt.
For the time being, the Secretary has ensured that priority is to have the results as quickly as possible; but the investigation may take a few months, it may even take a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, ensured that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential State operated at a speed of cruising, and this happened on a rising ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal operation cruising at the time of impact," he says.
During the press conference, the SCT holder, Pérez Jacome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
_Visibility unit:
According to aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out according to visual flight rules, which implies that the crew must have visibility during flight and ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the ACM referred to adequate conditions for take-off, and as the aircraft moved to the border area between DF and the state of Mexico, there were low-height nebulosity layers.
Selected paths:
It is likely that "because of the conditions of nebulosity, the crew has sought a lower and more visible area to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the last recording of the aircraft on the corresponding radar, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft residues in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact has taken place on a right and lateral path.
The dispersal model of aircraft residues suggests that the helicopter has crashed against the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No traces of fire or explosion were detected:
In the place of the disaster, there is always no trace in the remains of the aircraft of an explosion or fire type.
The latest findings of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, and the ground had a slope that ranged from seven degrees to 30 degrees of tilt.
The photographs show the sequence in which it may have been disarmed along its route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After a thorough research in a wider area than the surrounding area, there were no dispersal parts of the aircraft, which is the assumption that the impact has taken place under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social insurance conducts an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) announced that it conducts an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the 'Genetic Protocol of Child and Teen obesity' which will allow the markers associated with overweight.
In a communiqué, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital des Specialités du Centro Nationale Constituent du 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, nutritionists and social assistants had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and third-cycle students of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, the population with or without the right to participate is invited to present themselves to the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the evidence is provided to minors every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity took place in the Sports Unit of Nezahualcoyolt (State of Mexico East).
After meeting 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Independent Sports Unit (South of Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (North of Federal District).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and that it was aware of the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors for children and young Mexicans in order to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As the World Diabetes Day was to be celebrated on 14 November, he noted that the goal was to gather three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food-related questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and past family heritage of their diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that cause such disorders as diabetes or renal impairment.
It detailed that Saturdays will be applied to all participants in anthropometric measurements (weight, size, circumference of the size), blood pressure, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (researched to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weighting in the case of minors.
'The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 indicated that in only six years there was an increase of 77 per cent in obesity in boys and 47 per cent in girls; in the case of overweight there was also a dramatic increase', the IMSS specialist stressed.
He noted that the justification for the search for markers was based on the fact that the population of the country was different from others in its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent of Indo-American heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy consumed (calorie), which is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which allows them to detect whether they are overweight or obesity.
It even says that the presence of more dark color (anthosis) on the neck and front arms indicates the likelihood of metabolic and even prediabetic alterations.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, and doctors provide it in writing to parents, to whom each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle they need to make in order to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic disorders: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use transport means instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, i.e. the largest consumption of sugar drinks, carbohydrates (tamals - meat pulp of corn flour wrapped in corn leaves - bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid cassis
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of the environmental and temperature conditions.
If the signals that the paving were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair approximately 200 thousand cassis each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of Valle de México, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry (FQ), who has ensured that if the building and maintenance process of the bituminous pare is adequate, the cassis could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A technological opinion on cassis, organized within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory responsible for developing asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture having similar characteristics to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera considered that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, like some cities in the north, to improve performance, and therefore the formation of cassis.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphalt, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthen, which together give the pope its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, almost 180 degrees, behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees C, its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes falling, it adds.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, the chemical engineering specialist warns.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City were mostly covered by a flexible paving, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involved asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the bed, signal, is bathed an asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it by generating efforts, it allows the forces to spread very well in the paving.
If the asphalt had been modified, the asphalt would be better spread, in the opinion of the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt layer, he said, a last layer called asphalt layer, made of fine stone, i.e. sand, which is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the layer of asphalt and provide adhesion in the street.
As part of the paving that receives and distributes the effort, the rolling layer also requires that the paving layer has an adequate thickness and the material it is made must be treated.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, because they significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil wets, the water spreads inside the layer it is difficult for it to be so, which brings together all the layers of the pail and therefore causes the cassis.
In the process of formation of a case, he said, the first to go is the rolling film and only later the asphalt layer is affected, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Research System explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for case formation and therefore the thickness of each layer of the paddle must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent case formation.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bitumen emulsions, which already exist on the market in other countries and allow for easy repair of the case without having to use high temperatures.
What's missing from Valle's candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that made Melina Ramírez Serna not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle received her Princess's number 14.
Once again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with the fact that she was on the podium of the winners, carrying the crown of money and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico was raised with the crown and sceptre, the department already has 14 titles of Princess and Melina together with a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were found near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, among whom Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alzate (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Mariana Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today, the big question many people ask is:
What was missing? Because the result represents the loss of a great favor that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been chosen in vain Queen of Police and Best Visa Jolie de Vogue, of the titles obtained by the Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the decision taken by the jury of the First Princess Designator is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? posed by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here's the answer from Valle's candidate to this question:
"I read a lot, I think enough in literature, I think it's a form of culture, I definitely think that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it's a pretty deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
This answer did not please first because of the term "culturalize" and secondly in order not to explain specifically how each book mentioned it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony, she said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, what must happen.
And for everyone, read, please a little bit, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the hypotheses launched there is the one according to which Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A Bogota journalist suggested that being the preferred ovation, ovation and candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best crafting costume, and Queen Mother), "it woke up the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen, and that's why she didn't shine on the stage."
And this was noted in his first presentation in a bath tub on Hilton beach and his two performances of the crown watch.
Although she had found herself at the two shows, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the program "Como en casa" (As at home), of the Canal RCN said that the fact that Melina was designated Princess "confirms that the candidate who receives most of the prizes during the contest does not receive the crown of queen".
Moreover, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about its interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That is why two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not sufficient in a Miss Colombia, we need to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, which is already involved in projects before the start of the Competition," she explained.
It is also said that Valle has sinned by his faults behind him and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury chose him as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queens' preparation Jorge Hernán Orozco recognized that Melina had no better body, that there was better, "but her problem with the abdomen, which was actually not too familiar to me, left her points the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the Cromos magazine considers that the error of the Valle candidate was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"The surgeons are good, but Valle couldn't do them.
Her body has never been her ass and she has lost because of this."
For this price, that the National Beauty Competition returned for the first time, after the dance show in the bathroom, there was a cruel prediction that took place last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo made to Melina not to give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina today begins a year of rule, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will go through history as one of the queens who, despite her wandering passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A dactyloscopist from Cali went to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano'.
The work of these officials is crucial.
Last November 4 a Dactyloscope of the Cali CTI went to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Chief of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", comparing his fingerprints.
Seven dactyloscopes working in the ITC's local offices this week were the "available" tour of Eliaszar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Choco, where he had to spend more than five days in the forest to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after having followed appropriate courses, he specializes in dactyloscopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. the thumbs and feet.
During the week of the operation against Alfonso Cano alias, Eleazar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter in Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to take the card with the ten digital prints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the site of the body, he did not recognize it physically, because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed as a peasant of the area, without glasses and much more left.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian wolf, the Incre, a picker and a lantern, Eleazar compared the body's digital prints to those on the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the Supreme Chief of the Farc.
Looking for the print
For a dactyloscope of Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eleazar González at a press conference for the operation against "Cano" is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without a margin of error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, dactyloscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals have false identity cards or no documents.
We take their digital prints and search the database.
The researcher said that in a case of theft he had to remove a part of the wall from a house, because in this place the thief had leaned his hand to get out a chest full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to draw a digital print, but in this case we were able to get the print from the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in various flights," he recalls.
Prints may also remove or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently we found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
Through the investigation, it was determined that a parent could be suspected of crime and indeed a printing on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he is the killer, it places him on the scene of the crime.
A CTI dactyloscope explained that "the digital prints of objects were extracted with chemical or physical reactives".
When they appear, a lift or a band is used to pick them up.
Later, the prints are sent to Asif, the decommissioning database, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still a lot of undocumented Colombians," the ITC expert said.
He explained that everything is not how we show it in the CSI TV program.
Since everything that shines isn't gold, all we touch isn't necessarily a print.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
"Indigned" Defends Authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators were knocking in front of the place Zucotti to camp there.
A large part of the people entered the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupe Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to reenter, through a judicial order, instead of Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Great Pompey.
Hundreds of demonstrators were knocking in front of the place Zucotti, where they wanted to access a court order that allowed the 'indignant' to camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a more park north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp again in the place, we're going to install us somewhere else and we're going to continue the legal struggle to return to Zucotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokesmen of the "Occupe Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the 'indignant' to the evacuation of their camp, personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the camp and allowed protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, the 'indigned' occupied a new park located in the confluence of the Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Dutch tunnel, which unit New York and New Jersey, owned by the Trinity Church parish.
At least one hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved in and arrested some demonstrators, even though Bray was unable to confirm the particular figure, ensuring that he had seen some journalists who had also gone through the minots.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of people who have settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders has moved in support of the members of the movement and has tried to intervene in their behalf before the Police.
Meanwhile, the Zucotti Square - which is a private property complex - remains closed pending the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled by this Tuesday during which the lawfulness of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
A few demonstrators so far were carrying and distributing copies of this court order at that time, and they even delivered it to the officers who were monitoring the scene, which caused 'some small confrontations', said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials had hit the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting the members of Occupe Wall Street or from applying 'published laws after the occupation began or from prohibiting demonstrators from re-entering the park with tents or other properties they used previously'.
Major Bloomberg pointed out to the press that because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and protesters, but he warned them that local laws did not allow them to be installed with tents and sleeping bags.
The City Councillor has personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn at Zucconti, an operation during which 200 persons were arrested and which was decided because the protesters were 'violent'.
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered the evacuation of the place because it became "a place where people didn't come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to harm others", because "some shops had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"The evacuation of this morning at dawn has been repulsive and shows that the Bloomberg fund is more interested in defending financial interests than those of American workers," the spokesman added, who accuses the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
The officials of "Occupe Wall Street" also indicated that they do not intend to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with the community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17th.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special TV program of Noel
Next to Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", succorist in "Baywatch", lapin in "Playboy", married to rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special program of Noel of Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, next to the "croner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be released in the television program "It's Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 interpreting a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed pictures of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide Internet dissemination of a private porn video in which she appeared with her husband back then, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed as the Virgin Mary by supporting a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian Indian comedian who recently presented a part of "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, appeared as Joseph.
Next to Anderson and Peters, the special program of Noel de CTV also presents the Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from the controversy itself.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian 'pute' during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan resumed after the earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of decline from the beginning of March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, still overwhelming after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the country of Japan since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo have estimated the material losses of $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have slowed down.
After three consecutive trims of falls, data from the Gross Domestic Product between July and September have been used to definitively turn the page: GDP has increased by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous trimester and by 6 per cent at annual rates.
The recorded second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also assumes the largest rate of increase since January to March 2010.
Recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1%, compared to a decrease of 0.9% of the capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real incentive of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, to use the constraints to create zero.
Japan woke up mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable has increased by 1%, due to increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The scale of the yen
Tokyo has become a single market when the yen - the Nippon currency - has become one of the "refugees" elected by the investors who have fled the debt crisis in the euro area and the unforeseeable forecasts of the United States, a privilege that weighs as a share in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic fleet line is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their low scores between July and September.
While markets continue to be established in the peripheral EU countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lose its custody.
"The risks that persist, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa, yesterday.
And actually, the prospects are not quite encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of member countries presented clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the world economy's inflation points highlighted that the main powers are being inhibited.
Because it dropped four decimals to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone was even below the average, which is at level 100, and is down to eight decimal places up to 99.13 points.
Athens Again Feeds Doubts
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but the conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With the risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to join the maze that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is imposed by Brussels's demands rather than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday, pointed out that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of 100 days set out in his appointment could be short to apply, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, would ensure that he was not going to support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his requirement for new elections for the scheduled date of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit," Papadimos said when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to stimulate employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not cast doubt on his position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are committed to nothing more."
The conservative leader has gone a step further than the EU and the IMF, the agencies that need to unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently needed, and has clearly said that he will not approve any letter of commitment to the adjustment.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the entire Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible".
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors would return to Athens "very quickly" to discuss with the new Government "the elements needed to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, even if there was no final date.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen underlines Spain's "preponderant" place with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a world-leading place in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofía recalled that in the last two decades, the country has become the world's second donor in terms of this instrument of cooperation whose " essence" resides in the fact that it is "an instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all mankind, based on trust in human beings".
The Queen opened yesterday the V World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "an absolute necessity" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals for 2015, and, "very particularly, in the one that aims to reduce half the volume of people living with incomes under a dollar per day, to which the "poor threshold" is fixed."
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofia, who hoped that initiatives and contributions originating during the Summit, which will continue until Thursday, "guarante the creation of new capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "a lot of goals" and "we face many challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" must be promoted.
Thus, His Majesty explained that by the end of 2015 there were 175 million poor families who had access to these financial services and that 100 million of these families had come out of the poverty line in which they now live.
The impulse in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneer way" by Muhammad Yunus, pointed out Queen Sofia as a "act of justice and recognition due".
And she described the father of this instrument as a "beautiful idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she had known since 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed one year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the qualifying "family head" meeting in Valladolid of the "bank of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofía ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in seeking solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, it stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered microcredit as "a serious and rigorous policy for poverty eradication", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not allow it to be the victim of compression.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded the "success" to give "trust" to the "people to whom everyone closes the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that "opens its contaminated doors of the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President for universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, the chancellor but also president of the Christian-Democratic Party.
Europe's future was not originally planned for the programme, but was forced in the fall, especially to satisfy the militants who judge the government's policy too laxative to the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Management Board, was adopted in almost unanimous terms.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which they were entitled, following their interventions, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, did not leave the doubt.
The idea-master of the chancellery - and of the motion - is in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less than Europe but more than Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "time has come from a breakthrough in Europe."
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission to the universal suffrage "to give a face to Europe".
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress whose inspiration is obviously Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Septs will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile there and CDU leaders believe Nicolas Sarkozy is also.
But the jalon is set.
Likewise, delegates rejected to an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country to the head of the European Central Bank on the basis of the weight of each economy, which would, of course, increase the weight of Germany.
Concerned about the climate within its party, the chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but it has not sought to win its congress on the back of the "little" European countries or countries in difficulty to criticise the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except for a creux.
Remembering that there were two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What is the fraud of disease arrests?
After the allocations, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on disease arrests.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be at Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance box, and to give a talk on the theme - which has been repeated since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which is part of a desire to make savings in a harsh context, but not least announces an axis of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority wants to focus on disease arrests.
First of all, for budgetary savings: the government plans to impose a fourth day of shortage on private employees before taking over employment.
Clearly, without a specific business agreement, a sick employee would lose four days of salary, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could cause anger, but that would make it possible to report EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos.
And which would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic: to impose a non-remunerated day of absence on employees in the event of a job termination (they do not have a period of absence up to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also relaunchs the subject of fraud, targeting the abuses associated with the termination of work.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will be reimbursed," Xavier Bertrand warned the RTL micro, Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the ad seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of fraud at work stops.
This has been the subject of constant and offensive political follow-up since 2002.
The French are no more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's wait for the national figures first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than €237 million of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Research and Documentation, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008 with EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% were for maternity leave and work accidents, and 54% were for disease arrests, which amounted to €6.2 billion.
And so 2.5 per cent of health expenditures.
In 2010, the French met an average of 14.5 days of work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that conceals some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by Monster.com career management site, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees questioned said they had not taken any sick leave days.
Another study, this time of Disease Insurance , states that in 2010, 37% of the disease arrests were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months, and 11% above.
When compared with their European neighbours, the French employees are no longer inclined to leave work.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two NRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for reasons of health or non-health) in France was between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud of disease arrests represents very little in the face of work in the black.
With regard to fraud, she's only reaching a small extent.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks on disease arrests for more than 45 days.
In 2008, over 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 made for short-term decisions were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of orders of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, 11% of cases were "unadjusted or unjustified" over 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, 169,000 "unjustified" cases involving several million employees who have had a disease arrest.
A figure that represents very little, for example, that of work in the black.
According to MPM Dominique Tian, the author of a report on the issue in June, he would represent EUR 9 to 15 billion of a year's tax deficit, which is more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore more than fraud to the latter.
Papadémos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to remedy its economy.
This is what the Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said before Parliament on Monday 14 November, adding that the hundreds of days given to his union government would not be enough to carry out this task.
"In order to continue efforts to re-establish the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budgetary adjustment," said the head of government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Mr. Papadémos predicted that the country's public deficit would be reduced "to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right to refuse new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, supported the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not engage in an additional austerity.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with the Members of his party, New Democracy.
It agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, and to combat waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who has predicted that the IMF and the EU will not unblock the €8 billion loan needed without written assurance from all the parties that they would support the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras replied that his speech was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide, says an expert committee
Canadians live in the disgrace of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In the field of palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in the disgrace of death.
Only 9% of Canadians accept to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make provision for this.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the choice is made, to a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the start of the game, experts quote a recent survey of the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
If Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death".
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we report the experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire that most Canadians die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying at the hospital.
Overall, it is in Quebec that this rate is the highest, with 86% of the deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already said that they want nothing to change in the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or suicide involving persons who are not competent or consenting.
On the contrary, the report co-signator Jocelyn Downie said yesterday at a teleconferencing conference that there would be more cases of these violations precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Uthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in Euthanasia
Let us recall that 85% of Canadians have already spoken for euthanasia because they believe that it would allow people to ease their suffering in the end, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the life of the elderly or the disabled is of less value.
In the case of persons who have committed suicide, the respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the maintenance or cessation of a patient's care, the situation is less clear, says the authors of the report.
In the list of their recommendations, they also suggested that it be indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there was a legally valid refusal is not a criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect non-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the field of palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or terminal sedation, which has already been widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some health experts have already issued reservations regarding the findings of the report of the Royal Society of Canada experts.
Pierre Deshamps, a health specialist, described the position of the signatory experts in the report as "extremely," among other things, because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminal disease.
"It opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who was more than 18 years old could ask for help in suicide," said Me Deshamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
I also stress that the authors of the report seem to place the individual's autonomy above all the other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
But, "in society, he says, there are scars and constraints."
The Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she described as "pro-Euthanasia manifest."
Margaret Somerville, who is himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly answers the report on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, both in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls President Assad to leave power
Damas denouncing a plot
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bachhar al-Assad's supporters showed up in front of the foreign affairs department's premises yesterday.
Diplomatic pressures intensified yesterday on Syria of Bachar al-Assad, which, with the support of Russia, resists and denounces a "complaint" against the country.
Two days after Syria's suspension by the Arab League, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbours of Syria, took a stand in favour of President Assad's departure.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call President Bachar al-Assad to "quit power" in Syria, where forty civilians and members of the regime were still killed.
"If Bachar had a keen interest in his country, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighbor of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For its part, Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, head of diplomacy, complained that Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime had failed.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, alluding to Syria, a neighbouring country in respect of which Turkey adopts an increasingly tough line.
The United States welcomed a "strengthening consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime", following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, of countries such as Turkey, adopts an increasingly tough tone" in the face of repression in Syria, Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Department of State, observed.
During that time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces perished in the Deraa region in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians were killed "in the trades of shooting and shooting at heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the occupied city of Homs, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem felt, however, that the country was "directing towards the end of the crisis".
He also reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damas from his work, which he considered to be "a non-hazardous".
Syria "does not flex," he added, ensuring that "the golden plots against Syria will fail".
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe also expressed support for the sending of United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that he believes is in "paranoia".
A new special meeting of the League is scheduled to be held in Rabat tomorrow to take stock of the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces of the city in the wake of the protest and release of the arrested protesters.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, judged yesterday as "inaccurate" the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while maintaining support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time for Italian markets and sacrifices
The future leader of the Italian government, Mario Monti, called for some time in the markets to train his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover lost credibility in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussions with the political parties yesterday before meeting the trade unions and employers today.
It should set up a relatively limited office composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti talked about an important program with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the interviews, after meeting the President of the appointed Council.
The President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said that he expected Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr. Monti's presentation of a limited list, undoubtedly a dozen ministers, to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bonds yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are specific time limits" to prepare a government and its programme, he stressed, saying, "some markets will be patient and understand."
His appointment by the president had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern over it had taken place, in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The designated prime minister should be a team of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government must last until 2013, the date of the next legislation, has it considered.
According to the President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will obtain Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mr Monti has undertaken, once he has entered into office, to work in the urgency and in order that Italy "becomes a protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance objective in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for, inter alia, new measures of rigour.
The Italian "pattern of patrons" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot meet the deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), is a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the serious challenge" and another "Italy", according to editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy is due to place EUR 200 billion of state bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a useful detonator with a nuclear weapon, said on Monday an American NGO specialized in atomic risk.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA reported last week on its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, which was widely available in IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk, Ural, and would have been involved in the manufacturing of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to set up a company producing nano-diamants in Kiev.
His company's economic difficulties would have led him to contact the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then have cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA refers to "strong indications that development by Iran" of a nuclear detonation system "was assisted by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technique well but who, as a Member State informed the Agency, worked during the core of his career on this technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin".
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased from almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence slightly decreased or slightly progressed, according to FBI statistics made public on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, 49 per cent increase, against a 13 per cent increase in Catholic violence, a 4 per cent decrease in crimes against Jews and a total increase of 14 per cent in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, 47.3% of which are motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbed to see these crimes and crimes increase again," said Human Rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the organizers of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses," he added, considering that this could lead to an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in American federal law is a legacy of the time of the fight for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish racial violence, skin color, religion, origin and now sexuality.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging Twitter website introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday, in particular to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service a little more like Facebook.
A new "activity" and another "name" tab allow you to follow more legibly, directly the activity of the other "Twittos", the netizens who follow the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This lets you know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast throughout the network on Monday, AFP reported the Twitter password, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to recast a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making the happiness of the initiators, opens to a wider audience with a more comparable handling than that of the big public Facebook and Google+ networks.
On the network, users were discussing suddenly "tweets" about the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Activity will help me better track some elements of my Twitter stream," @dannykronstrom sent.
Austria
registration of a "gold" budget in the constitution
The Government of the Great Social-Democratic/Christian Coalition to Power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "gold" budgetary rule in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid possible degradation by Austrian sovereign notation agencies (triple A).
It is the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who even announced this decision after a council of ministers, whereas the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, far above the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had been reduced only by one crane, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros of interest every year," argued the vice chancellor and Christian Minister for Foreign Affairs Michael Spindeleger.
Austria thus submits a request for a summit in Brussels of the member countries of the euro area last October: the Heads of State and Government had then claimed the registration by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of equal value.
The arrangement adopted by the Austrian government is closer to the "German model", Germany having been the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017 onwards, the federal government's structural public deficit will not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states and the municipalities will have to submit budgets at balance.
The objective is to transfer public debt to Horizon 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen hard
Noda threatens a new intervention on the change market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again on the change market if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene as we have done the last time if we detect excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Mr. Noda explained in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose not far from the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo has sold large amounts of yen against dollars in order to lower the value of the Nippon currency that had just established a new record of force since 1945 in front of the green ticket.
But the yen has been regularly raised since, doubled by the purchases of investors who consider it to be a "refuge value" in these times uncertain global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar is passed over on Tuesday under 77 yen and the euro is brought down under the symbol bar of 105 yen, near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
This fluctuation of the Nippon currency night for the archipelago's exports because it costs the products Made in Japan and reduces the value of foreign revenues from Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan struggles to rebuild itself" since the earthquake and tsunami of March 11 that devastated the Tohoku region (North-East), Mr. Noda, who is afraid that this increase in yen does not kill in the eggs the fragile recovery.
The third world economic power declined with the growth in the third quarter -1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a surge of exports and consumption of the households that were hit by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considered that the Yen's ransom did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan".
The Minister of Finance Jun Azumi, for his part, called the Japan Bank (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting on Tuesday of its monetary policy council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, predicted that BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", making it clear that no additional monetary relief was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last final meeting in October, the Emission Institute increased by 5,000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion) its acquisitions of Treasury bonds, making up to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euro) the ceiling on the purchases of various financial instruments to finance the liquidity market.
Euro area:
rates fluctuating, stock exchanges flanging
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis is still the European index.
Despite the designation of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of fragile countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchanges are a little more in negative territory, on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC lost 40 per cent to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt is 0.4% and London is 0.1%.
"With the new tensions on the performance of the euro area States' borrowings in difficulty, the world's stock markets continue to make some of their recent gains."
" Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contamination," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down by 0.7%, with renewed fear of market participants on Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
" Japan, like the rest of the world, has a wide eye on Europe, and exchanges will continue in a narrow corridor of variations as long as investors do not have evidence that the situation is stabilised," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This concern over the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro has evolved to its lowest level for a month and a half.
At around 10 a.m., the European currency is $1.3570, representing 0.4%.
According to the brokers, she withdrew after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, meeting in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion providing, inter alia, the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Italy and Spain's borrowing rates remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of Italian obligations at 10 years of age is 6.85 per cent, that of the Spanish titles of the same maturity 6.2 per cent.
These tensions on the interest rates of the countries of the South, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, called for time for markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened by asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October would be the " main task " of his government.
Spain is in the market view line, while legislative elections are held Sunday in the country.
The gap in rates ("spread ") between 10-year-old obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new higher historical level.
Waiting for growth figures in the euro area
Statistics, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, which is slightly better than the expected 0.3% of households.
However, the Insee revised the number of the second quarter to a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And it's really the fourth one that worries the most economists.
Germany, on the other hand, has recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must be carried on the dogmas
Whether it's a subject that can't be dealt with from short-term considerations or under emotion, it's energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy for an electoral meeting to be an opportunity to reflect on such issues and on the place where the nuclear is held.
The debate will only be beneficial if it explores the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their views on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic evolution will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless it deprives a large part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, the reduction of fossil resources will have to be halted in order to continue to produce "electricity at all times, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a missing subject of the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case with Belgium, which is subject to the need to be able to find a source of replacement capable of replacing itself, nor with Switzerland, which just means to build only the centres of the last generation.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote only them, pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to their park by accepting the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts the speech.
Berlin's choice will result in a rise in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence on the increased use of imported gas, in particular Russia, a bond of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all these false effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be meditated.
Europe's oil champion, with 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to wind interference, according to which its CO2 emissions and its electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours are paying an invoice of more than 40% electricity than that of the French households.
While in a globalised economy, the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the maintenance of the industrial tool in the national territory, French companies benefit from the least expensive electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction on the nuclear side would result in a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make it illusory the beautiful declarations on the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, since they do not express any opposition to this energy, the polls show it.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has allowed us to build an industrial network of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 inducible jobs.
Strongly exportable, it leads to a galaxy of specialized SMEs in international markets and makes them very creative of non-replaceable jobs.
If France had decided to leave the nuclear plant, it would have sacrificed many of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion euros per year of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to operate for sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of production of miraculous electricity, no more than there is no diabolical.
The development by Areva of low-emission solutions of CO2, nuclear and renewables demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a Security Authority that exercises an intransigent and transparent control over existing centres as well as the Flamanville building.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are obsessed with the same obsession of security.
In the mid-century, the nuclear industry suffered three serious accidents.
One, Three Mile Island, was involved in normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human flaws caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that have caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn the lessons of this accident, as it had done for the previous two.
This approach and cooperation between the security authorities, the French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a concept that makes it possible to withstand such phenomena.
While it is considered by all the electricians who wish to build a power plant, the conclusion of its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them free to take the lead in the irreversible development of the nuclear plant.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow the emotion, dogmas and actions of partisan to dominate a debate as crucial for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised in various angles - the increase of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the number policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "people's rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who have done the actual thing, the Minister of the Interior (read Release of May 23) proclaiming in the passage that France "does not need foreign talent, masonry and restaurant servers".
But it is only rarely analyzed under the economic angle.
There is a fairly broad consensus between the left and the right on this issue.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who would declare in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "can't welcome the whole misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by Polish plumbing bands was shared to the left as well as to the right.
For both sides, immigrants are regarded as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is to the degree of generosity that will be granted to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande is able to deal with banality, indicating that the code-development will solve our "migrating problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be paid in an election; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall it in a recent book summarizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting immigration encourages growth and employment at night.
Fears of the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they are at risk of replacing themselves with national workers, especially those who are not qualified, with lower pay pressure.
But the experience shows that immigrants are, in fact, much more complementary than national employees, which are mainly engaged in jobs in poor employment sectors.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the job offer.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will have trouble working in a country with a shortage of anesthetists, these complementaritys between national and migrant immigrants have a positive effect on national wages and employment.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows results in an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% of real long-term wages.
And this is not to take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a strong proportion of immigrants naturalized among the American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that in Germany, an immigrant aged 30 will make a net contribution of EUR 150,000 to the average public budgets for the rest of his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term of office, to look for the missing growth points "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, using to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, still thinking European democracy
Democracy is a precious asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonists in Greece.
Some have believed that it would be sufficient for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct manner possible.
It is known, since Napoleon "the Little", that this was an easy thought.
Universal suffrage, in order to be the necessary condition for democracy, is not enough and can even become "an instrument of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, Light, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we live in is an economic crisis, but it is, first and foremost, a crisis in politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true Greek referendum would have had in this regard a double value: that of the need for a strong return to politics, but also that of the feeling disturbed by its incompatibility, its incongruity.
This ambiance must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today, and for many of them, the Republican soldiers are no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and scattered order.
A white-sitting to the absolute European monarch or a foot-sitting joint in the void of the nationalist reply: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want copper but a common exercise, full law, serene and continuous, choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we could no longer stop the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is all Europe that is attached to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which is due to its impunity and its lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is all Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore to popular sovereignty the pilotage of the European project.
As a whole, Europeans will be able to reduce their debt burden, free up their markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The outcome of the crisis will be decisions at European level which will not be taken without total democratic legitimacy, except for course to lead us to disaster.
After a long struggle with this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today demands the European economic government.
Let's go.
But thinking about it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such by citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
To make the Republic of France, the Republic had to "do" the Republicans.
The Revolution in Interests could not be sufficient.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe politically, a real European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
Smart cards "without contact" are generalized
The world hall of the Puce map opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card...), more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart firm.
The most powerful segment is that of wireless technology that allows you to pay transportation in common or to regulate its purchases by simply approaching a reader's card.
This year, 460 million cards without contact should be sold around the world, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to continue to grow in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the global market for card cards (6,925 million cards).
For a long time on the Asia-Pacific train, Europe earns the land for payment without contact.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the initials are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Visa have been deployed.
But the big surfaces put double holes.
Carrefour thus issued 2.5 million pass cards this year without contact.
To get to higher speed, banks now have to equip their customers.
"Two large French institutions have undertaken to systematically spread their bank cards to their customers in the future, equipped for wireless contact," says Gérard Nebouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology needed to perform transactions.
"They took the delay."
"But they should finally know a true essence next year."
"We have tables on sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhone of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a tube allowing the payment without contact.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society, too, said yesterday to prepare the market for an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact with their mobile phone.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is expanding
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida to the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-term suspects, the links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram confirm.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algeria has now "acquired certainty".
"The way both organizations work and the information services reports show that there is good cooperation," he explained without any further clarification.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French in Niger in January would have updated the passports.
Kidnapped in a Niamey restaurant by near Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day as many of their admirers were killed during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the demise of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of past calls is aimed at several interlocutors based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are particularly interested in the investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has long stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, a Berkeau of Boko Haram and the other to a man who is called near Aqmi and the sect.
"It's an advance, but it's no doubt worth waiting for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect has benefited from external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" have been increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or in its operating modes, which now involve the use of more complex camikades or explosive devices and billing than those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting from Washington, therefore pressured Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of little-interested lighting.
A Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in Haoussa means "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is very successful.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for the charismatic while its militants engage in the fight against the wicked central government.
The latter aim first at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's militants were particularly active, multiplying attacks on the commissioners.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, no nuances.
The army invests in the city, there are 800 deaths.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was arrested alive, was killed in prison.
Then the sect will radicalize and leave its fiefs from the north.
In the last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 Jos, then another one in Abuja.
In June, it was still in Abuja that Boko Haram took it to the security QG of the police during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria now concerns all security specialists.
While Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, that the Somalis of al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppe warned against Boko Haram and said "to share all the information".
The world according to the Republican candidates to the presidency
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival with simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
To listen to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe that.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying tones and shorts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong republican point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often non-stated - fell.
Mitt Romney, the best in the race for the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to bring the Chinese before the WTO and challenge them "for the manipulation of their currency", a theme that is a leading theme in an America experienced by the migration of its entire industry to Asia.
So much for whether this should involve the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador to Obama China, and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has failed to stand out against an attitude that "flashes" emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stands in the depths of the polls, remains unheard of.
To Reagan image
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran, he's fanned."
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing his obligations to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows him a embarrassing ignorance of the files.
Recently, he called against the Chinese military threat because Beijing "trys to develop a nuclear capability" - apparently ignoring the fact that China has held military atom since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who is supporting Israel and wants to fight against Iran, says he is willing to engage the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign politics.
The opponents of the current president claim that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine on anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of the "boys" of Iraq, on his disturbances in Libya, and thus attaching a low label to him.
But the attack isn't that easy.
The population is rather positive about Obama's national security budget, which has eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been in favour of military intervention that leads to the adoption.
And by arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama hits more just.
The North Stream, new entry door for Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, directly linking Western Europe to Russia by going to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with burst.
More than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, took part on Tuesday on the Baltic coasts, between orchestra and buffet, at the inauguration of the North Stream, this new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia to Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart of the Netherlands Mark Rutte turned together the wheel of the valve leading the entry of the Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas will reach every year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1,224 km related to the region of Saint Petersburg in the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerian.
A second tube is due to be completed at the end of 2012, allowing to deliver a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, the equivalent of all French consumption.
The possibility of building a third on the same route is already mentioned.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and time of this huge construction has victory airs.
The project had been strongly challenged by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The North Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose a little of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
As far as the debate is concerned, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare North Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact ", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But it is at the price of a weakening Europe of energy, as the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has, in five years' time, triumphed over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, highly gas-consumers, whose deposits are declining.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically," said François Fillon, inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles shown by the Gazprom leaders, present in number in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical plant.
The underwater tube is made of concrete steel to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It is located on the bottom of the sea, 200 m on average.
In order to build it, it was necessary to avoid areas of mines dating from World War II.
" One hundred had to be removed or destroyed by caution," says Jens Müller, spokesperson for Nord Stream.
There was also a need to multiply measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which doesn't stop at all its length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned outside Sweden, but the project was rejected by the Swedish authorities, while the Swedish were not willing to see a Russian state company permanently established across their coasts.
"In case of emergency, we stop the gas passage in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of escape, the gas contained in the gas pipeline thus escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builders who have planned the dives to know a escape every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the state of the gas pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, trained by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus circulating inside the gas pipeline.
In the form of a cigarette, it is inserted inside the tube, wide with a diameter of one metre, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters second, it provides detailed information on any deformation of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without having to undergo the least repair.
Gas flow is simply secured by pressure.
It is 200 bars away, and 100 bars on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each), joined.
These five companies created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented to this company, for 20 years renewable, the total capacity of gas transport.
" Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline was made up of 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work should be EUR 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to return to their expenses, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy side planted with pines.
Valves, heights of 4.5 meters, form the gas outlet.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that occurs before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since Tuesday, this terminal has received a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
With full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a stamp.
Founded 15 years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give up the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a booze.
The Moleskine Carnet is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white color, as old by time.
However, the Moleskine book as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a book of design but distinguished notes.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is responsible for launching the new product.
The book is inspired by an old production technique, the soft skin (skin skin) that denotes a paint cotton used to cover banquets for example.
This type of book was very popular for writers and travelers.
" Moleskine gave to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the avant-garde artists, until the 20th century " , says Maria Sebregondi, who became responsible for the fashion brand.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million pieces.
We are far from the confidential production of the first few years, where only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish the buyer's portrait, as the notebook of notes seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
In the image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, now has nearly 100 offices in Milan and New York since 2008.
She distributes her books in the bookstores, from Fnac to small downtown shops, and has been able to impose her identity.
"We have followed the weather and this new need for writing, despite the e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition " Detour " where architects or artists exhibit their own book.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Benefiting from its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has managed to diversify its products: bags, calendars, styles, computer houses... The brand falls on a range of supports.
A success that has been desired: in the fall of 2006, Mode Modo was purchased by the Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th week for the employment of persons with disabilities is open today.
Despite a voluntary public policy in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is twice as high as the average: 19%, compared to 9% for the entire population.
Discouragement?
“No,” said Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, “the association that organizes the week for the employment of persons with disabilities.”
" Progress made for fifteen years has been considerable. "
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
" Nevertheless, it still remains enormous to do."
It must be said that for disabled unemployed people, obstacles remain many before access to employment.
They are older than they are: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the bacca and of the 2.3 million higher education students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria that specifically complicate the return to employment and that "are the core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help businesses recruit disabled workers.
That's for the target brakes.
It remains the non-dit, the mentalities that evolve, of course, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Enterprise Association for the City indicated that interrogated managers have " a low level of knowledge of the disability " , with a " overrepresentation of wheelchairs, mental or intellectual disabilities " .
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the employment goal of 6% of disabled workers, set out in a law of 1987.
The last known figures, dating from 2008, account for a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," said Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of " taxed " institutions, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
" The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc.
" But this improvement also translates a real awareness, especially in large groups. "
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of the institutions of 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of the enterprises of 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What a joy!"
Before facing the Blues Tuesday night (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of providing them with this friendly match.
We won't even write that there was a connection between them, but the image is symbolic.
Nearly on the street of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have made peace and peace.
Five months after the humour gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian selector only has praise for him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and his Belgian status."
"I want to go ahead," says Lillois.
As for the contrast between its benefits in the club and selection, "it's a whole, is it justified?"
"In Lille, I've been there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I must take my marks."
Manned against Romania Friday night for this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "bright."
However, do not ignore the notion of "please".
The Blues have encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supportive," he says.
This is part of strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
As far as in front, "there's Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he rapelle-t.
"We crossed everything at the time."
"Can play against them, it's just happiness!"
With good manners, Leekens has for his part referred to the "fire".
"I'll fight a game of gala."
"Feurte" also found - as a "voisin" - that France is "becomes a very high-level team" a little more than a year after Knysna's traumatism.
"Laurent Blanc did a toner job," he was excited.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would well share the plane with the Blues management... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians get big," he said.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You're going to report it at the next match." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Porto de Paulo Bento begins with a lot of optimism his barge of return to Bosnia (22h00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the process, the two teams had failed to realize it.
" At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selectçao, which has been on the sleeves since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is indeed only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to start.
In view of the match to go (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it appeared clearly that the games are not done.
Portugal has dominated the party for over an hour, of course, but it has been unable to mark this objective so precious, which would have relieved it.
"It is a good result, however, which carries a certain risk because we have not marked purpose outside "
But at their bright Light Stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of a public who should be there as bluffing as well, even though the party obviously announces "very closed," said a optimistic but bright Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take it up," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have 50% chance of being in the Euro 2012 " , but still relativized Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The zero reported Friday in Bosnia obliges Portuguese to mark and win.
No one can suffice the Bosnians, who also need to mark.
"It is a good result, however, which carries a certain risk because we have not marked purpose outside," regrets Bento.
"We are going to play against a team that has many technical qualities and has many players with many individual qualities," he added.
Like Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on Bosnians to "don't give them time to think."
A good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic, this time.
