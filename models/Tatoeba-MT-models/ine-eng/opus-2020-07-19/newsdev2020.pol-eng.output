Bosnia and Herzegovina protests Croatia's plans for the storage of radioactive waste
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northern and western Bosnia in protest against Croatia's neighbouring plans to store part of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known as natural beauty.
The protesters in the Bosnian city of Novi Grad demanded Croatia to charge the construction plans for the construction of waste in former military barracks in the town of Trgovska Gora and declared the fight against the project.
The facility would contain waste from Krško nuclear power plant.
The Bosnians, holding banners with the words "I want a healthy future" and "Stop – (river) Una needs us," said that the storage of radioactive waste can endanger the Union's river and the lives of about 250,000 people.
We don't have to say,
He told the crowd Miroslav Drljac, mayor of the village of Novi Grad.
We must fight to protect our way of life and our Union.
Located in Slovenia, the Krško power plant built in the 1980s is also suitable for Croatia.
The representatives of both countries will meet next week to discuss additional waste storage issues.
Croatia's public television HRT said on Friday that it was not yet decided whether to build the waste storage on its own or to pay for the storage of part of the waste in a new facility built by Slovenia.
Croatian Minister for Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told reporters that Croatia also has a problem with the utilization of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes for a comprehensive solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents on each side of the country of ethnic division insisted that Croatia find another location in part of the country near the power plant.
"Why does Croatia throughout its territory claim that this is the best place in Bosnia?" asked Drljac.
We can't let them down!

US Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 F-35 aircraft
Congress of the United States for a statutory 15 days since the approval by the State Department of the possible purchase by Poland of 32 multi-stakeholder F-35 did not object to this transaction, which means that the last condition was met before the start of the purchase negotiations.
The Congress's decision, although it wasn't unexpected, is of great political importance.
"After approval of the sale by the State Department, and now by Congress, I see no more serious obstacles," said John V. Venable, Senior Counsellor for the Defence Policy of the Washington, Conservative Tank Heritage Foundation.
The expert explained that under the 1976 Arms Export Control Act, the federal government, represented by the State Department, must notify Congress of any planned arms sale abroad for 15 days before signing the contract if the value of such a transaction, in the case of the sale of arms to the NATO Member State, exceeds 50 million dollars.
The value of the proposed purchase of 32 F-35 fishermen by Poland is estimated at 6.5 billion dollars. This amount includes technical and logistical assistance, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of F-35 - if this transaction is finally finalized - will be the US armed group Lockheed Martin, and its sub-manufacturer is the manufacturer of engines for F-35A F-35A fighters Pratt and Whitney.
The proposals for the purchase of American fishermen of the fifth generation F-35, on behalf of the Polish authorities, have been tabled by the Minister of Defence Mariusz Blaszczak in May.
The Polish offer was discussed in June of the current year at the meeting of President Andrzej Dudy and President Donald Trump in the White House.
If the agreement is finalized, the Pentagon representatives will be held under the Foreign Military Sales Programme (FMS).
As part of the FMS programme Poland has already acquired the Patriot anti-racite system.
The price of one F-35 hunter at the time of submission by Poland of the purchase offer was – without weapons and technical assistance – approximately 89.2 million dollars.
As the US military experts who wanted to maintain anonymity informed the PAP, the price given in the preliminary negotiations was "a maximum price, much higher than the price to be negotiated".
"The prices are falling violently, currently the price of one F-35 is below 80 million dollars, much less than Eurofighter, which does not have the benefits of F-35," said Venable.
The PAP spokespersons hoped that the final negotiations on the purchase of US warplanes by Poland would end this year.
The possible participation of Polish sub-contractors in this transaction, i.e. offset, will be addressed directly to the US F-35 fishermen's producers.
What is the replacement team of Munich, referred to in the series "The Payton Hobart Choices" on the Netflix platform?
The caregivers and parents with the above disorder seem to be sick of their healthy baby.
The "Wybory Payton Hobart" series is on the Netflix platform today.
He tells the story of Payton Hobart, who wants to become president of the United States, but first he has to become president of the student self-government in his high school.
In Ryan Murphy's series, the creator of "American Horror Story" and "Glee", we'll see Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platta and Lucy Boynton.
Without revealing too many details for those who have not yet had the opportunity to see the show, he is moving on the subject of the Münchhausen team – a mental illness that occurs in caregivers, who act as if the health person concerned had been affected by a physical or mental illness.
There are different types of this disorder, such as the Munich team that is responsible for causing symptoms of the disease.
The Münchhausen team is being simulated by the fact that the person who remains under our care has certain concerns.
It is also called a invented and caused disease, and it is viewed as violence against the child.
It's a rare disorder that usually involves a parent who's taking over symptoms or causing symptoms, so it looks like his child's sick.
What are the symptoms of the Münchhausen team?
The symptoms of this disease may vary, but NHS points to the following examples of behaviour:
Convinced medical staff, however, that a healthy child feels bad.
To heal or to invent symptoms.
Falsification of the results that the child is considered to be ill, e.g. administration of glucose to urine samples, to appear that the child has diabetes.
The onset of symptoms of the disease, for example by giving children the necessary medicines and other substances.
How often does the Münchhausen team show up?
It is difficult to estimate how often this disorder occurs because many cases of the disease are not reported.
The study published in 2000 showed that 89 cases of this disorder occurred in more than two years.
What should be done if a child is suspected to be in danger?
Contact the local special services department or call the NSPCC child protection infoline with the number 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Police raid at school in Kadunia, evacuation 300 children
Kaduna – The Post Office of the State Police in Kadun carried out a raid yesterday at Imam Ahmad Bn Hambal School, located in Layin Maidubun Tsumma, Riga, Igabi's government district, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
The police have claimed that the children were in a highly dehumanizing condition, and the authorities of the school objected to this claim.
“ They don’t tell the truth because all the children were there for the parents ’ approval, ” said a resident who applied for Shehu.
Before the children were admitted to school, the form was signed.
Parents brought food to their children every day, and they knew what conditions they were in.
We were extremely surprised by the arrival of the police and the evacuation of the children, as well as the removal of the whole food of the students delivered by the parents before the school was closed.
That's not right, because parents can tell if their children are in bad shape, as the police say.
He added that the former Commissioner of Police Abdurrahman, who once visited school to check the level of child care, never had a reservation.
He claimed that the children were studying the Koran and nothing else.
However, the Posterunka Posterunka de Poliči d. Public Relations, Yakubu Sabo, admitted that after the birth of the government, children would join their parents.
‘They shall be kept under dehumanising conditions in the name of submission or acquisition of Korean knowledge.
Many of them had scars on their back, which proves they're beat.
That's why we're studying school to get to know her owner," he added.
Foreign talent important for China's development
Guangdong is the leader in the country in terms of attracting foreign talents largely because of the Pasa and Szlaku Initiative (BRI), the Great Gulf (GBA) Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao area and the new role of Shenzhen as a pilot demonstration area.

Rachel Rommeswinkel from the United States began her career as a blogger on the subject of hate in Dongguan and has over a million fans on Bilbili and Weibo.
She said in her films she would continue to share information about Chinese traditions, culture and technology.
Leticia de Lassus, of France, head of JJB International Montessori AMI headquarters in Guangzhou agrees that “the education of children is like the stopping of the court.
If you turn the first button off wrong, the rest of you will never get to your right place.
The American of Chinese origin Henry Xiao believes that in the very centre of the GBA, his company can enjoy many privileges with regard to new rules, government policies and capital resources, and in particular talents.
The producer of the "Nanta Show" dinner program Sean Choi from South Korea said that Guangdong's cuisine is known worldwide and the introduction of the "Nanta Show" program in Guangdong was a good decision.

Seimonika: Tusk or Kidawa-Blonska will be president
"I believe that Donald Tusk and Malgorzat Kidawa-Blonski have the chance to win the election with President Andrzej Dud," says Thomas Seimonik.
Vice-Chairman of the Population Platform Thomas Seimonika in a conversation with Polsat News spoke about the affair with chief NIC.
‘The case is discriminatory for Marian Banasia.
He can be the minister of culture from some entertainment, not the chief of the NIC, or the minister of finance.
No one is responsible for billions, for taxes," he said.
"This case is a very serious state crisis," he added.
Seimonak also spoke of the candidate Claudia Jachiry.
‘Antoni Macierewicz is on the PiS lists.
A man who didn't just say things, he just did them.
He was the head of the former SKW for spying on Russia, destroying their lives, destroying their families.
Why doesn't anyone appeal that Antonie Macierewicz is not on the list?" he asked.
“People of us young people have different aesthetics.
I think Jachira, who's one of the things she's already apologized for, feels that sometimes she's overstepped.
Let's not do this campaigning problem," he added.

"Adolescent" masked child rapist from Central Coast forced to look at his victim in court
Dressed in a masquerade, a man caught a 12-year-old from the back of school and dragged her into dense growth in Central Coast in May 2017.
Then he tied her to the tree and raped her.
Soon after the arrest, a search warrant was carried out in his home, where officers detained a number of important items for investigation.
The man was convicted of seven charges related to the attack and three other charges relating to the presence and use of another girl, aged 11 years, between August 2016 and August 2017.
The 12-year-old victim went by the way, and when she looked behind her, she saw that she had suddenly left her closet armed with a large fork and a knife.
When she prayed "stop, stop, stop," she caught her neck and forced her into adulthood.
The man said: “Don’t yell.
Don't yell, because I'm gonna have to hurt you."
Holding the knife in his right hand, he tied his hands and his feet with cables, and then he tied it to a tree, and he attacked it for almost an hour.
When he cut her off, the girl ran to school with a hysterical scream.
The man got to work around 9.30 without answering a few texts and contacts from his colleagues.
His clothes were dirty and had traces of grass and wood, and he himself claimed that he was involved in an attack on the road, where he chased another driver in the bushes and fell off the cliff.
The next man's trial will take place on Tuesday.
The Pope calls on the executive directors of technology companies to use artificial intelligence for the common good
On Friday, Franciszek warned the executive directors of technology companies, diplomats and financiers that, with the pursuit of artificial intelligence and other forms of digital achievement, there is a danger of increasing social inequalities if, in its course of ethics, the common good is not taken into account.
Pope Francisk delivered those words at the Vatican conference, where government envoys and representatives of Facebook and Google, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethics, participated.
A small group of scholars and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered participants at the conference "The Common Good in the Digital Age".
This one-day event is the latest evidence that the Vatican is interested in the debate on the perspectives and threats related to artificial intelligence.
It discussed the technological achievements in the field of war art and the future of work, which will play an increasingly important role in the machinery, as well as a study on the case of the attack at Christchurch in New Zealand and decisions taken by companies owned by the social media in connection with the spread of the film recording the massacre.
During his talk at the Pope's conference, Francisk praised the potential for technological progress, noting that the machinery at the beginning of the industrial revolution saved workers from dangerous and monotonous work.
However, he warned that increasing dependence on robotics in order to achieve gains is the risk of losing people’s dignity at work.
"If technological progress would become the cause of increasingly visible inequalities, it would not be real and real progress," he warned.
If technological progress was to become an enemy of the common good, it would lead to an unwanted insanity of some kind of barbarity under the most powerful law.
The organizers of the conference expressed the hope of using the expertise of the participants and identifying potential future advisers of the Catholic Church in matters related to high technology.
Martin Odegaard, a winner hired by Real Madrid, is running fans in euphoria with his effective assistant.
Martin Odegaard recorded an impressive assistant at the opening goal of Mikel Oyarzabal.
Winning 2:0 with Osasun, Real Madryt climbed to the top of La Ligi table and continues to be a passion for being uninhabited in his own battle this year.
However, despite the uncertainty and failure of this season in La Liga Zinedine Zidane, there is a huge pressure on the wall-star Garethem Bale as a result of the stormy pre-season period.
The situation reached a point of view when Real Madrid was humiliated in the Masters League by Paris-Saint Germain (PSG).
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid have real talents at their disposal – for some of them the French have plans, for others not.
Vinicius Junior is an example of such a star of the future of Real Madrid and is currently playing in the team.
However, the Norwegian young player Martin Odegaard, who was loaned to the Real Sociedad, caused a great stir, counting an incredible assistant in the La Ligi game.
During the meeting of the Real Sociedad with Alaves Martin Odegaard he performed an impressive assistant at the opening goal of Mikel Oyarzabal and Real Sociedad finally won 3:0 before his own vision.
After taking the ball on the right, Martin Odegaard disarmed the player from the opposite team, placing a net on him, and then sending an amazing amount of power between two other racers and his teammates just left to deliver his leg.
The second gate of Williana Jose and the third in the performance of the incredible Oyarzabal, this time from the criminal execution, provided a decisive victory for Imanola's underage before Manu Garcia was sent out of the box five minutes before the game ended.
Martin Odegaard joined Realu Madryt only as a 16-year-old in 2015, but he had difficulty trying to meet the expectations of fans.
Now, at the age of 20, the Norwegian footballer finally seems to feel safe on the battlefield.

Is this God's punishment?
What does the Church say about suffering?
Cataclysm, serious illness, child's death.
It's dramas that cause a lot of suffering and it's hard to understand.
We're asking, "Why?"
Sometimes we also hear that "God did so."
Does the Creator send us misfortunes and diseases?

Murder of two children.
An attempt to kill four children and all the vows to get rid of them.
I am practically convinced that each of you will be punished at the right time for several times the life-freedom penalty."
It shall determine whether or not it will be a penalty for an indiscriminate deprivation of liberty without the possibility of conditional release.
The verdict will fall on October 12.
Poseł PO Krzysztof Brejza is the guest of Cesar Gmyz
"As a result of the campaign of written lies, I appear with an invitation to czezar Gmyza," said Krzysztof Brejz on Twitter.
The reason for the call is a statement by the publicist Cesar Gmyz on the TVP antenna.
One of the leaders of SokomzBuraka is Krzysztof Breiz, who has a great experience in the hate department.
“People who are perfectly familiar with Marius Kozaka-Zagozda – the founder of “heterski” profile – are Kierwiński, Budka and Guertych,” Gmiz said.
SokzBuraka is a social page and profile with political memoirs and jokes.
As the Networks say, there's a PR officer Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda behind the profile.
"We have been able to learn that since April, Mr. Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda has been employed in the Warsaw city office, in the marketing office," he wrote a week.

Boris Johnson addressed to the police department in charge of the close relationship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The independent IOPC police authority shall examine the possibility of initiating an investigation against the prime minister explaining whether, during the administration of the public authority as mayor of London, it was allowed to commit a criminal offence.
The Council of Great London (GLA) stated in a statement that its supervisory inspector registered the Prime Minister's "procedure issue" in connection with charges of preferential treatment of Arcuri arising from their close acquaintance.
“The question of ‘procedure’ can be referred when information on the possibility of committing a crime appears,” he said.
That doesn't mean it's proven in some way.
IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to examine this matter.
The issue was addressed to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against members of police services in England and Wales.
She was transferred to the police surveillance authority because Johnson was then acting as the appropriate police commissioner and criminal commissioner.
Johnson objected to his close relationship with Arcuri as if it had come to any irregularities.
He said earlier that he would apply to the London City Council's order and provide details on his relationship with Arcuri, but he relied on the Council's being "accomplished on the wrong problem".
The order is followed by the report "The Sunday Times", that Arcuri, an American who moved to London seven years ago, received 126,000 pounds of budget money, and privileged access to three foreign trade missions, which were then headed by Mayor Johnson.
As a result of this report, the government has frozen a grant of 100,000 pounds for the hacker house of Arcuri.
The government is waiting for a difficult question about the verification procedure carried out before the grant of the funds.
Minister of Numeration Matt Warman said in the Gmin Chamber that his department's employees "usually maintained due diligence" and that the company has a British phone number.
According to numerous reports, however, the number was transferred to the office in California, where the 34-year-old Arcuri is now to live.
The close relationship of the Prime Minister with businesswoman "was a secret police staff."
The GLA decision to refer the matter to the independent IOPC police department met with dissatisfaction at 10 Downing Street.
According to the source of the higher rank of government representative, it is "a politically motivated attack", and its term, prior to the Conference of the Conservative Party, is "clearly political".
"The supervisory inspector did not present any supporting evidence of the charge, and the prime minister did not receive a chance to reply to him before the press release late Friday evening," the source said.
Neither citizens nor the media will be able to apply for such a clear political statute.
Today, in the early hours, journalists The Standard said that the close relationship between Johnson and the businesswoman from California, who was assisted by the London Tourism and Promotion Agency, was for the employees "the secret of the polyskinne".
London & Partners (L&P) said that Arcuri was given a place during Johnson's foreign trade trips as mayor, despite the fact that her company was then not considered "trustworthy".
Third accused of drug offences in connection with Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) – As a result of the last year's death of rapper Mac Miller, a third man was arrested and accused of committing drug offences.
According to court documents, Stephen Walter is suspected of selling fentanyl-treated oxycodone pills, which Miller had in his possession before his death in September last year as a result of accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, that is, a strong opioid responsible for the “epidemia”, which buried several thousand human beings in the United States.
Walter complains about the delivery of pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
The court documents sealed Tuesday reveal that Petttit received drugs from Walter all August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City in Arizona, is suspected of playing the "curier" role of Walter, who delivered the pills to Pettit.
Neither man was directly accused of causing Miller's death, nor did any of them present defense lines in his case.
Walter, who was subject to a 2005 drug exemption, was arrested and was further sentenced to five months' imprisonment for violating the conditions of release.
Prosecutors who are dealing with the case, which they first brought on Thursday's TMZ Celebrates website, are required to keep Walter in custody waiting for the trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of the accused's escape.
The reply to the message left to the automatic secretary of his lawyer did not come immediately.
Pettytus was put to the federal court on 4 September, and his defendant refused to comment.
The words of Miller's novels are sincere talk about his depression and drug use, which makes him a fan of the biggest hip-hop stars.
From Pittsburgh Miller, who was really called Malcolm James Myers McCormick, for two years he was left behind by the songwriter Ariana Grande, who finished earlier in 2018.
After his death in the Instagram portal, she published an exciting film with the participation of Miller and the creation of "Thank U Next", in which she mentions him with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death has been linked to the abuse of opioids in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, a guitarist from 3 Doors Down, also died as a result of overdose in 2016, and his body identified the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodone.
This Article is amended as follows: the correct wording of Walter's name is "Stephen", not "Steven".
9-year-old Nigerian creates over 30 games on mobile devices
9-year-old creates a game of fun in a hidden with free Scratch 2 programming application.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories in online or offline mode.
So far, Basil has generated more than 30 games for mobile devices.
There is a netoper in today's game, which is hidden according to the program.
The player gets a point every time he grabs a bat who gets out of the hideout.
Making a game I learned at the accelerated course.
"Now I create them when I'm bored," Basil CNN said.
In March, Dad wrote it on a five-day accelerated course for children from 5 to 15 years of age.
The course, organized by Codefest International, aimed at providing children such as Basil, access to new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Basil Okpara senior, claims Basil played a lot of games on mobile devices.
“When he was 4 years old, I bought him a tablet because he always picked up the phone and played on it.
He played a lot in Candy Crash and Temple Run," said CNN father.
But Basil's interest in the creation of the game grew when he was 7 years old and got a scholarship for spending all the time on the game.
"One day he played on the table, as usual, and was so overwhelmed that I was upset," said his father.
With anger I said, "You're still just playing, can't you think about creating your own games so they can play it for others?"
Speaking those words, I was upset and didn't think he'd take them seriously," he added.
Since then, Basil has shown an active interest in the science of making his own games, has moved parents to purchase laptops and to write it on course, during which he learned the basics of making games.
Basil, who in the future wants to be a scientist, gives his flock a title based on their contents.
One of his games, "Mosquito mash", is available on Google play store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world, and, like Basil, this population includes innovation leadership on the continent.
Recently, two Nigerian 12-year-olds were celebrated for using codes to create work-sharing robots at home.
In May, the Acrobot team from the secondary female school in Ghana won the Robofest 2019 competition for the programming of boxes.
And thanks to the growing investment of giants in the field of technology, such as Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and its evaluators are on a good path to a career of coding stars.
Former presidents of the Republican Party in the North Kingdom admit to the corruption lie
From the documents submitted on Friday, it follows that the president of the Republican Party in the North Kingdom will be awarded in court that he has lied to federal agents investigating the corruption of the main political donor.
According to Robin Hayes, he's supposed to admit himself to guilt in the future.
From a document containing a factual basis prepared under the defense agreement and signed by Hayes, Hayes found that Hayes knew he was making a false statement to FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The defence agreement has been sponsored, and there is no factual basis to which Hayes' accusations are admitted.
Initially, he was accused of conspiracy, corruption, and false testimony.
The prosecutors accused former Congressman Hayes of participating in the plan of the insurance company's authority to direct the data to the campaign in the main country of the insurance market regulator in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two partners were accused of trying to repurchase Mike's State Insurance Commissioner.
Lindberg is the founder of the insurance and investment company, which has been one of the main state-of-the-art political donors in recent years, who has been transferring more than $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He supported mainly the objectives and policies of the Republican Party, but also gave thanks to the Democrats.
His lawyer did not respond to a Friday e-mail request for comment.
Defender Hayes Kearns Davis did not respond to Friday's e-mail request.
Of the court documents filed on Friday, Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he did not talk to Causey about employees of the State Insurance Department.
According to a document containing Hayes' factual basis, he actually spoke to the insurance commissioner about Lindberg's request for changes in the staff employed by the market regulator.
The prosecutors claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg organize a meeting with Causey and that he talked about the trap directly with the regulator.
According to the April Act, Lindberg demanded special treatment of his insurance activities and planned to transfer up to $2 million to a renewed Causey campaign in 2020.
The contested act also states that the contract also contains a request for an amendment of the department's official who controlled Lindberg.
The future Republican Causey has announced a alleged attempt to corrupt federal agents and has helped them to collect evidence on the matter.
He wasn't charged with any charges.
According to Lindberg's complaint, Hayes ordered him to transfer $250,000 to Causey's campaign during an interview, where Lindberg and Causey were also present.
During Hayes' conversation, he initially protested, claiming that the transfer of such a amount of money would draw attention, but as the case has shown, he finally stopped.
"Whatever you all want to do, we will do it," Hayes said, according to the indictment.
"Okay, I'll take care of it."
The Federal Prosecutor's Office did not respond to the e-mail request for further information on the agreement.
The conductors will go to the first section of the new burial site.
The drivers from Saturday will be able to use the first of the three constructed mountain sections of the S7 expressway, the new Zakopanski – from the Skomielny White to Rabka Source and further the two-day main road accelerated to Chabówki.
As told on Friday by the spokesperson of the Krakow Department of National Roads and Highway Directorate (GDDKiA) Ivana Mikrut, this is the first of three sections of the S7 built south from Krakow, from Lubnia to Rabki Source, which will be given for use.
From more than six kilometres from the White to Chabówka Squad, more than one third, i.e. approx.
2.3 km, it was run on the wires.
Seventeen of them, including the longest and highest, are located at a distance of 50 m high, and four small objects on the banks of the Scomielna train.
This has led to the carriages to Wadowice and New Judges, to national road No. 28 and to the old DK7.
From the next branch, Zabornia, you can go to DK47 towards the New Market and buried and to DK7 to the South and the border of Slovakia.
In the Zvějeky Mountains there was a place for travel MOPs.
The road of expression ends with the Zabornia branch in Rabce Source, to which it was built about a mile of a two-day fragment DK47 in Chabówka and is included in the existing two-day Chabówka – Rdzawka.
The section S7 Skomielna Biała – Radka Srój and the new section of National Road No. 47 of the accelerated main class (GP) from Rabka Srój to Chabówki was built by Italian company Salini Impregilo from Milan.
The cost of the investment amounted to about 615 million dollars.
The quality assurance of the work will be valid for 10 years.
Counting approximately 16.7 km of the new fragment of Zakopianki, including 15.8 km of the expression path parameters, was divided into three implementation sections, each with its own contractor: Lubijn – Repair, Repair – Skomielna Biała and Skomielna Biała – Rabka Zrój.
The first section to enter the tunnel is carried out by Poland – the Ukrainian consortium of companies: IDS-BUD S.A. from Warsaw and the ALTIS-HOLDING Corporation from Kiev, the tunnel section – the Italian company Astaldi, and the third – the Italian company Salini.
The total cost of these tasks is nearly 2.5 billion dollars.
The investment is co-financed by the European Union Funds under the Operational Infrastructure and Environment Programme 2014-2020.
The amount of funding is over 1.3 billion dollars.
The entire section consists of 38 engineering facilities (bridges, wiights, stakads) and a two-room tunnel of 2,06 km long.
According to the directions of the road manager this year, the 7.6-kilometre section of Lubien will be available – Repair with a temporary integration into the old DK7, which drivers will limit the construction of the tunnel.
The last section, Repair – Skomielna Biała with a length of about 3 km, drivers will leave in 2021, after completion of a two-room tunnel with a length of about 2,06 km.
Our goal is a state of well-being
"We are building a welfare state in Poland," said Zbigniew Ziobro Minister of Justice.
He came to Szczecin to call for a vote on the council of Darius Matecki, a candidate for the Sejm from the Law and Justice list.
"The programme of a good change is the implementation of the Polish version of the welfare state," the Minister said.
"We want the Polish to make a lot better for their lives to be at a higher level.
This is necessary because otherwise young, dynamic, well-educated people will leave Poland, and we cannot afford to do so.
Our government has consistently implemented a programme that was committed to carry out four years ago.
We said we'd put in the 500 plus program.
Platform, Donald Tusk and Eva Kompcz said it's impossible that there's just no money.
We proved that the money was and was, but the PO did not care about those to whom it was due."
Ziobro also recalled the manufacturing for children and the thirteenth retirement – and that the fourth retirement is also planned.
In addition to the "disrupting share of national income", PiS priorities are a just state and economic development.
The money should not be given to a large stream of selected pockets, which have a good relationship with the institutions and authorities, but should be given equal access to the whole society – the policy has been established.
Emmanuel Macron presents Jacques Chirac's money
French President Emmanuel Macron congratulated his predecessor Jacques Chirac on Thursday's television presentation, calling him a great Frenchman and a great man of state.
At 21 o'clock in the cold for the former president, the lights of the Eiffel Tower went out.
The former president and Prime Minister of France Jacques Chirac died on Thursday morning at 86.
Macron's happy performance broadcasted all of France's most important television channels.
"He was the husband of the state we loved, just as he loved us," said the president.
“For more than 40 years in politics, Chirac’s face was close to us.
And whether we split his ideals, his battles, or not, we all recognized each other in this man.
This evening is a night of gratitude for Jacques Chirac.
He did so much for the nation, for our values, brotherhood and tolerance," Macron continued.
He reminded Chirac that in 2003 he opposed war with Iraq, which had no mandate from the UN, to pursue peace in the Balkans, stability and peace in Lebanon.
Before a television show, Macron went to the Paris apartment of Chirac on the streets of Tournon.
In the south, the National Assembly honored the former president's departure with a minute of silence.
The Palace of Elisha will be open from 21 a.m. to Sunday evening for all those who wish to enter the Condolence Book.
"The President of the Republic wants the French to be able to give a tribute to Jacques Chirac, who left today," reported the press services to the Palace of Elias.
The palace was the home of Chirac for two presidential appointments from 1995 to 2007.
President Macron announced Monday the day of national mourning.
In the south will be the holy Mass in St. Sulpicius Church, and official worship according to tradition will take place in Notre-Dame Cathedral, which since April, when the fire broke out there, is closed to the public.
Jacques Chirac's annual funeral will take place next week; the exact time and details are not yet known.
Part of Sopock Street in Nisko after the construction
On Tuesday, September 24th, the Sopock Street in Nisko was officially launched.
The total value of the task was 803 thousand gold, with a million 26,000 gold being FDS funding, while the remaining amount was its own contribution from the Netherlands and the Gminy and the City of Nisko.
Thanks to the measures obtained, the area of 1284 metres has been completed, along with its extension, a corridor of 950 metres, drainage and finishing work.
The investor was the consortium of companies: PBI Infrastructure S.A. Z Krasník and PBI WMB Sp. z o.o. z Sandojerka.
In the course of 2019/2020, the Nadia River will take a further stage in the construction of Sopocki Street, where a new surface will be constructed, a corridor and a bridge will be rebuilt on the Barcówka River.
For these work, the authorities also managed to obtain funding from the FDS, at 80% of the total investment value.
They took part in the annual tour of the rebuilt road: the Mayor Robert Bednarz of the Netherlands, Deputy Mayor Adam Mach, President of the Council of the Republic of the Netherlands Sylvester Dasko, Chairman of the Board of Osijedla Malce Jan Bielak, Staff of the Department of Civil Aviation and the Board of Civil Aviation in Nisko, Investigator and Supervisor.
Facebook with a feeling of user self-esteem hides for a sample of favorites
As part of the first experience in the world, which aims to improve user self-esteem, some of Facebook users will soon see no number of favorites, reactions and videos.
Favorites will be hidden and visible only to the post author, and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar test carried out on Instagram in July.
A new version of Facebook launched next Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, director of Facebook's privacy in Australia, said that the change is the result of a study on self-esteem and the opinions of mental health experts indicating that a number of favorites can be compared to others.
"The clothes from the many groups that cooperated with us on the fight against obesity, as well as those in the field of mental health, were really positive," said Garlick.
The elimination of this numerator makes people focus on the quality of their interactions and on the quality of content, not on the number of favorites or reactions.
It is expected that sharing with others through the platform will be more enjoyable and will not be taken as a rival – it has been stated.
Garlick has ensured that companies that support Facebook activities will continue to receive the same indicators and observations that they have had access to so far.
She stated that it was too early to be able to determine whether the test would be extended to other countries, as was the case with Instagram when the test was carried out in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As with Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication when the experiment ends and whether the change will be introduced permanently.
"The user's initial comments on the new rules in Instagram were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to the opinion," she said.
Commenting on the site of the world experiment, Garlick said that Australia has very active, technically well-known Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that this is an incredible country that provides us with measurable opinions indicating whether the new experience is valuable for those who benefit from our services or not.
Frequently: Councils want compensation for pilgrims
It is often not commenting on the Council's appeal to Abpa Wacław Depo for financial compensation for the support of the waste economy in the pilgrim season.
The city demands 1 zł from pilgrims.
On Friday, he spoke at a press conference, including the leader of the Spring Robert Biedronia, organized on the leading side of the Spring Mount of the Most Holy Mary Miss, vice president of the city council and candidate for Sejm Lukasz Kot.
As he reported, the SLD council had voted appellate to Abpa Wacław Depo on the transfer of the city of one gold from each visiting frequent pilgrimage – to support the work of urban, municipal, etc.
We accepted an appeal to Archbishop Depo to help the city, helped us clean up the pilgrims, run the town for the pilgrims.
‘Please refer to the budget of the symbolic city of gold from each pilgrimage.
This will enable them to enjoy better living conditions in Chęstochova," said the Vice-President of the City Council.
Asked for a comment by a frequent speaker, Mr. Mariusz Bakalarz, who initially prepared a few questions, he then asked, as he pointed out, at the order of abp. Depo, to replace her with information on the content: “Until we receive the official position of the city council, we do not refer to the matter”.
According to the project on the site of the frequent magistrate of the appeal to Abpa Depo, "the provision of financial compensation for the city of Frestoch for the operation of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season".
"In view of the increasing number of pilgrims arriving in the Common Pilgrims and the increasing costs of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season, taking into account the city’s views among the residents and residents, the fins and fins, we would like to offer participation in the generally accepted canons of care for our common good, the small parent of the Commons, in the costs of the garbage management system," the petition said.
"In order to maintain the purity of pedestrian tracks, which move by pilgrims, while using small infrastructure, i.e. external waste bodies, we present a proposal for symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system in the amount of 1 zl from pilgrims," it said.
"In addition to the participation in annual costs that the city covers from its own resources, taking into account the purity and aesthetics of the urban area, and in order to emphasize that such cooperation will benefit all parties, we declare that 20% of the amounts will be allocated to improving tourist infrastructure, for example by increasing the number of publicly available public toilets," the Council said.
They noted that, in addition to the financial issues, their proposal was based on the numerous reservations made by the residents regarding the condition of the roads that move by pilgrimages.
"In view of the purity of our city and the possible positive effects of cooperation, the Council of Common City calls on the Archbishop of the frequent metropolitan Wacław Depo to send financial compensation to the city of Commons for the support of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrim season," was reiterated in the appeal.
According to information from the Press Office of the Spring Mountain throughout the year, 834 thousand people attended the sanctuary in 200 general Polish pilgrimages.
About 124 thousand faithful ones arrived in 255 pilgrims.
More than 8.8 thousand people arrived in the frequent cycle pilgrimages (133 groups) and 440 people (16 groups) in the race pilgrimages.
A total of 20 people reached the sanctuary, and more than 170 pilgrims from two groups – on the rolls.
"Knowledge" TVP mentioned the Federation when describing the survey
According to a poll conducted by Pollster, in the elections to the PiS Sejm, 45% of the votes, KO 26%, Levica 14%, PSL 7%, and the Confederation 5%.
Even on the "Super Express" portal, the poll was conducted for the crossing of the electoral threshold.
In the main edition of "Knowledge", describing the same survey, only the first four parties were presented, completely ignoring the Confederation.
The leader, Edyta Lewandovska, made it clear that only four committees crossed the electoral threshold and would enter the Sejm.
The VAT also showed the division of seed mandates without taking into account the votes given to the Confederation.
It would give PiS self-government.
In commenting on this whole situation, Mr Bosak spoke of "public compromise on honesty towards society".
"They started with a "moral revolution" puzzle," he recalled and said that this case was a sign of weakness.
In turn, Robert Winnicki wrote on Twitter that "The "Knowledge of the TVP" in further actions against the Confederations shame Urban and Michnik".
He also drew attention to the lack of legal reactions of journalists.
"But let us also look at those who allow silence.
These ‘rights’, ‘independent’, ‘insubordinate’.
In a few years they became a more primitive version of all that they fought at midnight," he added.

Brother sentenced to life penalty for honouring the social media stars Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star by means of a photo published in social services, was released in July 2016.
The Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was convicted of her murder on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment for the most vocal "honor killing" in this patriarchal country.
Baloch, who gained his fame by publishing bold selfies – Greek according to Western standards, but in a powerful misogynist Pakistan considered to be provocative – was exasperated in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
A few days later, he said during a press conference that he had no conviction about his actions and declared that "of course" he had murdered his sister and that her behaviour was "acceptable".
His lawyer Sardar Mehmood informed the AFP that the court in western Multan considered his client guilty and sentenced him to life in a long-awaited judgment.
"Inshallah (if God permits), will be executed by a higher court," he said.
Earlier, Baloch's mother, Anwar Mai, announced to the AFP that she hoped her son would be executed.
“He is innocent.
It was my daughter, and it was my son," she said.
The murder of Baloch has hit the heads of world information services and renewed calls for action against the so-called honour killings in which victims, usually women, are killed for breaking patriarchal social principles.
Women were burned, raped, shot, or flogged for crimes such as choosing their own husband or, as in the case of Baloch, for bringing their family "hate" through a manifestation of their own sexuality.
The murders are usually committed by a close-blooded man.
According to Pakistani Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (repealed) they can ask the nearest victims for forgiveness.
Three months after Baloch's murder, Parliament adopted a new legislation imposing a life imprisonment for honorary murders.
However, whether the murder will be recognized as an honorary offence remains in the presence of the judge, meaning that murderers can theoretically resort to another motive and be executed.
In the case of Baloch, her parents initially insisted that their son be shown no favor at all.
However, the bereaved feel that they too can lose it, change their mind, and declare that they want to get rid of it.
The international outrage caused by the murder has led the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and to announce that they have fallen with their parents, forcing them to move forward.
One of Baloch's most well-known works is to offer a stripper to the Pakistani cricket team and to wear a decolonized purple dress in Valentine's Day.
It was criticised and threatened, but many, including young people, viewed it as a violation of the country in which the position of Kim Kardashian can be considered a bold and political movement to strengthen the position of women.
The root of the "honor" killings lies in tribal social standards that still dominate South Asia, and in particular the behavior of women, although men can also be victims.

Anarchia doubles the number of displaced persons from northern-western Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
On Friday, the United Nations organization reported that increasing violence has resulted in a doubling of the number of displaced persons from northern-western Nigeria to about 40,000 people in the last four months.
The United Nations Relief Agency has found that concerns have created "a new exceptional humanitarian situation", which requires an inter-agency effort to raise new funds by the end of the year to $35 million.
Babar Baloch, spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamic grouping of Boko Haram, which has been taking place since decades in the northern part of the country, is not responsible for the recent attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfar and Katsina observed over the past 10 months is rather the result of organized armed groups.
"It paints a frightening picture of anarchy and uncertainty," he told reporters on Friday.
He reported on frequent reports of kidnappings, tortures, forced executions, murders and sexual assaults by attackers who also destroy homes and stolen property.
The army and the police were sent to fight gangs of criminals in the region.
However, the army is withdrawn from fighting Boko Haram and from the Islamic state in West Africa, which separated itself from its former group in 2016.
"The graduates do not come with the names of the groups," he said.
They're coming for it with stories of monsters.
Most of the refugees arrive at the neighboring Nigra.
In his statement to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, he said he hoped that more people would flock to Niger in the coming months, along with the worsening security situation, in particular in the state of Sokoto.
A new date has been set for the investigation of the male accused of killing women and 2 children
A new date has been planned for the investigation of a man from Guatemala accused of killing the state of Iowa and her two children.
According to the Act of the District Court of Polk, 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellan is charged with the first-degree murder of the first-degree floor, as the authorities claim, with a false name, which he originally gave to the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't admit it.
According to the police, he shot 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter, and her 5-year-old son at their home in Des Moines on 16 July.
The court's documents show that the new date of the case, i.e. on 27 January, gives representatives of both sides more time to prepare.
The officials of Immigration and Customs Services in the United States claim that Escobar-Orellana is illegally staying in the United States and was deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was sentenced to illegal entry into the United States.
"The Sun": Boris Johnson in the face of a cabinet bomb that wants to reduce demands for brexit and reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
In just three weeks before the final summit of EU leaders among the most important people in the country around the Prime Minister, there is a growing fear that he will not have enough time to get more important concessions.
Boris Johnson faces the risk of a bomb on the part of the office that wants to reduce demands for a break and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
In the negotiations there was an impas on the new customs system, which would replace the backstop mechanism for Ireland, because Brussels has defined the proposals for other provisions offered by Johnson as "inexhaustible".
Ministers of the Crown expect EU decision-makers, headed by German chief Angela Merkel, to offer you a compromise as a three-year deadline for the backstop mechanism recently criticised by the tourist leader.
The Sun journalists spoke with three different cabinet ministers, all of whom are preparing to confront the Prime Minister after the annual tourist conference next week in Manchester.
The "aggressive" strategy developed by his close advisor, Dominic Cummings, who is trying to apply bluff to the EU and threaten to leave the Union without an agreement, will be demanded by the Prime Minister and then accept the offers made by him last moment by the Union.
One of the cabinet ministers identified the verdict of the Supreme Court of Justice on Tuesday on the termination of parliament's suspension as a "warning signal" and added: "The only way to leave the European Union on 31 October is to do so on the basis of the agreement.
We never beat arithmetic in the Gmin Room, which works for our own benefit.
The Prime Minister must now swallow and accept what he is able to get.
Aggressiveness doesn't pay: it's obvious that the Cummings plan burned down on the groom.
We can't fight on so many fronts.
The second cabinet minister committed himself to hand over to Johnson to try to break the deal with former Prime Minister Theresa May, unless everything else is said.
The minister said: "If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to re-present the agreement proposed by Theresa May in the Gmin Chamber."
There are many opportunities for her to vote, and everything depends very much on the end of this subject.
If we're forced to extend the deadline, it's the end of Boris Johnson and the end of all of us.
John Major accused Boris Johnson of not taking negotiations seriously.
In a momentary speech, the first minister of tourism said: "The Prime Minister tells us that he wants an agreement with the European Union.
But we don't see him sitting in Brussels and working on it.
Instead, he has been working with cattle in Scotland, checking the eggs in Wales and fighting with citizens on the main streets – everything in the world’s eyes, as if he had already been campaigning for good."
The speaker of the current Prime Minister admitted yesterday that the agreement was still far away, and added: "No one should be deceived: a very long way to ensure agreement."
However, the speaker also said that the Benna Act introducing a three-month delay in the absence of an agreement "actively weakens our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: "There is no doubt that this law makes it difficult for us to negotiate, but despite it, the prime minister, together with his colleagues, is still trying to make progress."
Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today, where more talks will be held with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will discuss a book on how to operate the area for all of Ireland for food and food.
A dog with no nose and legs subjugates Instagram.
Perfectly imperfect
Kundelek was supposed to be asleep.
However, this has been prevented.
The bitch was transferred from Romania to the United Kingdom by Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
A photo of the sand was published on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love with the animal since first sight.
"I had difficulty at first believing my husband to adopt because we had three dogs already," she said.
The woman decided that she would take care of herself until she was taken by someone else.
But no one's reported yet.
"The fact that no one wanted her made me want to take care of her more and more.
She was sensitive and needed love," Kate said.
At the end of the marriage, Bonnie decided to adopt.
"Our Bonnie is perfectly imperfect.
We love her as she is, and if anyone doesn't like what she looks like, it's his problem, not ours," said the woman.
Bonnie became a social media star over time.
In Instagram, over 14,000 internet sites are being watched.
Lorraine Kelly: I'm told I'm never going to make a career on TV with a music accent
According to Lorraine Kelly, TV bosses said that because of the accent from Glasgow, "he will never make a career" as a presenter.
Referring to her 35-year-old career in Kelly's television industry, in 59, she admitted that before her first performance on the screen, she felt "very nervous".
"I was only 25 years old and I was very nervous," she said.
When I was working in BBC Scotland as a research and information expert, the chief said that through my accent from Glasgow, I would never be successful on television.
I went to London to get to know the entire TV team and watch the show before I took on office duties in Glasgow.
I'll never forget the interview with the star Bette Davis conducted by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a live legend.
I knew I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly became a shock TV correspondent in 1984, she began her career as a local reporter in East Kibride in Scotland.
She then started to run programs such as GMTV, ITV Breakfast and Daybreak, to later start her early "Lorraine" program, which she named after.
The 35th anniversary of her career is a special program that will bring to mind her best memories of moments and interviews.
The representative said that the secret to her long internship on television is "passage and enthusiasm" and "interest", adding, "It is difficult to work.
To be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programs and be both interesting and interesting.
When she mentioned the media reports that had disturbed her emotions, Kelly said that "very difficult" for her was the relationship of a murder in Dunblane.
I had no idea that many families killed or injured children were watching our program live from Dunblane the day after the terrible murder of sixteen children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose five-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me to have a private meeting, during which we talked for many hours at her house.
The whole meeting was quiet, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral, where I took part.
She added that "very difficult" was an interview with Kate and Gerry McCannami shortly after their daughter Madeleine disappeared in 2007 and that "their strength and courage were truly exhilarating".
They have to deal with the pain because they don't know what happened to their beloved daughter, and in addition, they have the most terrible comments online trolls.
I'm with them with all my heart.
The programme for the 35th anniversary of Lorraine Kelly's work on TV will start at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30th at the ITV station.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga was afraid of imprisonment
At the highest level, the state official claimed that Vice-President Constantine Chiweng rejected the invitation to take over the president's office, made by a non-living President Robert Mugabe, at the summit turning point, because he was afraid of being imprisoned in order to confirm the take over of the military in November 2017.
As was the case last week, The Zimbabwe Independent, Mugabe offered the Vice-President of Chiwänze the presidency during negotiations with the military in turn.
However, a higher level of government officials announced in the community media that Chiwenga did not reject the proposals for fear, but because he reviewed the Mugabe plan, which aims to prove to the world leaders and the African Union (AU) that it actually lost during the conversion.
In the tweet, which confirmed that a 37-year-old Zimbabwean ruler wanted to hand over the government to the Vice-President of Chiwanza, not President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Jamwanda 2, to which officials confirmed to the state that he was a senior official at the Bureau of Presidents and the Council of Ministers, it was claimed that there had been intensive negotiations on the matter at that time.
The state officials claimed that Mugabe contacted Chiweng through one of his envoys when he realized that the authorities had withdrawn his hand.
The mediation between the military authorities and the former president had, in the view of a higher rank of state official, three stages.
The official claimed that among the participants in the negotiations, he was the spokesman for President George Charamba, then acting as head of the Central Intelligence Organization Aaron Nheper and the spiritual representative of the Roman Catholic Bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
They were bank chief Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, another element since Mugabe sent him with a one-person mission to hand over the offer of the Presidency of Chiwanze, who was the head of the Zimbabwe Defence Force (SOS).
A man who was considered to be more than an African icon after death tried empty-handedly to get military action from the U.S., trying to lure other African leaders into intervention.
The President's offer, made by Mugabe to the former Chief of Defence Forces (SSO) Chiwänze, was not elected.
"It was a desperate act to save the situation, which took a dangerously fast pace, removing part of the deceased's family," the official wrote (Jamwanda).
But there was also some political temptation, which led to the death attempt to reverse the situation in a completely non-deploymental way.
It is enough to remind ourselves that the commanders have declared that they did not cover and will not cover constitutional order, which would be the cause of their conflict with the U.S. position on revolutions.
The dead (Mugaba) hoped that then the SSO (Chivenga) would be forced to force, violently interrupting the leaders' claims that they did not interfere with the constitutional order.
The hope for the dead (Mugabe) was that the UA, which, on the margin, was still highly disoriented by the whole situation and how it would fit into its theoretical taxonomy of conversion, would then have no choice but to describe it as a conversion, thus calling for military intervention would be credible.
It was in such a spirit and with such calculation that the offer was made.
Officials claimed that Mugabe made this move when he realized that the defence forces were no longer ready to protect him.
They said that Mugabe was forced to sign a resignation letter after the power warning that he was risking a Kaddafi-style lynx.
The military commanders have informed him that they will not shoot citizens if they move on to his Blue Roof residence.
And at the same time, Mugabe had two wishes to save his family and prove that the army had taken over the government," the officer added.
The current SSO and the commanders have read the statements correctly.
To the consignor (Gono) who conveys this desperate message to understand, through a strong metaphor, that the tiri wemakwapa-makwapa (which belongs to the camouflage sect, i.e. the army), we are neither politicians nor competing with ourselves at political level, claimed a higher rank of state official.
State officials say that the military has informed military commanders in the region through attacks in Zimbabwe that they do not intend to cover Mugabe but deal with the "criminalists".
Mugabe has tried to use the same strategy to revitalize Mnangagwa from a short exile in South Africa so that they can talk about conversion and success.
In addition to negotiations with the army, Mugabe also sought assistance in the region.
The inhabitants of the South African Republic, which is a key element of the process – not only because of their economic and regional power, but also because then President Jacob Zuma was President of Sadc – refused the intervention, but clearly indicated that if the army finds the Mugabe house, as it has been feared many times in the background, the forces of the South African Republic will immediately appear in Harare.
"It didn't work because Putin and African leaders didn't choose this route," said the Independent.
China needs a strong leadership or it's going to fall apart as the policy paper states.
China needs a strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party, because otherwise the country will be "decommissioned" – the government stated in a document on the policy issued on Friday in the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic.
The Chinese government's Press Office reported in the White Paper that the country's success since the Communists took over 70 years ago led the party.
The Chinese occupy a large area, they have complex national conditions, but the administrative difficulties are rarely seen here.
The document mentions that without the single and strong Chinese leadership, they will move towards divisions and divisions, which will be disastrous for the world.
The Chinese authorities have long used a hard-hand policy to solve the problems, as in the case of a wave of pro-democratic protests in Beijing in 1989, and that is why it is necessary to maintain the stability of the country.
President Xi Jinping, who has been holding a strong hand, who will be in charge of the second-year trade in the world economy on Tuesday, since the adoption of the office by the end of 2012, has further strengthened the party's governments and imposed sanctions on those who can question the government.
Xi is also overseeing the military modernisation programme, which has run out of balance in this region.
The document states that China does not attempt to export its development model or want to import any foreign models, seeking only peace, not "hegemony".
The Chinese have no control over other nations or over the world.
In modern times China has been oppressed by great powers, and war and anxiety have left deep impression on them because of the suffering they have suffered; China will never inflict any other suffering they have experienced.
China covers this year in uncertain times for the country involved in a bitter trade war with the United States and facing the challenges of the economy as well as anti-government protests in China under Hong Kong.
The document says that China never "trades" its most important interests, nor will it allow for any damage to their sovereignty.
As regards the country's trade dispute with Washington, the document stated that "the threat of trade wars and the further increase in customs tariffs do not solve problems".
China is a mature economy with a complete industrial system, a complete industry chain, a wide market place and a strong pace of economic development.
The document added that "war trades will never weaken it".
The Chinese are certain that they are able to face difficulties, the crisis to turn into a new opportunity and open up a new world.
It was also added that the United States should look at China's development rationally, because the Chinese do not intend to question the position of the United States, nor do they want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, but it is less likely that they will stop the development of China.
The limitation and weakening of other countries and the transfer of national disputes abroad will not provide the United States with a strong position.
World Jack Pålkiewicz: Dubai, real faces
Dubai's emirat is a place still searching for its own identity, scattered between the Bedouin tradition, religious radicalism of Islam and extremism of progress.
This new trend in world tourism leads to the awakening of imagination and aspirations, leading to the emptyness of rich snobbish hotels and attracting searching for fortunes for investors and traders as a tax haven.
Websites are enthusiastic about this city of dreams, which is an exciting temple of luxury and a concentrated 20th-century architecture concentration.
They arose in the rich desert of the desert emirath became Eden for those who love the remains, five star hotels, beautiful weather and pools hundreds of meters above the earth.
It is a great delight to see all around us, appreciate the creative hyperactivity and the hysterical quest for avant-garde.
This is the city whose motto says everything: "shock, shake and shake".
And it's almost every step.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling it a city of no character.
According to British writer Lawrence Osborne, “the full range and cross-referencing of the metropolis has taken the size of the tandem grotesque. ”
It turned into a futuristic nightmare, totally dominated by the Guinness Book of Records, an unofficial constitution of emirate.
Because everything here must be bigger and more beautiful than anywhere else in the world.
There is, however, a lack of something in the old Europe that is perhaps a little transparent, but important for the quality of life.
In Wroclaw, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels at home.
And in Dubai, I'm sure not.
Running away from the magic world, I broke his golden mask, revealing the other faces of the artificial paradise.
It's a bill that doesn't speak of and doesn't write.
I'm showing the Asian nest contrasting with the basic living conditions of the divine caste of the Dubain ethnics, the unwritten Bedouin grandsons.
I go to a place of extreme poverty, such as the ghetto on the outskirts of the city, where under cruel conditions the army of Asian workers is being built.
That's what they built in one generation under slave conditions to the desert Manhattan sky.
They came here with good wages and a chance to ensure a decent life for their families and a nightmare.
This tourist will never see it because it could blow up in the air created by the years-in-the-mill of Dubai.
The growing criticism of the international community makes the issue of cheap labour very difficult for the emir.
Mel C of the Spice Girls team has forbidden in her home a discussion of diets after her eating disorders
Melanie Chisholm, from the Spice Girls group, admitted that there was a ban on the use of diets in her home after she had struggled with eating disorders, eating only fruit and vegetables for years.
Sports Spice for years did not eat and "obsessively practiced" as a result of the pressure associated with being a famous member of the pop group all over the world, resulting in later depression and eating disorders.
It is now revealing that her experiences affect how she is raising her daughter Scarlet, so she “does not allow her home to talk about diets. ”
"Scarlet is now 10 years old and I begin to see that he is more aware of his appearance," Mel said.
“I think that one of the things that has been experienced by eating disorders is that I am very aware of how I speak to her.
The use of a positive language has now become my habit.
In an interview for the magazine Women's Health Mel, which was celebrated in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls team, she said that in times prior to the creation of social media, the “disturbing” press commented on her topic had created complexities.
"I began to look at myself in an inappropriate way, abandoning a group of food products, practicing increasingly obsessive until I began to have a disability," he says.
"I was sick and it probably lasted a few years."
A picture that shook the world
The Polish girl and American documentaryist gave the world a witness about the atrocities of war.
Legendal picture by Julien Bryan can be viewed at the World War II Museum in Gdańsk
"Listen to my story.
I'm talking from the troubled city of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish people about what happened here.
America must act, must help!", began his radio presentation documentaryist, photographer, Julien Bryan.
In September 1939 he was in the capital of Poland, seeing the drama of the bombed city and its inhabitants.
His relationship took place in the West with a broad range.
The president of Warsaw, Stefan Sterzyński, helped him first, borrowed the car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a letter of congratulation to his family in the United States, deposited it in the embassy safe and... stayed.
For the next four weeks, he tried to be anywhere where the warts were.
400 planes and artillery almost stopped attacking the city.
Bryan spent his life in pictures of death, suffering, the struggle to survive in the tears of the city.
Just before the capitalization, he and the embassies were negative for the ocean.
He wasn't talking about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: “What Warsaw met, Paris, London, and even New York.”
His shocking chronicle was watched by President Eleanor Roosevelt.
Soon the United States began preparing for war.
“Dad showed the truth and thus fought German propaganda.
They were making films glorifying their wealth.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, son of Julien.
The report before the jury against the former sportsman accused of numerous rapes
In front of the jury, there is a process of violence committed to the former baseball team of the University of Delaware, who is accused of numerous sexual assaults.
On Friday after 10 days of giving the testimony and hearing the arguments, the jury members agreed to the 23-year-old Clay Conaway.
A woman who was 21 years old claims that Conaway raped her when she went to his home in June 2018.
The event took place three weeks after the two met on the Bumble page and sending a woman through the man of the photograph on which he presented himself naked.
A woman is one of six Conaway accused of sexual assault in the years 2013-2018.
According to the prosecutor, the woman’s consent to the plea turned into a rape that met her opposition.
The defenders refer to the opposite relationship between women and the harbors in memory and claim that the woman probably regretted that it had come to an intimate close.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bike for a million gold
A gold bike worth a million gold could be viewed on the anniversary, the 10th edition of the International BiKE-EXPO Rive Markets.
This is an extraordinary vehicle printed on a 3D printer.
His constructor, 30-year-old Adam Zdanowic, just got Oskar's bike for him at the World's Custom River Show in Las Vegas.
A rare copy made a hole in the market.
It's an unusual coating made by my colleague from Zor.
"If you're a saddle, they're pedals, they're a driver, you could normally drive it.
It can expand the speed of 50 kilometers per hour.
It's an electric bike," says his designer.
‘The bike car was printed on a 3D printer.
It's six types of virus.
I came up with the idea of this model riding on my first bike home a few years ago.
I drew it on the card and hid it deep into the drawer.
The sketch was waiting five years for the realization.
Sam's bike has been built for three years," Adam Zdanowicz adds.
“It was extremely difficult to hide all elements under the body.
There are batteries, wires, building elements inside.
This is hidden under the body of 11 elements on the steel frame of the bike.
There's a motor hidden there, too.
The driver to this bike was set up a week before my trip to the United States at the World Rover Show.
I couldn't decide what kind of driver this is.
She's a transporter.
The Rover weighs 90 kilograms," he sums up.
The gold-covered bike was rated in Las Vegas as the most important competition category "Best amazing single custom copy".
Film material shows strong pollution of popular tourist sites
The Sydney Bay surrounded by the Opera Building, the Circular Quay Port, the Luna Park entertainment park and, of course, the famous Harbour Bridge bridge make a substantial contribution to the amount of $21.9 billion, annually funded by the Australian economy by tourists visiting Sydney.
But under the bridge, the ugly truth is hidden.
The well-known Sydney Bay is one of the most damaged waterways in the country, to which the volume of pollution affects the volume of about 15 Olympic pools each year.
These frightening statistics make one of our biggest tourist attractions at the same time one of our most filthy waters.
According to the new film material entitled “Sydney Bay – up and down”, the waters around Australia’s most popular city are full of waste, plastic nets and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothing, and even dead animals, all of which flow into the bay along with rain showers.
However, the majority of the composition that breathes our shipping channels is plastic.
"I would call it paradox," says Dr. Katherine Dafforn, deputy director of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, in which the publication of this film is deliberately taking place during World Tourism Day.
This water looks beautiful, but it's one of the most altered and damaged to cross the river along our coast.
The CSIRO Agency estimates that every hour about 1560 kg of plastic is passing into our waterways, and most of it is affected by the sinks through the rapid sewer.
"After such powerful falls of the bay... it seems rather tragic," said Dr. Dafforn.
Two thirds of the pollutants come from rainwater.
However, as with the top of the ice problem with Sydney Bay, it is much more serious under the water surface, as 70% of the plastic coming into the ocean hits the bottom of the sea.
“In my opinion, as long as there is no time under the water, it is not really possible to realize what is in the deep there,” said Richard Nichols, owner of the Dive Centre Manly, paying attention to the fact that he and his team automatically extract about 500 kg of plastic from the water each year.
I think if more people knew (what's in the water), they'd just be scared.
It's impressive... over half what we find at the bottom are plastic nets.
The other 50% are the things that are at least made of plastic.
When you look at the curtain, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all this plastic and the rest of the trash we're making is under the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and director of Ocean Protect, said that there are ways in which people – both local and tourist alike – could help reduce the amount of plastics and the rest of our waterways.
"It must start at the source," he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic used by us, better conduct material recovery and have a greater awareness of what we're putting into the liquids that eventually hit the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we're starving because 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean.
It absorbs 30% of the carbon dioxide and our food source.
However, we can arrange this trap and restore it to its former glory, which is very simple.
If we die our oceans, we'll kill ourselves too.
The film material financed by the TOMRA recycling company as part of its broader efforts to educate Australians in the field of environmental protection and reduce the negative impact of containers on beverages that are often affected by the environment will be carried out in the course of a study on the interdependence between artificial and mental health products published this month.
The new survey conducted among 546 children 12 to 18 years of age found that 82% of respondents feel uneasy about plastic waste and 25% of the adults' wines for the problem of plastic packaging waste.
The study revealed that plastic waste was also a fourth of the concerns of parents, while 93% of the 551 surveyed parents said that their concerns about the amount of plastic waste coming into the oceans were growing.
Many people who took part in the study said that they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they just don't know how to make significant changes that led to environmental fear.
Poland – Slovenia.
Mems after the match of nets in the semi-final ME
It wasn't an easy match.
The Slovenians had a vital public on their side, which effectively deconcentrated Polish netizens.
A lot of controversy has also been raised by judges who, in one of their actions, have not decided to take four steps on the economic side.
It happened at the key moment of the first set, when it was the soulguard Vital Heynen had the chance to jump off the rivals and win the first match.
However, this did not happen, and the Polish finally had to recognize the height of the race, which after winning 3:1 in the final tournament.
Ghana: Traders from Kaneshie Support Psychiatric Hospital in Accra
The members of the Kaneshie Market Associations gave 30 000 GH of food yesterday to the Psychiatric Hospital in Accra during a short ceremony that took place in Accra.
This is an element of trade in the 40th anniversary of the Kaneshie Market Complex.
Among other things, there were various food items, fruit, non-alcoholic beverages, teasing, clothing, spices, bananas, manioc and waterworks.
During the visit, the group also talked to several patients on the site.
The event was attended by members of the Accra Markets Limited Board, the Directors of Association and the Queen's Mothers.
In presenting the items, Mrs. Mercy Naa Afrowa Needjan, president of the Women's Association of the Great Acre Region, announced that the donation is an element of the regular activity of the welfare group within the framework of social responsibility.
She noticed that support for care for patients in the hospital was needed to show them love and allow them to feel part of society.
Ms. Needjan promised hospital support from the association and invited other associations to follow up on this gesture.
Taking gifts, Dr Pinnaman Appau, the director of the hospital, praised the association for its support and promised that it would be well used for the benefit of patients.
She called other hospital support organizations.
Google creates a cloud in Poland.
PKO BP partner
The Regional Cloud Operator, PKO BP and PFR, has launched a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation is designed to help Polish companies implement and exploit the potential of computing cloud technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offer of the Operator of the Land Cloud, and Google will open in Warsaw called the Google Cloud region – i.e. the hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the region of Central and Eastern Europe.
The Google Cloud region will be the first global, public computing cloud installation in Central Europe.
The numbering of Polish companies was one of the key assumptions underlying the project of the creation of the National Cloud, initiated and developed by PKO Bank Poland and by the Polish Development Fund, the participants of the company.
The Country Cloud Partnership and Google are another important step on the road we took a year ago, announcing the call of the State Cloud Operator.
The objective remains unchanged – the digitisation of the Polish economy and the dynamism of its growth.
"Now Polish companies get additional, refined tools for its implementation.
By taking advantage of them, they increase their chances for progress in the world league, which we all care about.
The fact that Google joins them today greatly strengthens our joint project," says Zbigniew Jagieło, President of the PKO Bank of Poland.
The Polish Development Fund notes that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and businesses.
“Investment in the National Cloud Operator is ideally incorporated into the PFR strategy as an important element of the country’s digitisation.
It provides modern and affordable business solutions based on cloud architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and attract the best specialists to it," adds Paweł Boris, President of the PFR.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on leading technical infrastructure, providing computing power and data storage services.
Customers in Poland in the service portfolio will find all key Google Cloud Platform products such as Computer Engine, App Engine, Google Cubenets Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner, or BigQuery.
The inclusion of Google Cloud services in the offer of the National Cloud will enable Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies that they use for global competition.
We will, however, remain in Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators," says Michał Potoczek, president of the National Cloud Operator.
It adds that the company will be ready for mega-ranges, such as Internet things (IoT), which increase the need for the calculation power necessary to process huge data collections.
VI General Polish Seniors' Parade
On the same afternoon, 24 August 2019, at Ronde de Gaulle in Warsaw, the VI Seniors' Parade "Growded Splendid" and the Poknik Pokolní, events organized by the Foundation of Homes.
“ The Council is an event on a global scale, ” said Wisnijewski of the Foundation.
She's been through the centre of Warsaw for the sixth time to identify how large and diverse communities are seniors.
Through the Paradise, we oppose harmful stereotypes affecting older people and call for intergenerational solidarity."
The parade was conducted by a special five-car bus serving as a mobile music scene, on which the famous Warsaw DJ Wika has traditionally performed.
The participants in the happy choir, at the second known Warsaw and World War II, passed by the Alejas Jerusalem, the island of Kruczen to the Place of Resurrection Warsaw, the island of Mazowička to the Place of J. Pilsudski and the island of Králewski.
During the march, where several thousand seniors, representing 300 senior organisations from all over Poland, participated, the colorful delegations were welcomed by numerous groups on the march, Warsaw and tourists.
From Legionau in the parade took part in two organized groups in corporate yellow and blue shirts.
The first representative of the University of the Third Century and the Senior Club+ and the second under the name SAGA, the Senior Active Animators Group.
At the campus of the university organizers prepared gastronomic and numerous stops of institutions and companies offering seniors services and products to improve their daily life and functioning.
There are medical, cosmetic, culinary, recreational, sports and fashion stands.
For example, at the Stylish Seniors of the Seniors' Voice from professional Hanny Piekarski and designer Agnieszki Vrwał, you could get tips and information about current trends in fashion 60+.
Stoisko also offered the workshop of the science of moving around the scene and taking pictures.
It was an occasion to show the style of the Seniors.
The most recent edition of letters and materials on the campaign "Stop manipulation – Don't buy at the presentation!" was found at the Stasi of the General Polish Voice.
Other stands offered cosmetic, moving, plastic and artistic workshops.
A few studies and consultations with health and nutrition experts could be made.
Discussion panels were also organized with the participation of Helen Norowicz, Beaty Tadli, Marioli Bojarskiej-Ferenc, Tomasz Jacikova or Robert Janovski.
There were no vocal and musical attractions on the picnic.
A Polish song, Krzysztof Krawczyk, was featured on the stadium, and the evening was an intergenerational dance that led DJ Wika.
Tasmanian devils can provide guidance on cancer treatment
Tasmanian devils may have the key to cancer treatment – researchers have completed a breakthrough detection that can revolutionize therapy for patients
Researchers in the field of medicine have discovered how to mask some cancer cells
Researchers have found that the same process takes place in the Tasmanian devils and in people
There is hope that this discovery will bring new methods of treatment for oncological patients
What do the Tusmans and the people have in common?
New cells that can become invisible.
Researchers, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have completed a breakthrough discovery that can help revolutionize the treatment of some tumors if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also include a key to the treatment of mortal tumors within the face, threatening the future of the endangered Tasmanian devil.
The study established a way of masking certain tumour cells in both humans and in bags, using a group of proteins called PCC2, which excludes a marker that would otherwise signal resistance to the tumour attack.
This may be the biggest challenge in the treatment of small cell lung cancer, neuroblastomas and the type of skin cancer called cancer from Merl's cells.
"The great importance of this project is that in patients who occasionally develop resistance to immunological therapy, we can be able to reverse this process," said AAP chief researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapy may be directed to re-injecting markers, proteins called MHC, which will allow the immune system to recognise the tumour cells.
"This potentially has a long-term implications for people with lung cancer," said Professor Dawson.
“It is one of the most common diseases on earth.
And maybe we'll be able to treat her much better.
Researchers also hope that the discovery will sometimes be used to treat the tumors of the Tasmanian devil's face, where the tumour cells similarly avoid detection.
"It is extraordinary that exactly the same process occurs (in the case of human revolutions and the Tasmanian devils)," said Professor Dawson.
“As it has been, it has been very difficult to treat the lives of the Tasmanian devils.
But if medicine that works in humans can also be used in the Tasmanian devils, there is a possibility that it will help control the disease."
Scientists will be surprised by the fact that around a really small star circles a very large planet
Scientists marvel at the discovery of a solar system 30 years of light from the Earth, which subjugates our current understanding of the processes of the creation of the planets, because in this system, a large planet similar to Jowis surrounds a small star called the red karma.
Artistic illustration of the GJ 3512b orbiting the central star of the red karma, published on 26 September 2019.
In general, stars are much larger than even the largest planets surrounding them.
However, as scientists said Thursday, in this case the stars and the planet are slightly different in size.
The size of the star called GJ 3512 is about 12% of the sun's size, while the mass of the planet that surrounds it is at least half the mass of Jowis, the largest planet of our solar system.
"Yes, it's an absolute surprise," said Astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Catalan Institute of Space Research at the Spanish Institute of Space Research, which was the focus of research published in Science magazine.
The discovery is amazing because the theoretical models of solar systems suggest that low mass stars usually become maternal stars for smaller planets similar to Earth or smaller Neptunes.
"In this case, we discovered a planet of a type of ultraviolet gas similar to Jovis surrounding a very small star," said Morales.
The planet that, like Jovisz, consists mainly of gas discovered using a telescope in the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It surrounds its star after a very elliptical orbit, and the full circle lasts 204 days.
Red males are small and have relatively low surface temperature.
The GJ 3512 star is not only much smaller than the Sun, but to some extent it has a size comparable to the size of a very large planet, as it is only about 35% larger than Jowis.
They emit less energy, so they are lighter than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is about 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"That's why they have red colors," said Morales.
"There is evidence of the existence of a second planet that currently surrounds this star, while a third planet could be expelled from a previous star system, which can interpret an elliptical orbit of a planet similar to Jowis," said Morales.
The planets are made up of the same interstellar disk of gas and dust that produces a star surrounding the planets.
According to the leading model of the creation of planets called the model of acretion, the object is initially formed from particles that are fixed on the disk, and the gravitational force of the planet in the early stage of development allows for the creation of an atmosphere of surrounding gas.
This non-typical arrangement can explain a competitive model called gravity instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around a young star may be a little more massive than we expect and may be cold," said Morales.
This leads to a problem with the stability of the disc, so some more dense areas may appear.
These masses can grow until they fall and create a planet.
Delicate worker accused of co-administration of a fasole dip containing methamphetamine
The Sheriff's office in Marion County stopped Cassandra Medinium-Hernandez, 38 years old, for the administration of a post-fassol dip worker containing methamphetamine.
On Thursday from Albania, 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez was charged with the delivery of methamphetamine and the consumption of that substance controlled by another person – both crimes are crimes of a second degree.
The complaint was dismissed on the basis of a 9 September event in the Thriftway food store in Jefferson.
In the statement made by the OregonLive.com portal, which indicates the likelihood of guilt, the 27-year-old suspect's collaborator told the deputy mayor of Marion that during lunch break, she saw Medina-Hernandez do a dip of beans, which she then shared.
On the basis of the statement, it is known that the victim of the crime, who, according to what she reported, never took the methmphetamines, said that "she thought that one of the pieces she ate tasted strangely, but did not raise any suspicions about it".
When she returned to work, she felt that she had a stomach spread and that she could not stand on her feet.
According to the newspaper Albany Democrat-Herald, she went to a local hospital where it was found that a dip of beans could contain methamphetamine.
Based on reports from The Smoking Gun, another police officer said that Medina-Hernandez " told her that she was adding drugs to food", while another admitted that the suspect had sent her message, claiming that methamphetamine had hit the Fassol dip by accident.
The OregonLive widower reports on the recording from the delicacy monitoring, which is said to show how the back of the Medina-Hernandez camera pulls something out of the biston, stands behind the microphone and turns away.
Then she relaxes, she wipes her nose, comes to the table and has a dip of beans in a small paper machine.
According to the police, the thing that she pulled out of the bistonic also probably was on the plate.
The Oregon newspaper Statesman-Journal reports that the officers of the sheriff's office claim that there is no doubt at present that the customers will be given food damage.
Medina-Hernandez is in Marion County prison – the guaranteed bail is $520 000.
According to The Smoking Gun, her extensive police record indicates that the woman was already convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, the delivery of methamphetamine, theft, possession of methamphetamine and possession of illegal weapons.
Johnson gives a shot in the confusion of rejection
Boris Johnson's trip to the United Nations General Assembly was unethically interrupted by the historical decision of the Supreme Court.
However, his coercive appearance in the Gmin Chamber did not betray either shame or conscience.
To explain the meaning of this transformation, Tony Connelly, editor of the European RTD Section in Brussels and London correspondent Sean Whelan in Westminster, is in the eye of the cyclone.

What does KAS do about Chief NIK?
The rental of property at below the market price is reservations that arise in connection with the case of the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banasi.
What the treasure is doing in this case, we asked the Treasury Administration Chamber in Krakow and the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel, in his report for "Supervision" TVN, expressed doubts about the statements of the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banasi.
For a few months, the study has been the Central Anti-Corruption Office.
Control is due to end in the second half of October, after parliamentary elections.
According to the statements, Banas was to rent a stone with an area of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
In total, he received 65.7 thousand gold each year.
The Supervision Report revealed that the hotel was located in the stone rented by him for an hour.
Chief NIK later explained on state television why he only picked up over 5,000 gold a month for the rent of property.
“Voice magazine”, referring to experts from the valuation of real estate, she estimated that it should be 15 thousand gold a month behind the stone itself.
"The amount was lower for a simple reason: I entered into a preliminary contract and that the tenant was supposed to buy this stone, led me to agree on a lower order that the remaining items would be settled at the sale of the stone," Banas convinced.
However, doubts arose as to whether such a procedure did not constitute a violation of the law.
Konrad Zawada, a press spokesman for the Treasury Office in Krakow, informed the TVN24 that "the case is directly dealt with by the Ministry of Finance".
"All such questions please address the Minister of Finance," he added.
Zawada explained that in such cases "the State Administration is responsible for the operation of the Treasury".
The press spokesman of the Ministry of Finance, Paweł Jurek, admitted that the Treasury Administration itself monitors many matters that may arise in reservations.
"The Royal Treasury Office operates in such a way that it has its own information, as it is based in a sense on those information which is publicly available.
On this basis, it decides whether or not to conduct any proceedings on a specific matter," the MF spokesman explained.
"But because we all have a treasure secret in the entire financial resource, we never speak, because we cannot speak in individual cases of a particular taxpayer, a particular person, or a particular company," said Marian Banasia.
The Minister of Finance Jerzy Kwiecinski stressed that "the treasury authorities do not communicate this type of message to the public."
"It is known that the whole treasure machine deals with very similar cases throughout the country," he pointed out.
Secrets of the royal family: amazing visitors often flying the royal plane
As part of the service obligations, the royal family must travel hundreds of times around the world.
This usually facilitates royal aircraft – a private machine that drives the royal family around the world to important events and events.
It's not surprising that having your own plane is linked to privileges.
Members of the royal family do not have to stand in long queues to repair, they do not have their limits on the number of luggage, and, as it turns out, they may be invited on board any guest – including truly unaccompanied.
According to the recent premiere on Channel 5 of the documentary film not only the Queen and Prince Philip often travel by royal plane.
During the program entitled “King’s Secrets of Flights,” the Royal Flyer’s Navigator revealed that with the royal family, guests often flew away.
Bob Shields said: "Sometimes with our very important royal guests could fly very important royal dogs."
It is not surprising that the queen could have wished that her beloved lovers would accompany her on her journey, since she is known for her deep attachment to the race of the choir.
Since the youngest years, Queen Elizabeth has been a lover of these four-dimensional creatures and has been listening to the fact that since the time of the crown, she has been the owner of more than 30 baskets.
It is said that in 2007 she had five baskets: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow and Holly.
It was added to them five cocker spanishes: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Spain, as well as four dogs that are crossword puzzles: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The royal aircraft crew must have had full hands.
An employee of the royal house running the dogs was seen asking them to meet their needs before they were taken on board the plane,” says Shields.
It's nice to tell you, there's never been an incident.
The programme also revealed a shocking number of luggage that the queen carries with her on board during her travel in the performance of her duties.
The film's Narrator stated: “In 1953 the queen took 12 tons of luggage in her trip of 70,000 kilometers. ”
To be able to see it better, it's less than two huge elephants.
However, the queen is not the only one who has a weakness for fashion.
Similarly, Princess Cambridge also has her own conveniences regarding the carriage of her wardrobe – it is said that for each of her dresses there is a private seat.
The new law enters into force.
In case of injury, the employee will receive a pension
On Friday, a regulation will enter into force providing for the payment of further interest in cases of serious damage – the Financial Ombudsman informs.
The Act of 9 July 2019 on the special rights of persons injured in the event of the exhaustion of the guarantee determined on the basis of the provisions in force before 1 January 2006.
It concerns persons who were injured before 1 January 2006.
They were then definitely lower than the current guarantee amount, and in some cases insurers have already stopped paying the rent.
"I am pleased with this regulation because our institution has been running a mechanism for many years to ensure that, in cases of serious damage, financial support is guaranteed from the insurance of the Communications OC or the farmer's OC despite the exhaustion of the guarantee amount," says Alexander Daszewski, Legal Counsel at the Office of the Financial Officer.
In the view of the Financial Charter, this was necessary because it is often a very tragic situation for people in very poor health who, due to the accident, cannot work, for example, and at the same time bear significant costs of accidental rehabilitation treatment.
Some of them have no longer received compensatory payments and for increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the so-called guarantee sum of OC policies.
Some have threatened it in the next few years.
By 1 January 2006, the liability of the insurer was significantly lower than the present level.
Therefore, the problem of exhausting the guarantee amount in previous years was most often affected by people who suffered damage in the 1990s.
At the time, the guarantee amounts were very low and the economic conditions led to a significant increase in prices.
"We have also noted that this problem has also affected a number of mostly young people who have suffered damage during the period when the amount was 350 thousand euros for each injured case.
Currently, this is EUR 5.21 million for the event, regardless of the number of injured.
This is therefore a huge difference in relation to the earlier periods, from which the problem required the intervention of the legislator," recalls Alexander Daszewski.
In view of the fact that the guarantee amount has been increased for some time, the legislator has agreed that the upper limit of liability of the Guarantee Fund will be the guarantee amount in force at the time of sending the claim to the Fund for the payment of the rent.
This principle applies if the insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay the rent on the basis of a judgment establishing the amount of the guarantee other than that laid down in the OC Insurance Agreement.
This is the case where the guarantee amount is increased on a court basis on the basis of Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which allows for the modification of the existing binding relationship.
"In the last days we have sent letters to people who have been asking for intervention in the past.
We inform them of new powers and of course ensure that further support can be given in the event of any problems,” says Alexander Daszewski.

Brenda Barattini convicted of cutting off the boy's penis
The case concerns events from November 2017.
According to Buenos Aires Times, then Brenda Barattini found out that her boyfriend showed a familiar sextatism that arose in their bedroom.
The 28-year-old, who is an architect, explained to the court that the partner thus ruined her life and treated her as a "tropheus", which can be praised in the presence of friends.
"He violated my intimacy, my life and my career.
He destroyed everything," she argued.
The Cordoba resident himself decided to measure justice.
She invited her boyfriend, 42-year-old Sergio F. to bed and told him she was preparing a special surprise.
By means of an axamitite, she blindfolded his eyes, and then she caught him and cut off his penis.
"I felt like I was going to die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, I pulled down, and I grabbed a cell phone to get ready," he confessed.
“I wanted to leave, but she started hurting me.
She caught me for a shirt and hair, not letting me go," he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend had hurt her by revealing sextatism, she did not try to escape responsibility.
"Please measure justice," she said in the direction of the jury.
She was finally convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
Former state congressman Alabama Jack Edwards died at the age of 91
On Friday, the retired Alabama State Congressman of the Republican Party, Jack Edwards, died, who served for 10 years and belonged to the first wave of Republicans from the so-called Deep South.
Family spokesman said that Edwards died in his home in Fairhope after fighting a new pancake.
Edwards was originally elected to the American Congress in 1965 as one of the first Republicans of Alabama in the Deep South because of the party's winning supporters here.
At the Congress, he served 10 responsibilities.
According to a statement by the family in response to a recent question about what the world would want to leave to its lawyers and lawyers, Edwards replied that he would want to return kindness.
"I hope that my lawyers and my lawyers will grow up in a country where a common debate and efforts to solve the country's problems will return grace," said Edwards, according to the family statement.
The Governor of Alabama Kay Ivey said that Edwards served his position as well as the country with the highest standards of honesty.
She added that on his part, a flag on Alabama State Capitol would be left to half the mast.
"He was a true state official and was the best man of state for Alabama.
Our state has lost one of the most important policies," Ivey said in a statement.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle "inspiration" on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed high respect for Meghan Markle at Instagram on Thursday, calling Princess Sussex "a caring leader who breaks the schemes and makes our world better."
Prince Harry and Prince Harry, currently traveling ten-day the Queen's trip to South Africa with their son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, took part in a youth meeting at the beginning of this week, during which they met with the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
"I would like to thank my friend, Her Royal City, Princess Sussex @sussexroyal, "a caring leader who breaks the schemes and makes our world better," wrote the first lady in her enthusiastic post.
"Is this meeting with the leaders of the Obama Foundation @ObamaFoundation, or helping girls around the world to gain access to the education they deserve is inspiration for many people," Obama added, adding a picture showing a smiling Meghan looking at the foundation leaders.
Meghan conducted an interview with Obama for the September edition of the British Vogue, hosted by the former film actor "Suits".
In a sincere conversation, the first lady spoke about motherhood and how it changed.
"Being a mother means bringing the art of forgiveness to the championship," Obama said in the interview.
“Maternity taught me that for most of my time it is my job to give children space so that they can get to know the world and become whom they want to be.
Not the one I want to be, or the one I wanted to be, in their age, but the one in their heart.
Obama, who knows from experience what the pressure of being on the church is, divided himself with the priestly council during the interview with Good Housekeeping magazine.
"The pressure you feel – thrown by yourself and others – can sometimes push you" she said.
"My advice is therefore to relax and not hurry at all.
For the first few months in the White House, I spent most of my time worrying about my daughter, making sure that they did well at school and brought new acquaintances before I devoted myself to more ambitious work.
I think it's necessary, too.
Hotel Trump maintains a permit for the sale of alcohol despite complaints for the owner's training
WASHINGTON (AP) – The alcoholic beverages control Commission in Washington has withdrawn the request to verify whether the local Trump International Hotel should lose its authorisation to sell alcohol because of the owner’s equipment.
The Agency has held that the complaint of three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbines is unfounded because most of them do not live in the district or have no property in it.
"The Washington Post" says that the second time you have an interest in withdrawing the hotel's authorization for the sale of alcohol, referring to the legislation in force in the district saying that the applicants for the sale of alcohol must prove to be "good qualified".
In the original complaint lodged last year, President Donald Trump was alleged to be breaking the law, and charges of assault and repeated cases of fraud were brought.
The complaint was dismissed because the authorisation was granted before it was lodged.
The reason for the second complaint was the extension of the authorisation.
"The Sun": An intermittent report recognizes known from Cleveland police service scandals as the worst in Britain
The inspectors recognized the SCOMPROMITOVA SCANDALAM police as the worst in the United Kingdom.
In the interim report, police work in Cleveland was considered inappropriate in all areas.
Phil Gormley of the Chief Police Inspectorate of her Royal City claims that there was a "significant deterioration" of standards in Cleveland police services.
There have been new calls for police services to be dealt with, and five commanders have been appointed over the six years.
According to the report, police did not take steps to prevent crime, arrest of suspects and the protection of the weakest.
Phil Gormley of the chief police inspector of her Royal City said: "Since our last inspection, there has been a significant deterioration in standards."
Commander Mike Veale resigned in January after a year of incompetence in the face of an investigation into "significant" and unpublished charges for his conduct.
Deputy Commander Adrian Roberts has been suspended after the arrest on the ground of the alleged error.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood presented himself to the Committee on Infringements for the appointment of sexual workers.
He's out of service.
Mayor Tees Valley Ben Houchen of the tourism community said: “It is official confirmation that these services are compromised.
It's time for the Home Office department to intervene."
Police Commander Richard Lewis said: "After improvements, I take full responsibility for the conduct of police forces through changes."
We've got a scan of the skate park!
Do young people finally wait?
The older residents are hampered by young people’s passions for the rides in the caves and ski resorts, and they complain that there is no suitable place for them in Olava.
Young people have been reminded of the place to drive in wheelchairs, wheelchairs, wheelchairs, bicycles for years.
The subject is still coming back to our fractures.
For 10 years, we've been paying attention to this problem.
Last time, there's been a rumor about the lack of a skate park.
That's why we're going back to that again and asking the office what's next?
We remember that a few days ago, a woman who was in trouble with the young man who was driving in the center.
"I am writing on behalf of the inhabitants of the block at Pl. Pilsudski in order to be interested in the situation of the Olava youth," Malgorzata writes.
“The members of the block called repeatedly to the City Guard in vain.
I've sent photos to prove these everyday situations."
We asked others about this matter.
Most clearly say that young people simply don’t have a place to drive in the city and that they have no place for themselves for years to come.
Under the Facebook post, a wave of comments appeared.
We've already written in July that there's a chance that the skatepark will be built in the Olava City.
The mayor informed that the city had been funded to build a skate park.
‘The project is ready to be consulted with young people with permits.
On 28 March, an application was made to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism for the financing of the task of the "Budow Skatepark in Olava" under the Polish Sports Programme," we were told in the office.
Total project value: 798 306,00 zł.
Amount of funding requested: 263,440,00 zł.
Now we've asked again what's the point.
"We do not yet have any information on the solution to the application for funding made to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism," explains Elżbieta Bednarczyk, head of the UM Olawa European Funds Department.
"The information received from the Ministry staff shows that the final selection of all tasks under the Polish Sports Programme should take place in October."
We also asked for a visualization of the oil skate park.
We're presenting it below.
The youth informed the editorial that on Saturday (September 28th) they would collect signatures on a petition concerning the construction of the skate park in Olava.
"The rebel youth saw the last post on Facebook and came to the conclusion that they were organizing a collection," writes Mikolaj.
The signatures under the petition will be collected from 12.00 a.m. in the area of the Lidl market.
Puchar Polski 2019/20: casting 1/16 final.
We know couples, hit years ago
It was one of the most intense rivals in the extraclass.
The biggest legend has grown the memory game since 1996/1997.
On 18 June 1997, Legia took the previous team at an old stadium in the Lazinków shipyard.
Both teams shared a point.
The owners had to win, the second of the series of Polish championships gave the point to Widzew.
By 87 minutes, Legia was running 2:0, but for five more minutes, it hit the ground – Vidzew shot three goals and enjoyed the title.
The Łódź club, with its years of running, fell into ever-increasing tarapats until it stopped fighting for the championship and fell from the highest playing class.
For the last time, both teams met at this level in the 2013/2014 season.
Legia – along the way to the title – took two victories – 5:1 and 1:0 on her way out.
Return to power
At present, the ship is fighting to return to the national elite.
These plans were late for at least a year, as in previous games, one of the favorites was unable to advance to extra classrooms.
As a result of this failure in the summer, the club has reached a leather revolution.
The authorities have changed, finally put on coach Marcina Kaczmark, and in taking another step up the club hierarchy they have to help in the league fights Marcin Robak and Mateusz Možžženj.
At the time of Vidzew is fourth in table II of the League, but in Pucharze Polski won the Vice-Chairman of the Słąsk Wrocław 2:0 on Tuesday.
Legia, in the same size, won the trip to the Nepalmice Desert.
Extra-Classic Ages

Nancy Pelosi: William Barr "excited" and an investigation within the impeachment must deal with his tower
We never know where we're going.
In my opinion, we are now taking part in an attempt to hide the facts, and the investigation in this case may continue," Pelosi said in a report to the CNN on the Mount Capitol.
"They do the work they started, keeping facts and time necessary to find them," she added.
The protocol issued this week by the White House shows that Trump requested the President of Ukraine to conduct an investigation into former Vice-President Joe Biden, candidate for 2020, and his son.
Trump also asked the Greens to cooperate with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on the basis of the protocol.
Trump refused to do anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN found that national security lawyers from the Justice Department notified the complaint about the trump proceedings with Ukraine more than one week before the formal notice.
After receiving a complaint as a complaint from the officials of the Intelligence Community, the Justice Department found that Trump’s telephone conversation did not provide a criminal investigation into the financing of the campaign.
Asked whether Barr should testify, Pelosi said that on Friday, Intelligence Committee decides who to call a witness.
She added, however, that in Barr's view, "he has broken himself".
It's been like this for a long time.
"The (Barra) trades in all of this," Pelosi added, referring to Trump's reference to his Attorney-General during July's talks with the head of Ukraine.
Interestingly, he made decisions on how to deal with the complaint.
Pelosi announced that he was "very afraid" of the informants that Trump attacked on Thursday as spies, suggesting that in the past, he was treated with spies.
I think the President's words go beyond accountability, it's dangerous.
Our signalers are playing an important role in revealing – sending out advances in our government," Pelosi said, adding "The President's words about people who can provide information, signalers seriously underestimate the integrity of the government".
On Tuesday, Pelosi took a historic step of a formal investigation into the conduct of an act incompatible with the law on the basis of an alleged attempt to put pressure on the leader of a foreign country in order to gain political benefits.
The telephone conversation was included in a complaint published on Thursday, in which the signaler claimed that Trump had abused his authority to "submit Ukraine to interference" during the upcoming 2020 elections.
The signaler also proposed that the White House's lawyers have instructed the officials to delete the chattel from the computer system in which they are stored for the needs of the Council of Ministers and to place it in a system designed to be particularly sensitive.

Possible prohibition of driving too fast for a terrorist club Crystal Palace Christian Bentece
Primer League Star Christian Bentece, which has been caught twice in the last two months, threatens to prohibit the driving of vehicles.
The attacker Crystal Palace, 28 years old, was allowed to drive by Bentley's car at 80 miles per hour on the ground with a limit of up to 50 miles per hour on the road A3 in Richmond in south-western London on 20 January.
Then, in March in Putney, a photographer in South-West London registered a Belga eating at 89 miles per hour, which is a double limit of 40 miles per hour.
Bentece from Kingston Hill from Surrey doesn't have to be in court this morning at Lavender Hill.
He admitted to both proceedings at the beginning of July in the context of a simplified procedure whereby offences were more likely to be prosecuted at a meeting held by one judge of peace.

Ghana: Kofi Manu is concerned about the structure of the Recruitment Commission
Kofi Manu, the football manager and club representative Sekondi Hasacas, expressed doubts about the composition of the Recruitment Commission for upcoming elections to the National Football Union in Ghana (GFA).
He questioned the involvement of the President of the Commission, Frank Davies, adding that he was not pleased with his participation.
In the GNA Sport Manu report, he expressed doubts as to whether the President of the Commission would show honesty, as the result of the verification process lies in his interest.
The Verification Commission should consist of neutral persons from outside who do not have links with any of the members and who have not previously shown interest.
For example, Davies has been employed by NC as a lawyer who wrote to Kwak Palmer in respect of payment 10%.
He is also a well-known fan of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to take a position in the Verification Commission, because he is interested in it," he said.
Manu stated that if Fred Pappoe, Director of the Olympic Games, would appear before the Commission, there would be a conflict of interest on the part of the President because of his relationship with the club, while suggesting that if Palmer would be before the Commission, he would be the subject of prejudice and side effects.
As expected, the Commission members were expected to start their work from yesterday, following a ceremony at the GFA Secretariat in Accra on Tuesday, September 19th, and to finish it on October 4th.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies and her members are Consultant for Corporate Affairs and Lawyer Marian Barnor and Emmanuel Darkwah.
For other members, Reginald Laryea, Director of Marketing and Business and Richard Akpokavije, Sports Administrator and Lawyer.

Israel: There is no agreement on the unity government
The two main parts of Israel, the Alliance of Heaven-Whites and Liquefy, continued negotiations on the establishment of a unity government on Friday.
The meeting, which took place after the President had commissioned the formation of the Benjamin Netanyahu government, did not bring the results.
The discussion considered the possibility of rotating the leadership of both parties in the government and remaining Netanyahu at the Prime Minister's position, but, as the Israeli newspaper "Haarec" says, there was no convergence of views.
The talks will be resumed on Sunday.
The Central Alliance of the White Sky informed in the communication that it had submitted preliminary submissions.
He accuses the legal Lukud of “recovery in his positions”, insisting that his leader and former Prime Minister, Netanyahu, remain at the head of the government, and in the office’s membership, which was previously part of his ultra-orthodox policy.
"From the very beginning, it was known that the Blue-Beials would not agree to these conditions," the communication was published by them.
I mean, acting solely in the interest of Netanyahu, he wants to "make the second round of elections in Israel".
The heavenly-White Leader, Benny Gantz, rejects the support of the government that would lead Netanyahu, as long as they bear a charge of participation in three corrupt cases, on which the prosecution could formally accuse him on the basis of which he was appointed on the basis of the meeting.
"In the elections on 17 September, the people and the Whites received a sufficient majority, which would allow them to be joint governments as natural allies, but it forces them to negotiate which neither of the parties would have wanted," writes the EFE Agency.
President Reuwen Rivlin has been trying to bring their positions closer in recent days and has proposed the call for a "rotating government", suggesting that the Prime Minister temporarily suspend his functions, which would allow Gantz to take up this position if charges against Netanyahu were maintained and formalised.
There are no Israeli analysts who think things have been locked in a blind spot.
However, half of the Israelis, as a result of the poll published on Friday on public television, wish to unlock the political situation in the country by calling on the government of unity under the rotating leadership to replace Netanyahu and Gantza.
This is the case with 50.6% of the Israelis, 32.1% of the respondents oppose such a solution.
The survey shows a deep division in the Israeli society – on the question who should first stand in the office, 41.8% of respondents speak for Netanyahu, and 40% for Gantzem.
In another survey published by the Israel Hague newspaper, the percentage of the union's supporters rose to 63%, 60% opposed to the new elections, which would be third this year.
In the preliminary parliamentary elections on 17 September, Gantza's alliance won 33 mandates in the 120th Cuneiform, Likud Netanyahu defeated 32 mandates.
Netting with its traditional and potential allies can count on 55 ambassadors, while Gantz is 54.
None of the sensitivities have collected 61 mandates required to obtain the majority.
Tipuric calls for the fight before the final game with Australians
Justin Tipuric says that "it's time to check out", when Valia faces the final game with Australia in the World Cup, which can shape their fates in the tournament.
The victory of Valia over the kangaroos would put this team in the position of a favorite to win Group D and guarantee its participation in the likely quarterly meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia beats Wallia once 14 during the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be sent to the beginning of England in one eight finals.
"Let's make the case clear, both teams want to try and get to the top of the group," said the Valianian warrior Tipuric.
In the past, there were some difficult results, but last autumn it was nice to win with them (Australia).
I think they're going to be impatient to take over this victory, and we're going to have to take it back.
Before we got here, you knew it was gonna be a big old man.
And now we're here, and it's really time to check it out.
Valia won only one victory over Australia, New Zealand or RPA in the history of the World Cup – and this was 32 years ago in a third place match when the kangaroos were defeated.
And their total record under the leadership of Chief Coach Warren Gatland shows only seven victories in 41 attempts to defeat three heavy-weighted teams from the South Pole.
Valia represented thirteen of Australia's lost test matches in November last year, and Tipuric prepared to be among the few saved from this 9-6 victory who will run to the Tokyo stadium on Sunday.
Tipuric asked whether the team had experienced psychological blockades before the victory, adding: “It’s hard to say.
These swords are so balanced that maybe... people expect a mental blockade to occur, I don't know.
At the end of the last match we probably left on the battlefield about 15 points, so the final result seems to be much less advantage than it actually was.
If Valia tumbling, then the battle of Tipurica with a popular Australian duo from the third line will be of fundamental importance to Michael Hooper and David Pocock during the arrest and execution.
Tipuric played 67 meetings in representation colors and met with both contestants on a few previous occasions, so he knows exactly what's waiting for him.
"These are the champions playing in the position of the seventh absolutely world class," he said.
When playing against the world class of third line fighters, it is always known that the game will be difficult to play.
These two are always with the best racers in the world.
You know what games you can expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is a more attacking seven and probably better feeling rough, because he's always in the right place at the right time.
It's better to play against the best racers in the world and face challenges than to measure with the third line of mill, which is not so good.
It's worth playing against the best, and fighting with these two, I'm sure you have to be in the top form.
I wouldn't say that Sunday would be almost the end of the spider, but for us, it's an important match in this World Cup.
Impet is its important element.
When we build strength and continue to make great efforts, we will fly like on wings, and it will be hard for us to overcome.

They were supposed to be an elite organisation of the "races of gentlemen".
They've taken in their ranges those they've been saving.
Could a crime be more powerful than a national identity?
In your hands, we give you no further war or military book.
We are conducting a deep international study on the participation of non-Germans in the Waffen-SS.
Historians from various European countries are examining the attitudes and motivations of volunteers, recalling their activities and observing the recruitment process at various stages of the war.
Did the Danish branches differ from the French?
Where did Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why couldn't a Polish team be created?
What is the official historical narrative of cooperation in individual European countries today?
What happened to the volunteers after the war ended?
Among other questions, the Waffen-SS book answers on the basis of solid research material.
We have sought to present a more subtle and more balanced, closer image of cooperation in Europe during the second world war, also trying to break the methodological boundaries of historiography and a given period of action by presenting the debate of the research authority from different countries. (...) While the main victims of this war are forced workers, Jews, Greeks, Nazi political opponents Germany, Slovenian people - are sometimes presented in comparison and/or supranational terms, so many are examined from the national perspective (if they do so).
"Total panic" when the White House is struggling to find arguments about impeachment
White House officials boast of how to resist the pressure on impeachment on Thursday, and one of the speakers who are familiar with the situation describes the feeling of "total panic" that was felt last week due to the lack of a response plan to the new reality.
It seems that this is due to "an anxiety, uncertainty and fear" - one of the people involved in the White House thus describes the tension in the western wing - that the accusations of the informant can seriously harm the president and the people in his surroundings.
This person said, "There is no doubt that nothing is hidden there."
The White House officials were still uncertain how to proceed, not only because there is no clear plan of action in such a situation, but also because the charges are so serious that standard methods of avoiding effective controversy used by the president in the past may not work. "It does not look like something that will disappear along with the emergence of another cycle of headlines" – this person complained.
Another person who knows the debate described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of shock" accompanied by growing distrust that, together with the ongoing investigation into impeachment, the likelihood of the president being irresponsible and becoming "hard to control" will increase.
This concern is shared by another speaker claiming that people from the president's environment expect him to manifest a more "continuous" behaviour and the pressure on him will certainly increase with every day of the impeachment investigation.
This gives rise to concern that Trump can present increasingly unpredictable behaviour and in an unexpected way explode – it is in the context of the election year both in terms of the presidency and the elections.
Faced with the greatest threat to the presidency so far, Trump has circled from the attack to the defense, again reaching out to the strategy that he considered to be effective during Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia.
He tried to enrich his own request to the Ukrainian president for assistance in the investigation of his political rivals in order to draw attention to the actions of Democrats and Democratic Candidate Joe Biden and to discredit the informant as a driving force for parties.
But while many people in the White House are being fought after the search for Mueller, this time something changed – counselors and consultants said.
The President, whose reputation is a force, showed the media conference as a defeat – one of the people who knew the situation.
While Trump enthusiastically accepted questions about the Russian investigation, he seemed reluctant to answer questions about Ukraine – they said.
Some of the president's associates believe that damage can be avoided, and some of them hold that the informant did not know from the first hand about that controversial telephone conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Zelenski – which they consider to be unreliable.
And as often as the president is the object of the attacks, the fact is alive raised by his main advocates in his defense.
But one of the Republican strategies related to the White House shows that the results of the presidential support polls are poorly high, and impeachment does not have much to do with obtaining new sympathy.
"There is no point in focusing on the President's impeachment in the next four months," especially if his legislative programme makes it difficult and prevails in the new cycle of headlines.
Another speaker argues that those who maintained that the impeachment would help the president did not finally understand how unforeseeable his reaction would be.
Concerned officials of the White House sought help with counsellors by completing an impeachment response team.
According to the person with knowledge of the plans, taking into account that these efforts are at an early stage, it remains unclear whether any initiatives in the management centre will be taken and what form it can take.
This person stated that it is to be believed that a coordinated legal and communication strategy is required with a determined leader who is able to carry out an attack on the PR in response to the publication of the edible report of the signator and who aims to prevent the spread of the democratic activities relating to the impeachment of the report.
The speaker on the situation maintains that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clearly evident when the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Treasury Secretary Steve Munuchin stated that they did not intend to disclose the notes describing Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president, and then 48 hours later it could be felt that there was no exit and that the document should be published.
It is expected that the pressure will be greater now than during Robert Mueller's investigation, which mainly kept silence and spoke only through accusations. One of the people who can be involved in the development of the response to impeachment is Corey Lewandowski, a man from the dirty work Trump and was head of the election staff – a person related to the case.
However, Lewandowski said in a conversation with NBC News that it is not a true suggestion that he will lead this action.
"For the past five years, I have done everything I could to support the president and his programme," he said, "but I have not been involved in any talks with the president or his team to join the team in order to reject a false narrative about the impeachment."
Private lawyer Donald Trump from Mueller's investigation, Jay Sekulow, also remains involved in impeachment actions.
"We are responding to matters as appropriate" – Seculow replied when asked by NBC News about the comment.
Currently, the White House feels the lack of an experienced lawyer in the field of impeachment, after Emma Flood, who worked at Clinton's impeachment and advised the White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, left, and the current advisor, Pat Cipollone, has no such experience.
The speaker, familiar with the White House's strategy, stated that officials in general did not plan at any time to engage people or to create a centre of leadership, but admitted that the need for a coordinated, joint response and people capable of conducting a political struggle.
Visitor Explorer of the Sea line Royal Caribbean passed repair for 89 million pounds
The explorer of the Seas, belonging to the Royal Caribbean International family, will take this year on a trip, presenting a completely new look.
After the restoration, which cost 110 million dollars (89 million pounds), the ship boasts a wide selection of culinary flavors from all over the world and a rich offer of entertainment for the entire family.
This year, Explorer will stop at the most wonderful ports in Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to feel the taste of the Mediterranean Europe.
When the adventure on land reaches its end, the crew of the ship promises unforgettable impressions on the sea.
Having a satisfaction offer for everyone, the Explorer, after renovating $110 million, or about $89 million, moved to a passenger ship that provides a perfect entertainment for the entire family.
The impressive technology means that passengers can surf on board through advanced surfing simulators or watch a favorite family movie using weather spells in a movie.
However, the most revolutionary attraction is the addition of virtual balconies that allow passengers of the interior cabins to admire ocean views without having to leave on board.
Water lovers will be attracted to a newly designed deck at the pool connecting the Caribbean style of the water park.

As a second European ship belonging to the Royal Caribbean line, it will join the Allure of the Seas, which has recently passed an incredible repair.
After 58-day Allure metamorphosis, a huge amount of $165 million, the tour operator offered guests who had previously made reservations, a voucher worth $300 to be delivered on board the ship.
The tour operator said: “Explorer of the Seas is the fourth Voyager class ship, which will undergo a transformation into the modernization of the Royal Amplified Fleet."
The program, which requires investment of more than $1 billion, comprising 10 ships and lasting four years, improves every aspect of customer satisfaction and introduces a wide range of possibilities: from unrepeatable attractions and survive gastronomic after nightlife.
Devin Nunes accuses the Democrats of calling for "signs of trump"
Congressman Devin Nunes from the state of California is obviously not able to refute the fact that President Donald Trump's investigation is under way.
In his Thursday defense, the President accused the Democrats of wanting to receive naked photos of the President.
Nunes, a high-ranking Republican member of the Commission of the Conference of Representatives, put the above-mentioned proposal in the course of the preliminary statement during the hearing on the results of the complaint, as if Trump had turned to Ukraine for assistance in initiating an investigation against the Democratic candidate for President Joe Biden and his son.
The congressman called the Ukrainian scandal "a grotesque presentation" of the left and their "medial ace" before he found that the Democrats wanted to see pictures of the president in the neighborhood.
"Democrats in this committee were negotiating with people they thought were Ukrainians to get naked pictures of Trump," Nunes said.
“People can rightly ask why the Democrats are so determined to put the president in charge of the prosecution when they have their chance in a year.
When Nunes ended up giving the publicity, the political reporter of HuffPost's website, Jennifer Bendery, decided to see if the Democrats really were trying to... find out.
So far, only the representative Connecticut, Jim Hims, has responded, although we suspect that his answer is a sudden truth, confirming the thoughts of many of his colleagues and colleagues.
The Mediaite.com Portal suspects that Nunesa's comments on nuances were related to "some more favourable and unconfirmed information", which is likely to appear in Steele's controversial documents,
It is celebrated, collected by former British spy Christopher Steele's collection of charges against Trump, indicating the likelihood of the existence of a tape, which at midnight shows him watching the violence of prostitutes in the hotel room in Moscow.
Potential studies on renewable biofuels can help reduce emissions
While electric cars and Sami Tesli have dominated information services in recent years, one issue seems to be the removal of renewable energy — aircraft.
However, a professor at Alberta University has developed a technology that will enable renewable biofuels to be used as aviation fuels.
Dr David Bressler is a professor at Albert University for agriculture, life and the environment, who started working on this project in 2003.
Its laboratory develops hydrocarbons derived from fatty wastes, such as restaurant fats, animal fats and waste oil.
In contrast to ethanol and other biofuels, this technology may use lower-quality oil during production, which is estimated to account for 85% lower carbon emissions than in the case of petroleum fuels, as well as for waste from other industries.
This technology is intended to imitate hydrocarbons present in oil fuels.
"What our technology did in the first generation," said Bressler, "is [in total] hydrocarbons that are identical particles as in diesel."
While this opens up the new possibility of using biofuels, the previously developed biofuels have seen a tendency to destabilize at lower temperatures, which in the case of aircraft flying at high altitudes was a serious threat.
"The problem with fuel airports is a bit of a bad cycle," Bressler said.
It's really less worth than diesel, but it has higher requirements.
The Bressler Laboratory is currently looking at two options for the production of aerial biofuels.
The first option is a low-risk approach that requires additional treatment of hydrocarbons and hydrogen.
The second option is to continue working on partially developed chemical properties that will provide fuel stability, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little," said Bressler, commenting on another option.
This option is more risky.
The spray company created by the University of Alberta, Forge Hydrocarbons, works on product commercialization, as airlines, as well as the Canadian and American armies increase investment in a renewable option.
"They are able to imagine the times in which the situation may be reversed and they will be taxed on coal," he said.
They want this alternative, which is going to be an emergency plan.
Forge is currently operating a pilot plant near the Edmonton Waste Management Centre and has recently received a sum of $4 million from Lockheed Martin in an investment to support a costing $25 million construction plant located in Sombra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce about 19 million gallons of biofuel per year.
Bressler also notes that the planned reduction of coal will be about 85 per cent, but issues such as transport and fuel production stop further reduction.
“As a technology specialist,” Bressler said, “
I have the task of developing options that allow for informed decisions and many choices."
SUCCESS: Another cheating on the granddaughter
Eight thousand dollars and 750 euros lost the property of Zamosta, thinking that it helped his grandson who had an accident.
The police informed him of the incident on Thursday of the son of a cheated replacement.
“He called the woman in the middle of a man who gave up for her granddaughter.
He told me he had an accident and needed money.
Otherwise he's going to jail.
The senior wanted to help the grandson, she handed 8 thousand dollars and 750 euros to the fake cop who came to her house," says Asp. Dorota Krukowski-Bubila from the foreign police.
The police are looking for agents and once again they call for caution:
‘Each phone with a request for financial assistance must be verified.
Do not act under the influence of emotion and in a hurry.
Remember, the cops don't ask for money and they don't take money.
If we receive a call asking for financial support, which will stimulate our suspicions, we should respond immediately and notify the police by calling on alert number 112.
We also appeal to younger family members.
Let's talk to our seniors about threats, let's let them know how deception works.

One of the main cabinet ministers said last night that the country would be threatened by a "social collapse" if the original result was challenged by the result of the second referendum.
The British Prime Minister's allies from his immediate surroundings warned that the country was threatened by social concerns on the scale of the "yellow chameleon" protests in France due to social inequalities and interference in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for "peace of mind" during a heated debate on the language of politics, but stressed that he would not stop using the word "referencing".
Despite his call for peace, the cabinet minister said "The Times": "In this country there have never been protests such as demonstrations of "gilets young" ("yellow chamelek") or residents of Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible, just because they didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – young gilettes – they use encrypted phones that can coordinate picettes, and to get people to protest, there are only a few unwanted populist leaders.
The residents of Los Angeles exploded after the jury defeated four white policemen who had taken over the black cab driver Rodney King in 1992.
This year, the anti-government demonstrators in France wearing yellow gowns – young gillet – have been deserting the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.
The minister referred to Johnson's warning in the Gmin Chamber and said that if Britain fails to leave the EU, there will be "a catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system".
"If we organise a referendum in which 30 million people vote and 66% of them will be left behind in the European Union, ten million citizens will not be satisfied," the Minister said.
Even if that result ignores 99% of them, we will have 100,000 angry people who will write to their emissaries and who will not forgive.
A lot of people don't need to see a few thousand people on the street soon.
One of the prime ministers of the cabinet added that the country is threatened with "a major social breakdown", if the result of the first referendum is questioned by the result of the second.
Johnson called for a general election in which voters would decide on the brexit gap.
According to the report, the prime minister is facing the risk of a cabinet bomb that wants to reduce the demand for brexit and to reach a compromise agreement with the EU at this point.
Crowds, Crowds and Croats have been fascinated in Krakow.
Follow us Talk'N"Roll
More than 300 participants listened on Thursday (September 26th) to 11 inspiring lectures of lecturers, including Szymon Holovnia, Krystyna Czubavna or Ireneusz Krosna.
This is all part of the Talk'N'Roll conference that took place in Krakow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Extending the horizons, talking about the sound of voice and joint discussions that can be a boost to further development.
These objectives were presented by the organizers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, inviting 11 exceptional speakers, representing very diverse sectors and areas of interest, among them people known from the media - Shimona Holovnj, Kristina Chubovna and Ireneus Krosna.
The theme of this year's talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the Future, NOW" and about the creation of the future focused on the presence of guests invited to attend the conference.
The first session was opened by the director of Sabre Polska, Sebastian Drzewiecki, who told us how the brand that is built around him could affect our future.
Richard Lucas went on the stage to change the public perception of the phenomenon of rejection, claiming that it should be accepted if the future was to be created, Chris Badura took on the issue of empathy in the event of the flashing development of technology.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) shared observations and techniques that can help manage careers and increase overall satisfaction by finding an appropriate balance between professional and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a wide-ranging conversation with Christina Chubovna, which told among other things how her perspective on space changed the lecturer’s career in Poland.
The owner of one of the most popular voices in the country admitted that, thanks to development technology, everyone today can make this profession difficult.
However, he does not consider that in the near future a person in the position of a lecturer is completely replaced by technology.
After her, Piotr Nabibelec took on the problem of life in times of overloading information, emotional or overloading in the matter of choice, giving the public valuable clues how to deal with it, and Lukash Lętocha, in his speech, talked about what another industrial revolution, known as the "Community 4.0" might lead to.
Learning fun, learning fun
The conference organizers also took care of the artistic impressions, inviting the illusionist Daniel Jedinak to the scene.
The third part of the conference opened from Ireneusz Krosny, who first played the public pantonium, and then – for example, on his own career – told us how he was trying to maintain a proper balance between his career on stage and private life.
Szymon Holovnia also took his stand, stressing, above all, the role of time in our lives.
The publicist pointed out that even two minutes can change the situation in a diametrical way and need to be ready to use this time.
In addition, Holovnia shared his thoughts on reality, calling for anecdotes that could have caused smiles on the face of the eyes.
Then appeared Adrian Tworuszka, who reviewed the history and objectives of several innovation models and related them to how they are currently being used.
At the end of Marcin Sloviak, for example, the Rubika, told of an approach to solving problems.
Each of the 11 speakers has certainly made a new contribution in view of the reality of all those who had the opportunity to see the performances, and the life-responsibility and many questions to the guests are a matter of great public engagement.
The organizers provided a broadcast for all who could not personally participate in the event, and the recordings from the lectures are available on the website.
Governments are legal instead of governments of law.
"In spite of the lack of sufficient votes to amend the Constitution, the governing majority introduced a number of changes in the state system, putting at risk the rule of law and the principles of the trifle of power," the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, published on Thursday, writes.
The report 'The rule of law instead of the rule of law' documents, inter alia, changes in the scale of justice and in the sphere of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) published a report entitled “The rule of law instead of the rule of law.
Threats to the protection of human rights in Poland from 2015 to 2019".
The Foundation assesses in the report that the largest return in the field of human rights in Poland was recorded between 2015 and 2019 after 1989.
"Despite the lack of sufficient votes to amend the Constitution, the ruling majority introduced a number of amendments to the State system, creating threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principle of triple power.
By adapting the law to political objectives, the rule of law has been replaced by the rule of law," HFPC experts write.
What about the HFPC report?
The report documents changes in the functioning of justice, independent institutions (such as the public media or the Ombudsman) and in the field of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, LGBT people's rights and the right to a fair trial).
The report also summarizes a three-year dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union.
"In the last four years, for the first time and on such a scale, we have observed the use of the right to exercise the partial interests of the parties.
This has led to an ongoing legal crisis, as well as a weakening of the entire human rights system in Poland," said lawyer Marcin Volny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As indicated in the report, the past four years have been a "systemic period of change both in the country" and a "for the protection of human rights".
Over the past four years, Seim has adopted more than 20 key legal acts in terms of human rights protection.
"The changes were often adopted at a rapid pace, without social consultation and despite the legal environment reservations, the Ombudsman for Citizens' Rights or international organisations," said Lawyer Malgorzat Szuleka, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the past four years are: “the weakening of independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), the non-compliance with binding judgments of courts and recommendations of international institutions and the weakening of the guarantee of the protection of human rights”.
State authorities have not responded
In particular, the Helsinki Foundation for Human Affairs considered "the situations in which State authorities did not react or even considered the cases of aggression to be a matter of concern".
The Foundation’s experts noted that some changes have been introduced in the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or professional groups or groups affected by discrimination.
The Foundation indicates that the result of the State's activities in the field of limiting the rule of law is a ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities with the European Union and a number of recommendations by international law actors.
"The lack of implementation of these recommendations not only weakens Poland's position as a leader of democratic change in the Central and Eastern European region, but also affects the Polish State for its responsibility for violating European Union law or the European Convention on Human Rights," we read in the report.
Brother of Pakistani social media star with life for honour killing
Experts on women's rights claim that the investigation of justice is often difficult due to prolonged proceedings, the release of suspects for the prosecution and the public awareness of cases.
"It takes so long for people to forget," says Farzana Bari, the defender of women's rights and the founder of the first gender study department in Pakistan, and adds that even the widespread issue of Baloch's murder has been resolved for more than three years.
Although, according to the women's rights fighting groups, reliable data are difficult to establish, the Pakistani Human Rights Commission identified at least 300 cases of so-called honour killings in 2018.
Many activists claim that the real number is much higher, and the network promoting awareness of honour crimes estimates that there are about one fifth of the 5,000 honour killings in Pakistan worldwide every year.
Record earnings of Poles abroad
However, transfers to the country are small, because many immigrants are staying outside Poland on a permanent basis – the "Rzeczpospolita" is on Friday.
The latest report by Euro-Tax shows that the average earnings of Polish workers in other European countries amounted to over 8,6 thousand dollars in 2018, which means that they have grown by almost a thousand gold, or almost 12%.
Euro-Tax "estimates that the total income of Polish migrant workers in the countries of the Union reached a record value of 154.5 billion zł in 2018, by one seventh more than a year earlier", we read.
Director of the Centre for Migration of the University of Warsaw, Paweł Kaczmarczyk, says that Poland is increasingly working on the international labour market, where various available options are used.
"There are also increasing numbers of specialists and professionals who move from country to country in search of ever better conditions, like international corporate workers," the newspaper reports.
Some of Euro-Tax customers work in two countries during the year, such as the United Kingdom and Germany.
‘This is the largest in the RFN in 2018, because 11% of total earnings of Polish immigrants (up to about 27 billion zł).
However, most of them captured Poles on the island – almost 35 billion evils," we read on.
The President of the Euro-Taxu considers that despite the improvement of working conditions in the Polish market, the number of migrant workers is not diminishing.
As I continue to see the Saxons in the West and in the North of Europe (in front of Norway) it is often a chance for a few times higher earnings than in Poland.
"It is even at minimum rates in a given country, which, for example, in Germany is €9.5-11.7 per hour," the newspaper reports.
The "Rzeczpospolita" suggests that the Polish stay not only because of higher wages, but also because they have settled abroad.
Many Poles leave behind a border of roots, which is also seen after small transfers of money to the country.
Those last year were the lowest of years.
As economist Tadeusz Chrzyszcki points out, along with the extension of the stay abroad, a small group of people who transfer money to the country and decreases their height.
"Emigrants draw close," we read in the Friday "Rzeczpospolit".
Prolonged monsoons cause floods and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India has been extending for almost a month, and unaffected rainfalls cause death due to the drying of buildings and the humidity of many soils.
Usually, in the northern Indian monsoons, in early September, the average rainfall in the month exceeded 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation continues for a few more days, it will be the most late monsoon ending in decades.
In many areas of the country, rainfalls are still unaffected – in recent times in western India, the cities of Pune and the rainy rainforests have led to the deaths of dozens of people and the loss of buildings.
There's been a storm of homes, people crawling through the streets in the water by their knees, which usually only takes place during the apogeum of the monsoon.
Large rains also occurred in cities such as Calcutta, Luknow and Hajdarabad.
As a result of the long-lasting rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand, many homes were destroyed.
Monsun also started late.
In many areas there was no water, so farmers prepared for a possible drought.
The long-lasting monsoon is not well seen by farmers.
That amount of rain is not normal for this year.
"Through him my vegetables – and now I have a hat, beans, mushrooms and tomatoes – will rot," says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal in Uttarakhand state.
For consumers, the late effects, as well as the late end of the monsoon, mean a rise in the price of the onions, that is, the ingenious ingredient of Indian foods.
The Cebula, which usually had to pay 20 rupees (0.23 pounds of British), currently costs 80 rupees (about 1 pound of British) per kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Bombay.
Festivals and festivals are also at risk.
Another great festival is the 8th October of the Holy Dasar, during which the Hindus raise huge bells as from a comic, representing Ravena, to be with a blush and a vicious smile from the "Ramajana" epoch.
Ravany's burning symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, taking into account that similar Ravens were made out of paper, if the monsoon continues to last, Ravana will laugh last.
Implementation of the Energy Synergy Technology Sp. z o.o. for restructuring
On 27 September 2019, the Bank account of the Fund affected the sale price of 26,843 shares in Energy Synergie Technology Sp. z o.o. in restructuring amounting to EUR 100000.
The same ownership of these shares went to INDOS S.A. with its headquarters in Croatia.
The participation agreement was concluded in connection with the rejection of the other participants from the right to acquire the shares and, as a result, of their consent to the remainder of the shareholders to whom the authorisation was granted.

Doodle celebrates 21 Google birthdays
It would be hard to imagine a world without Google today.
In the search engine, we're looking for answers to all the questions we ask.
What are we looking for in Google?
"What is it?", "Where?", "How?" and "How?" are one of the favorite categories sought by Polish.
The giant data shows that last year we were willing to ask, among other things, about "Where is the bull?", "How to make the spaghetti?" and "How many fingers has the horse?", "How to get rid of the fruit muscle?", "How to eat some?".
Today the search engine is about the twenty-first birthday.
Its users – and in Poland up to 96% use Google Uncle – welcome today to Google Doodle.
This time it's not animated.
Google recalls its birthdays, showing a stationary computer with a monitor, mouse and keyboard, and in the right, bottom corner, a digital date was printed – as on a picture from the year 90.
Catalogue of information
The searcher was created for a specific purpose – to catalogue all possible information and make it available via the Internet.
Her name is a word game.
It comes from the mathematical term google, meaning the number of ten raised to the power of a hundred.
This title was also intended to reflect the company's intention to index as the largest number of sites from global Internet resources.
Google's search engine was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationship between the parties, which worked better than the normal method of segregation of the results based on the frequency of the phrase.
At the beginning, the search engine carried the name BlackRub, which refers to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages referring to the result.
Page and Brin set up a company operating under Google Inc. on September 7, 1998, and later launched the famous website google.com today.
What's up, Google?
In December 1998, information on the extremely high frequency of Google search results appears in the PC Magazine.
Then the company's history seems almost like a fairy tale - a brilliant development with every month, a subjugation of other markets and an increase in company value.
Already in June 2000 the Google URL index has over billion locations, making Page and Brina the world's largest Internet search engine.
Currently, the company founded by Page and Brina is one of the leading players on the IT market.
So is there another field for development?
"The Google mission is an organization of global information resources to be widely available and useful, even though we have made huge progress in this area, it is still a long way to achieve this goal," said Piotr Zalewski from Google Poland.
Common contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
The new study suggests that exposure to plant protection products at a high level may lead to a high risk of heart failure in later years of life.
This was the case with a group of Japanese-born Americans in Hawaii, which has been studied for more than 30 years.
Scientists found that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the highest contact with them were 45% more affected by heart disease or stroke.
"This study underlines the need to use personal protective equipment during contact with pesticides at work and the importance of identifying in medical records contact with such agents at work, as well as to control standard factors that increase heart failure," said Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez co-author.
She's a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in the Manoa district.
The results are based on data from more than 6,000 men on the island of Oahu who participated in the Kukini Honolulu cardiology program.
As scientists have pointed out, the results of the study may not apply to women and other populations because it was only for men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have a long half-life of breakdown, so their effects on health can be reported many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years after contact with plant protection substances.
In a press release, Rodriguez reported: “After 34 years of male observation, the relationship between exposure to pesticides and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant. ”
It was so likely because more important factors were related to aging that masked possible causal relationships between exposure to pesticides and the vulnerability to the disease of the circulation system in later years of life.
Researchers have not found a significant relationship between exposure to small to moderate amounts of plant protection products and increased risk of heart disease or stroke.
Phone conversation Zölenski-Trump: Poroszenko presents her three coins
Washington's policy has been gruesome for a week since the start of the impeachment procedure against US President Donald Trump.
Getting used to the political scandal is for the political debate of Wolodymyr Zelenski's situation, which he would like to avoid.
But what do we really know about the Green-Trump affair, and will it have far-reaching effects for the first one?
Nearly at the start of Trump's phone call, the United States has declared to Greenland that it is doing more for Ukraine than European countries.
Despite the fact that the notes revealed by the White House are not complete, they describe in detail the Trump attack on the Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel because Germany's leaders, along with other leaders of European countries, engage in negotiations instead of presenting concrete proposals.
The controversy sparked a Green response, which announced that it was not 100%, but 1000%.
Zelenski added that both the French President Macron and Merkel are insufficiently trying to help Ukraine.
This exchange of views led politicians, in particular from the Ukrainian opposition, to decide to vote through social services.
Peter Porosenko, former President of Ukraine, stated on Twitter that the EU's support was "without precedent".
In other tweets, Porosenko said he was grateful for the EU's support during the "Russian aggression", which included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their concerns, including Ukrainian politicians Victoria Voytsitska said, "How can we talk to Germany and France now?"
Trump then referred to military aid and requested the Greens to investigate not one but two cases: the first concerning the son of Joe Biden – Hunter – and the second concerning the entry into the DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacker attack on the e-mails of the Democrats during the 2016 elections.
It is not known whether it describes this European relationship, or whether it will cause relations with the leader of France and Germany to be broken.
I don't want to talk bad about anyone...
We thank everyone who is helping us" – he announced after the publication of a telephone interview with Zelenski in New York during the UN General Assembly.
Zelenski is to meet with the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the upcoming summit of the "Nordic Square", which will take place in October.
Former District Inspector Legally Deserved
The court has cleared Jerzy Wisnievsky of his crimes.
After 6 years Jerzy Wisniewski was finally cleared of the charges.
The District Court of Industry has cleared Jerzy Wisniewski, former head of the Trade Quality Inspectorate of Roll-Food Products in Rzeszow, on the charge of breach of the powers.
The Lubela prosecutor accused him of betraying the former Marshallian voivodship of the control term in the food oil production plant.
He has recently made a legal ruling in this regard.
The appeal was recognized on 12 September.
"The Court maintained the judgment of the defendant," confirmed Judge Malgorzata Reiser, spokesman for the District Court of Industry.
This is the judgment of 14 February issued by the Regional Court of Industry.
Jerzy Wisnijewski then commented on Facebook: “It was six years since I was presented by the Appeals Office in Lublin with a alleged violation of the law in a telephone conversation with the Mayor of Podkarpacki on April 30, 2012.
The court has clearly stated that I am innocent, and I did not break the existing law at the time.
I was convinced that my telephone conversation with the Mayor of Podkarpacki was in line with the current law.
The version of the events published in 2013 by the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Appeal in Lublin was true and caused irreversible damage both to the food producer’s entrepreneurs and to the loss of my personal image in my employers, among employees and in the local community.
The action brought against me in the Court's opinion contained a number of errors, false facts, inconsistencies of the legal basis, not confirmed in fact.
With the help of CBA in Rzeszwe, everything was done to eliminate me from public and professional life.
I was immediately released from work and without financial resources.
I've been staying for a long time with my wife."
Let's remember.
Jerzy Wisniewski served as a provincial quality trade inspector for agricultural and food products between 2009 and 2013.
He was dismissed after the prosecution in Lublin filed charges in 2013.
According to the survey, he had to betray the current voivodship in a telephone conversation (Mirosław Karapyta was sentenced to 4 years of freedom) the time limit for the control of the plant producing oil which belongs to the wife of the current vice-president of the sub-carpack.
This warning – as prosecutors from Lublin claimed – was to cause the company's owner to know about the controls and correct labels on the oils that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wisniewski heard the charges of a violation of his privileges, which threatened to deprive him of his liberty for up to 3 years.
"I feel relieved that this case has finally ended and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning, I was convinced that I did not do anything wrong, which is now the final confirmation of a legitimate verdict that denouncing me from my charges," Jerzy Wisniewski commented.
The White House tried to hide the conversation with Zelenski
In a Thursday edited report, the signaler wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Zelenski, was engaged in the interference of the country in the US election, and the White House was trying to hide the record of this conversation.
The Presidents of Ukraine and the United States
In an anonymous report dated August 12th, which is probably an intelligence officer, he wrote: “In my duties, I have been informed by many members of the American government that the President has used his role to seek foreign interference in the 2020 election in the United States.”
‘Trump used part of the conversation (with Green) to realize its own interests.
And exactly – he tried to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take steps that would help the president in the referendum in 2020," the report quoted by the newspaper "The Hill" said.
The leader of Ukraine is "given to understand" that contact with Trump depends on whether "will show the willingness to take the game" in matters which the lawyer of President Rudy Giuliani had to inform him more precisely.
The author admits that he was not a witness to the conversation, but stresses that he was informed in detail about its contents by "many white house officials who had direct information on this subject", and their relations were covered.
“The following days after this discussion, I learned from many American officials that the high rankings of representatives of the White House have intervened to ‘flame’ all the archived records of this conversation, and in particular the verbal record that has been prepared, as usual, in the crisis room of the White House”, we read on.
"The high ranking of White House officials told me that White House lawyers "commanded them to remove electronic records from the computer system in which such records are stored.
It was transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store and manipulate information in particular," the author wrote.
"In my assessment, these steps show that the officials of the White House have been aware of the importance of what happened during the conversation," the signalist assessed.
As the AP commented, this document will probably speed up the proceedings on the possible impeachment of the President and also contain valuable information on witnesses who can confirm this relationship.
The interview with the Green White House, after the Congress's press, was made available on the inside, but not on the basis of electronic records, but on the basis of the relationships of the people who were witnesses to it.
The content of the report, in the edited version, was published later on by the Committee of the Representatives' Chamber.
Also on Thursday, the executive director of the US intelligence, Joseph Maguire, testified to the Committee of Inquiry of the House of Representatives and explained how he had dealt with the report of the intelligence officer.
Maguire said that the signaler made the right choice and did as the law says.
He also stressed that, in his view, the conference with the Greens was an event "without a precedent".
The democracies in the committee of inquiry asked Maguire why he blocked the release of the Congress's report; the director of the investigation refused that he had no right to disclose its content, which is a secret guarantee of the so-called privileges of the executive authority.
Part of Maguire's hearing by the Commission was held behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, informed that, due to the suspicion that the President had put pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to harm their potential rival in the next presidential elections, the House of Representatives launched a investigation that could lead to the impeachment of Trump.
The day later, she found that Trump's interview with the Greens confirmed that the president of the United States broke election and security standards.
Election law in the United States prohibits the use of foreign aid.
However, the justice resort assessed that the president did not break the electoral law. On Thursday, the spokesperson of the White House, Stephanie Grisham, said that there was "nothing wrong" in the discussion, and in the report, "there is nothing more than a collection of relations from a third hand and a pair of press releases".
"The White House will continue to criticise this history of the media and the false narrative promoted by the main nurturing media," she added.
Ghana receives two ICAO awards
Ghana won two prestigious awards during the 40th International Civil Aviation (ICAO) Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The security award was awarded in proof that Ghana has reached the highest number of points in Africa in the aviation security oversight, i.e. 89.89 per cent in the area of the provisional rate of effective implementation (EI).
This occurred when ICAO completed its ICVM control on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the UN Aviation Safety Audit Programme.
The protection award was evidence of the country's high commitment to the implementation of ICAO's standards and protection protocols at airports and in Ghana's airspace.
The award programme was designed to support the ICAO initiative No. Country Left Behind.
In addition, ICAO Member States, which have improved their safety and safety standards, have been granted 16 other safety certificates and 17 safety certificates.
During the award ceremony for Ghana, the Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, Director General of the Ghana Civil Aviation Office, Simon Allotey, Ambassador of Ghana in Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo and Managing Director of Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa.
In his speech, the President of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Olumuiwa Benard Aliu, stressed the need to maintain safety in the airspace of the Member States.
He said, "It is important for us to keep in mind that even in the time of innovation, the safety of aviation protection and sustainable development must remain our fundamental priorities."
In his view, Mr Adda noted that the awards were a huge achievement for the state's efforts, as they complement hard work and industry endurance.
He also added that the aviation industry has a huge potential for developing the country's economy, saying "aircraft has the potential to change our lives.
These are socio-economic benefits, but everything comes from the security and protection we have managed to achieve."

Trump nominates Peter Gaynor as Head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, who serves as the Administrator of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA), smiles at the meeting of the Senate National Budget Security Sub-Commission on the proposal of the FEMA for the financial year 2020 at the Capitol Summit in Washington, U.S.A., on 3 April 2019.
WASZYNGTON (Reuters) – White House announced that on Thursday US President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gaynor as head of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor, the FEMA administrator, is the head of the agency that oversees the government response to such disasters as hurricanes or forest fires.
The agency worked without an administrator approved by the American Senate since March when Brock Long dismissed that position.
Long resigned after the US Department of National Security under FEMA found that Long was improperly using government vehicles to travel between Washington and his home in the North Carolina.
Another candidate for this position, Jeffrey Byard, was expelled earlier this month when his exact examination of the past revealed the charges that he had taken part in the fight at the bar.
Gaynor's nomination was expected.
To confirm his appointment to this role, the majority of the Senate will be required.
The White House announced that prior to becoming the FEMA administrator in 2018, Gaynor worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in the seabed.
Henrik Ingebrichtsen, Norwegian runner, considering amputation of the thumb
The 28-year-old runner specializes in the distance of 1500 meters, winning the gold medal of the European Championships in 2012 (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and brown in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also a European champion for 5,000 metres from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that this is not a new relief and that there has already been one operation immediately after the games in 2016, but the pain has returned and the current season has been very violent.
Pain causes me to put a different footing, which in turn changes my body’s system, causes other unnatural burdens, and begins to feel pain in other places, such as biodegradation.
That's why I couldn't prepare enough for the world's championships, and the pain has been so strong for two weeks that I'm having trouble putting my wheels on – the runner said on the NRK TV channel.
The father and coach of the Žert Ingebrichtsen admitted that after a long discussion with his son, the only solution to stop his career and participate in the future Olympics in Tokyo would be amputation.
It looks like it's the only one, although the drastic solution and decision have already come down.
"If a part of the body hurts, it should be removed, and in total Henrik it does not need this finger so much and in this situation it should be forgotten about a cosmetic aspect," he explained.
Police close illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday the police closed the illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley.
At the office building standing on the 9600 Telstar Avenue street around 16:37 there was a raid, where the police were looking for illegal products for the sale of e-papers containing marijuana and where large layers containing butane hash oil were found, a concentrate of Indian mushrooms.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police, officers also found a device that was used to supplement the combustion deposits.
"This process is very dangerous," says Cano.
Cano, who used to work with drugs, says that the distillation of oil used in vaping products is a potentially easy process.
“A normal electrostatic spark of our clothes can cause the ignition of these gears, causing not only fire, but also explosions due to concentration,” he says.
“If we have many layers and similar in the room, after one explosion there will be another, causing not only fire, but also explosions that could get out of the surface of the entire complex.
A team was invited to the office for special tasks to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
Currently, the value of confiscated products and equipment is unknown.
The detectives say they received an anonymous guide that allowed them to obtain a search warrant, which led to the discovery of illegal activity.
The investigators are still trying to get information about who's behind this illegal business.
According to them, the person in charge was interested in this place because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing, and officials want to be sure that illegal products have not reached the street, taking into account recent articles on the dangers of steaming.
"People really don't know what products they buy," says Cano.
‘They may be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This may pose a threat to our society and children, so we always keep them from reaching for this kind of thing.
Aphtin's off the market.
GIF has made a decision to use the medicine for blisters
The Chief Inspectorate of Pharmaceuticals informed of the withdrawal of the medicinal product from the market for oral infections.
Aphtin is a medicine that is used to treat mucous membrane mucous membranes of the mouth, infections with Gram-addition bacteria.
It can also be used to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The product was withdrawn because it did not comply with the requirements for the specification of the quality of the flavour and the decrease in the active substance content.
The product was withdrawn on request from the Galenium Laboratory in Olsztina.
Each month the GIF shall issue on average several decisions to withdraw the individual series of products from the market.
A series of medicinal products on the market in Poland may be re-introduced after the presentation of evidence of safety reasons for its use.
If you remove the medicine, you will not be able to do so.
Banknote 19 zł – where to buy a collection banknote about this nominal?
He's wearing 19 gold and he's wearing a picture of Ignac Jan Padrewski.
At the beginning of October, a new collection note will be introduced – the National Bank of Poland informed.
This is another banknote from the "Inelevacy" series.
He's supposed to remember the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Polish Securities Manufacturer.
As stated in the NBP Communication, Ignacy Jan Padrewski will be presented on the banknote.
Date placed on the banknote, 25 January 2019, is the day on which the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the PWPW belongs.
Also the nominal value, 19 zł, relates to the year of creation" - we read in the NBP Communication.
The watermark presents an image of the eagle from the first Polish banknote produced in PWPW after recovery of independence.
The novelty is a holographic bar located on the floor window.
The front page presents the portrait of Ignace Jan Padrewski, and a picture of Orla Biało's order was presented in addition to the inscription "not subject".
This letter, reflected in the manuscript by Joseph Pilsudski, is a 100-year-old trade logo for the return of independence by Poland.
In the coat of arms, symbolizing brotherhood and victory, the security developed by PWPW - Umbra4Note, which is a special form of angle effect, was composed.
On the reverse banknote page, the image of Gmach The manufacturer on the background of the contemporary Warsaw panoramas is placed.
Next to it is built into the PWPW logo, the SPARC Live security and the opalescent bar, also visible in UV light as repeat numbers "19" and the short "NBP" - describes NBP.
The banknote is due to go into circulation on October 2nd to load up to 55,000 pieces.
One note will cost 80 gold.
All currencies and banknotes issued by NBP, including those from special series, are the legal means of payment in Poland.
However, their nominal value is significantly higher than that which can be achieved on the collective market.
The new owner bought it for 500 thousand dollars, over two million gold, for his parents and decided to move the building to Queenstown in Maryland.
The house was transferred on a special platform to Easton port where it was loaded on a boat.
That's where he crossed the river 50 miles away.
Jarosław Kaczyński votes for Mågorzat Gosiewski
President PiS Jarosław Kaczyński will vote in the upcoming elections to Mågorzat Gosiewski.
"Please do the same," he appealed.
Jarosław Kaczyński and Malgorzat Gosijewska were invited to take pictures of the flag candidate PiS.
On Friday, the Warsaw "three" praised in the social media that it is receiving Kaczyn's vote in the parliamentary elections.
"The President of Law and Justice Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński supports Malgorzata Gosiewska," we read on her Facebook profile.
The party leader pointed out that he is sensitive, sensitive and always willing to help.
"I will give my vote to the Målgorzat Gosijevska and please do the same," he appealed.
Gosijevska is running for Sejm from district 19. (Warszawa) and third place on the list.
"One" is there itself Kaczynski, and the second takes over Mariusz Kaminski.
They're coming up with the bookstores.
Before we meet with popular writers and books at exceptional prices.
"We're here to break stereotypes.
The people of Podcarpacia are said to be not reading books.
We'll show that it's different," she said at a press conference, Marta Polttorak.
And who will support reading in Reese this year?
As we have heard, Sister Anastasia, who was called the first chef of the Rzecipospolit, will appear at the fairs, as well as Lukasz Orbitowski, Katarzyna Bonda, Karolina Korwin-Piotrowska and Jakub Čwiek.
This autumn in the Millennium Hall will be a great cultural event – November 22 and 23 at the shopping center, the 3rd edition of the Christmas Book Stores, one of the most important reading events in the region.
The most interesting publishers and bookmakers from all over Poland will come to the market.
There will be 30 of them, and among them there will be now, Mark, SQN, PWN and Black.
In their positions, they present their wide range of publishing offers and hundreds of book news that market participants will be able to buy at attractive prices.
More than that, special meetings with writers will be held during the two days of the auction.
This time the authors were invited to write about important matters and are not afraid to take difficult topics, and they are also award-winning winners and... they're doing great cooking.
The list of invited authors is not yet closed.
At that time, participants in the trades confirmed, among others, Lukasz Orbitowski – the winner of the political passport, Janusz Leon Wiszniewski, the best-selling author of the "Immediateness in the Network", and the king himself of the Polish criminal: Katarzyna Bonda.
The star of this year’s auction will be Anastasia’s sister, author of several hundred books (including cooks), which sold more than 4 million copies.
Exhibition of Lost Dress Elżbiety I in the Hampton Court Palace
The silver thread made of the most important silky camel has been artificially decorated with herbaceous, animal, and motyl bearings.
For Eleri Lynn, curator of the Historic Royal Palaces Foundation, this meant only one thing.
The desolating cloth hanging from 100 years on the wall of the small parish church that she was looking at could only be lost by a part of the garments of Elizabeth I.
Three years after Lynn went on a case on the exhibit of altar cloth in Bacton in the county of Herefordshire, the missing dress of Elżbiety is due to go to the exhibition next month in the Hampton Court Palace, near the same premises where the Queen of the Tudor dynasty could wear it over 450 years ago.
The extent of this discovery is that from the entire collection of royal dress only one element of the XVI-century dress survived.
Although there is no evidence that Elizabeth ever wore this dress, three years of research have strengthened the experts to believe that she must have been part of the royal wardrobe.
"Srebroglav" was legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtuoso quality of refined plants and flowers, later enriched with deer, dogs, mottles, fish and bears, indicates that the cover was one of the most important of the people.
The dress, when it was heard, could cost the equivalent of Tudor's possession.
“More than that, in the 1990s, when Elizabeth was ruled, she felt the threat from other women in the court and would not tolerate rivals wearing such manufactured fabrics,” says Lynn.
"As this is a very important statement, I have asked many people from the environment to look at the dress.
I was really glad to see the dress, and they also admired it and were practically convinced that we had a royal wardrobe in front of us.
Long, re-lived dress, trimmed to serve as an altar cloth in the dark church of St. Faith in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is the settlement from which Blanche Parry came, the closest Elizabeth to the court lady who has served the queen for her entire life and with which in local legends the spoken cloth was identified.
Although the dress arose after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elżbieta had to give her to the Parry family or paraphia to Blanche's memory before her death in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of conservatory work, four of which flowed on the most delicate hand-circuit using specially colored soap and dark surgical needles, the altar cloth hits the exhibition next to the exhibition's Hatfield House portrait "Rainbow Portrait", one of the most famous contemporary images representing Elżbiteta dressed in a similar dress.
"In the course of the work with historical fabrics, the art of the people who did it is really being respected," says Libby Thompson, chief of the conservation work, whose most of it was done in the glass field in the Hampton Court Palace, the only place large enough to accommodate some of the priceless palace gobelins.
“Looking back and forth, I began to feel immense respect for those who made it.
I've never worked on anything so elite.
The exhibition "The Lost Dress of Elizabeth" will begin on October 12 in the Hampton Court Palace
Fitch Agency confirmed Poland's rating with a stable perspective
Fitch confirmed Poland’s long-term rating in foreign currency on Friday at the level of “A-” – given in the Communication.
The prospects for the rating remained stable.
"The Fitch Agency points to strong macroeconomic and well-diversified economies, which are supported by sound economic policies and a strong banking sector," we read in the Communication of the Ministry of Finance.
As added, Fitch pointed out that Poland was at the peak of the economic cycle, and in 2019-2021 the real growth rate of the Gross National Product in Poland will be 4.1 per cent, 3.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively.
The Agency predicts that the level of government and self-government deficit to GDP in the years 2020-2021 will remain below the threshold of 3 per cent, 2.3 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively.
"The government and self-government debt ratio to GDP in 2019 will be 50.5 per cent according to the agency, and in subsequent years it will be smaller (average 48.3 per cent over the period 2020-2021)", we read.
Rating Polish
The summer round of Poland's rating reviews will end on October 11th S&P and Moody's.
The rating of Poland in Fitch's evaluation remains the same as it was issued at the end of March 2019.
At that time, the agency confirmed Poland's rating at the level of "A-" with a stable perspective.
Among the three largest credit rating agencies, Poland assesses the highest creditworthiness of Moody's – at the level of "A2".
Rating Poland according to Fitch and S&P is "A-", one level below Moody's.
The prospects of all assessments are stable.
What's a rating?
Credit rating agencies are set up to assist investors in assessing the risk scale of their investment activities.
The rating is granted to companies, banks and states.
In the latter case, each assessment shall be translated into economic attractiveness.
Rating is nothing but a credit rating.
It makes decisions about who and how much money to borrow.
Sometimes this information also suggests that the best thing to do is give no credit because there is a high risk that money will not be recovered.
The lower rating is associated with a higher risk.
In turn, higher risk is high interest on credit.
Each assessment must be justified and legitimized.
The rating can be manipulated, but in such a case, the agencies risk losing their reputation.
At the moment, more than 90 per cent of the world market for credit rating services are controlled by three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them uses its own system of assessments.
"Fifth of the Confederation": First 1000 plus
"Fifth of the Confederation", that is, the main foundations of the electoral programme, were presented in Koszalin on Friday to the Sejm district 40 applicants for a mandate from the KW Confederation Freedom and Independence list.
The leader of the Kosovo letter to Sejm Krzysztof Chmeelewski presented the words "five confederations".
"After the first 1000 plus programme for Poland, after the second fast and fair courts, after the third cultural and educational bonus, after the fourth national security, this is a healthy life," Chmelevski said.
He noted that "polices must finally start making good profits", so the Confederation wants to eliminate the income tax and, as Chmielewski said, "the problem with the tax-free amount itself will be solved".
"Poland needs to make a choice where they want to save their money for retirement, that is zero PIT and Voluntary ZUS for all," said the leader of the list on the "1000 plus programme for Poland".
However, Alexander Zadenck, starting from the second place of the list, said that "life is increasingly worse" and to change it, "support Polish farmers, Polish agriculture" should act for the cultivation of GMOs.
As she said, the Confederation is also talking about the end of the "stigmatization of seed mushrooms".
Zadencka declared the Confederation's support for the "development of a building using natural raw materials".
It was also mentioned on behalf of its group for "good vaccinations".
"The right to informed consent cannot be violated," she added.
The other candidates to the Sejm from the Kosalin County stressed that the Confederation was "a step forward in the process of bringing about a deep judicial reform", which would include, among other things, a review of the case by the judge "day after day".
They also claimed that the education grant would be granted to schools without the means of government, i.e., in their view, without additional costs related to the maintenance of officials.
The Confederation is also a "strong Polish army based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers".
The Sejm candidates stressed the need to increase the army.
According to them, there is also a need for easier access to weapons.
In economic matters, they stressed the need for "permanent access to energy".
"We can fire coal, we have a lot of geothermal energy, we also need to consider the return to the concept of nuclear power," said the fifth on the electoral list Piotr Karpinski.
Mexican cartel chief behind one third of the drugs in the United States
Chicago – just after sunrise on the West Side in Chicago CBS News reported an early drug addiction.
Brian McKnight from the DEA showed in full light what's going on.
Last year, nearly 800 people died from drug overdose in Chicago.
McKnight said "probably 90%" of Chicago drugs come from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug lord Nemesio Cervantesie, known as El Mencho.
"This is the most important priority for the DEA and directly for the federal executive bodies in the United States," said Matthew Donahue, chief DEA agent in Mexico.
The reward for El Mencho is $10 million.
He helped discover dozens of El Mencho drug labs in the jungle.
It belongs to El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Genéración, CJNG, who is responsible for at least one third of the drugs coming to the US via land and sea.
According to the Department of Justice, the cartel has mixed "tonnes" of cocaine, methamphetamines and heroin contaminated with fentanyl.
El Mencho's head is waiting for a $10 million reward.
As ironically, he lived in California about 30 years ago, where he was arrested for drug-related charges and eventually deported to Mexico.
That's where he created a brutal cartel.
It has a huge amount of weapons, RPG, a 50-caliber weapon.
It essentially has its own SWAT teams," Donahue added.
El Mencho protects his empire by using measures such as shooting a Mexican army helicopter, killing six people, or participating in public hanging this year.
In recent years, the brutality of the cartel has led to thousands of murders.
According to the statistics of the Mexican government, about 94 murders occur every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they cannot be handled without protective equipment.
In the cocaine pack laboratory, it is called the marker.
More than one third of them lead to the El Mencho cartel.
"He is responsible for sending the poison that kills innocent women and children," said Donahue.
So when someone dies a child, Donahue believes there is a "great chance" that drugs come from the El Mencho organization.
Over 67,000 Americans died last year from overdose.
France: 27-year-old blackmailed French president and his wife
The 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macron and the first lady – says the French prosecutor.
The accused shall ensure that he has documents compromising the presidential couple.
He asked the chief of state, among other things, 300 thousand euros in cash.
The man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work in France in the police says he received "explosive" documents from the person employed in the Elise Palace.
During the hearings, he explained that these documents not only compromise the presidential couple, but that their disclosure could be a threat to the security of Macron and the first lady of France.
In exchange for their return, he demanded 300 thousand euros – he also wanted to get a flat in Paris.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macron's daughters in the previous marriage.
According to the prosecutor, he refused to report to the police the documents he was talking about.
He said he'd pass them through – but we don't know if these documents really exist at the moment.
They weren't found during the audit at this 27-year-old's apartment.
The man was subjected to psychiatric tests, but the doctors did not find any serious disturbances in him.
PS4 game will be old school – Sony's amazing facts about PlayStation 4
Sony sheds more light on the fast-tracking game available only on PS4 The Last of Us: Part Two.
Sony in the recent State of Play presentation announced that the Sequelu premiere The Last of Us will take place in February 2020.
Fani could also see a new breath-stopping fragment in the chest playing from the next action game.
More concretes appeared in the days after the loud premiere of the play The Last of Us 2.
And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog are reaching out for high school climates in many ways.
Decided for something we haven't seen since the times of PS 1. The Last of Us: Part 2 will be sold on several plates.
Neil Druckmann of Naughty Dog confirmed this in a revolving interview with The Telegraph, explaining that the sequel has grown into one of the most extensive games in history.
"The plant is ambitious and has gone on in aspects where it was not the only one," he said.
It had to be so extensive that I could present this kind of story with so many characters.
We didn't mean to create the most extensive game, so it just happened.
“We are excited about how many possibilities are hidden in this story. There will be a moment when you think you’re going to the end, but you realize that it’s just the beginning and that the whole new chapter is beginning,” says Drutmann.
It's such an ambitious game that she's not on one BluRay and she's on two tracks.
In another place it was revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two epochs of adult content (information provided by Gamestpot).
We won't be pranking surprises, but appearing in the East Eggi game they're calling for the old school works of Naughty Dog.
You will find out more when The Last of Us: Part Two will debut on 21 February 2020 only on PS4.
People with PS4 can prepare for the sequel premiere, reaching for The Last of Us Remastered available in the PS Plus offer.
Sony recently announced a list of free PS4 games offered since October 2019 by PlayStation Plus, among which is the production of Naughty Dog.
PS Plus subscribers will also have access to the MLB The Show 19.
If you like The Last of Us Remastered and you want to put the pre-premier order on sequel, Sony has given that there will be many versions of the game, including an exclusive edition containing a replica of the back of Elly and her bracelets and a 30-centimeter figure of this cult shape.
Run, scrap and fight - Sport
On Saturday, Stomil takes Podbeskide and is willing to win.
Stomila's dancers from three colleges are unsatisfied.
At the time, the Zajeszkowski’s followers won seven points because they won with Stalla Mielec and Chojniczanka Chojnice, and in the last match, a no-brained regis fell in Suwalkak.
Now the Olympic team will take Podbeskide on Saturday at 6:00 p.m., which is listed as one of the favorites to advance to the Extraclass.
The closest Stomilla rivals occupy the fourth place in the table and have the advantage over the Olsztina team.
The podbeskid on the trips this season played six times and counted after two victories, remissions and defeats Natomiast Stomil feels very well at his facility – at the stadium near the Al. Pilsudska 69a team Peter Ząžozkowskiski won three times and lost once.
Together, in ten rows, the ossification gathered 17 points and were in the head of the table, although after two failures at the beginning of the game did not say anything.
"Any change takes time to be a result," explains Piotr Skiba.
"Well, finally, we got something to do, we believed in ourselves, and we could work under normal conditions.
We just got together for the ball.
They're clean heads, they're a good atmosphere and everyone knows what to do because we have a strong training staff."
On Tuesday, Stomila’s dancers were eliminated from the Polish Choraz Movement, but they needed to do it as well as a series of criminal shootings.
In southern Poland, Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not leave, because coach Zązkowski had given these key fighters a break before Saturday with Podbeskid.
On the other hand, in Croatia, he played back after the conjugation of Jakub Mosakowski, who finally shot his long-awaited gate.
“It’s always fun to get a goal, and I’ve come at a time so that we can continue to play the drums (Moscow was equal to 3:3 in 119 minutes – reg.).
Dad often bit me and laughed that I couldn't get the gates, and I always told him I'd shoot at a time when he wouldn't expect to."
Now, Moscow is counting on the return to the basic composition, more than the fact that the yellow cards cannot play Oleh Tarasenko.
"After this, I get into practice so I can play first," says Moscow.
"I did my best to present myself in Chorzow.
But whether I'm gonna play or sit on the spare benches, I'm gonna support the team in the same way.
Because the most important is the team and three points in the game with Podbeskide.
We are sure to have a difficult meeting, in which victory will have to run, scatter and fight."
In the middle of the Olsztian defense, Rafał Remisz can still play, who has recently also become angry, so we'll find out if it's on Saturday, more than that Ząšzkowski's coach traditionally tries to keep himself in the dark until the end of the strike.
The man raped and murdered his sister.
"You will never see the light of day.
You'll never breathe fresh air again," said Judge Kevin K. Allen, addressing Alex Whipple.
"What you did was so reprehensible and dirty that you have to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
Five-year-old Lizzie disappeared in May.
Her search lasted five days until Whipple pointed out where the body was hiding.
"How could anyone do this to his own sister?" asked Dejay Smith, a girl's uncle.
"You are the worst person humanity has to offer," Alexa Whipple said.
"I would give up everything to meet her again, hug her," said the murdered girl's mother.
"Our life will never be the same again," added the contrite woman.
As Fox News reports, 22-year-old Whipple didn't show any emotion during the interview.
Last month, he admitted to stealing, using sex, and murdering a girl.
The man's lawyer said his client was raised in "an imperfect family".
He was supposed to be harassed as a child.
He also added that Whipple is aware that he has committed a terrible act and is ready to take the punishment.
The man was sentenced to life without the possibility of seeking parole.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that he would hand over nearly $100 million additional funds to the affected communities.
The programme providing money to farmers affected by droughts will be extended and the criteria for the allocation of additives to farms will be simplified.
The aid package covers nearly $34 million in support for the affected communities, thus enabling eligible farmers to receive up to $3,000 in emergency cases.
Each of the 13 local self-government areas under the drought relief programme will receive up to $1 million in infrastructure and disaster relief.
The new support package is an addendum to over $7 billion allocated by the government to the drought-fighting fund.

In the Name of Love China's Masters Busters
documentary film: In China, the number of divorces has increased twice in the last decade.
The reason for this state of affairs was generally the third person.
More and more men maintain extramarital relations, leading to the formation of a particular industry in the country – a professional gathering of lovers who are intended to save the marriages of betrayed women.
Let's shout out loud: Ma-te-usz!
An attempt to welcome the Prime Minister in Pekara Słуски
A special general test was carried out before the election with Prime Minister Matthew Morawieck in Słуски.
"Dear state, louder, louder, so we do not welcome the Prime Minister here!
Let's shout out loud: Ma-te-usz!", encouraged the performers.
Unfortunately, the enthusiastic efforts of the leadership did not produce the expected result.
The campaign is on the move.
Politicians are driving all over the country, convincing the voters.
An intensive campaign is also run by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who is a frequent guest in the region as a leader of the Silesian PiS.
Each meeting is precisely planned, including the appropriate repair.
It was also, rather, to be, in the Slovene Squares.
A special guest should be welcomed.
Prior to the meeting with the Prime Minister, he decided to conduct a general trial in the Chamber.
There's nothing intruder was trying to encourage the crowd to question the name of the government chief.
"This will not be a greeting to me, only to Prime Minister Matthew Morawiecki!
Also louder, louder than my dear!", he encouraged disillusioned.
Unfortunately, the crowd was not able to take full advantage of the hot moods of the leader and was reluctant to respond to Ma-te-usz, but the recording of the enthusiastic leadership makes a furor on the network.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A man convicted of murdering his former wife in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was sentenced to the 2014 murder of Stephen and Katie Stay and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
According to the authorities, he entered the house of the state on 9 July 2014, requesting the disclosure of his wife's residence, Melannie Haskell, with whom he was in separation.
She wasn't there, but she was her sister, Katie Stay and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys aged 13 and 4, and two girls aged 9 and 7, died when Haskell opened fire, as Harris's Sheriff's Office says.
Only one family member survived, 15-year-old Cassidy Stay.
The authorities claimed that she was badly injured, but she managed to heal completely.
On Thursday, members of the jury rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on the basis of illiteracy.
The left of the sworn ones will be gathered again on Monday to give the verdict.
The quantum Internet is closer and closer to reality – ScienceDaily
The U.S. Army's research results move quantum internet closer.
Such internets could offer military security, detection and accuracy of the lack of time available in a traditional network approach.
The Centre for the Comprehensive Quantum Processing of Military Information Research Laboratory for the Development of the U.S. Army Operational Opportunity has been looking at researchers from the University of Insbruck, which has managed to achieve a record transfer of the state between the material and the light – at a distance of 50 kilometres using light cables.
Splitting is a correlation that can occur between quanta such as cubes.
When two cubes are split and one of them is measured, it will affect the measurement of the other one, even if the other cube is physically distant.
"These [50 kilometres] are two rows of sizes beyond the previous possible and it is a remote to the start of the construction of the quantum interurban networks," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, an experimental physicist at the University of Innsbruck and the main researcher in the project, whose discovery was published in the Nature magazine, the Quantum Information section.
Quantum networks would consist of distant bonds of physical cubes that are intertwined with each other despite a large physical distance.
Researchers have found that the spread of the flat state is necessary for the creation of the quantum internet.
"This demonstration is a slow step forward to achieve a large-scale widespread state," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-chairing the military programme supporting these research.
The quality of the flat state at the second end of the lighthouse is also high enough to meet some of the most difficult applications of quantum networks.
The research team started an experiment with the calcium atom trapped in the ion capture.
Using laser bonds, researchers entered quantum status in jon while stimulating it to emit a photon in which quantum information was recorded.
As a result, the quantum state of the atom and the particles of the light have been crushed.
The challenge is to send photos to a light-emitting cable.
"The photon emitted by ion of calcium has a length of 854 nanometers and is quickly absorbed by the lighthouse," Lanyon said.
That is why his team initially sent a piece of light through a nonlinear crystal lit by a powerful laser beam.
The length of the photon wave was converted to the optimal value from the point of view of the transmission to a long distance – the current standard telecommunications wavelength of the wave is 1550 nanometers.
The researchers then sent this photon through a 50-kilometre light-emitting cable.
Their measurements show that the atoms and particles of the light were still smeared even after the wavelength of the wave and the passage of that distance.
"The decision on the choice of calcium means that this result leads directly to the creation of a broken network of atomic clocks at large physical distances, as the calcium can be combined with a high quality cube of "magic".
The army is very much interested in multi-scale networked clocks due to the application of precise positioning, precise navigation and time synchronisation," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher, who also co-operates with the program.
