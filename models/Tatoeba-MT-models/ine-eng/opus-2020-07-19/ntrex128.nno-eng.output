Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid not to be taken seriously
Several members of the national assembly were recently offended by a proposal to change the names of the members of the assembly or AM (congregation member) to a member of the Wallisian Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The response was due to plans to change the name of the national assembly to the Wallisian Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they can be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour said his group is concerned about your "MWP Rims on Twp and Pwp"
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, 'twp' means dull and 'pwp' bosj.
A member of the Plaid party said that the group 'is not naked' and has proposed options.
A Welsh Conservative member said that his group has an "open mind" when it applies to the name change, but let MWP not be far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the walisk letter w is not expressed differently the English Yorkshire dialect's statement of the letter u.
The National Assembly, which now writes a legislative proposal to introduce the name change, said: ‘The final decision on which members of the National Assembly will, of course, be made to members of themselves.’
A Wallisic official decided since 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the name proposals that showed great support for calling the Wallisian Parliament.
In the case of the title of members of the national assembly, the delegation preferred the Walysian member or WMP, while the MWP option was most supported under the public hearing.
Members of the National Assembly have a certain mark on other proposals, but the struggle to be certain has given the leader of the delegation, Elin Jones, the main work, to submit the bill in a few weeks.
The legal basis for the reforms includes other changes to the functioning of the delegation, including rules on disqualification of assembly members and the design of a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will be able to vote on what they should be called when they are discussing the bill.
Make-up noises in public opinion to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters shall vote in favour of whether to change the name of their country to «the Republic of North Macedonia».
The referendum was designed to resolve a conflict that has been taking place for decades with the neighboring country of Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a requirement on the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia's EU and NATO membership requests.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of popular opinion on the change of names, said that he was coming to see the outcome.
Those who support public integration, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the right and the wrong price for becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin stand still while the churches in Harlem, New York, strive
"The old I have spoken to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Adams.
«Today none of the parts are present».
He said he understood why the bar disappeared.
"People are socializing in other ways now," he said.
"Bars are no longer substances in the neighborhood that people normally visit."
When it comes to the churches, he is concerned that the money from selling property does not last as long as the layers believe, "and before or since they are back where they started."
He added that churches could be replaced by interest rates filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historic places in the neighborhood.
“Most of those who buy shareholdings in these buildings are white,” he said. “and this is the day when all the churches are closed, because it is not likely that these people who move into the shareholdings will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white shoe before Harlem became a black town - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin church a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black shoe that had been announced in the vicinity, moved into the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by a black sock leia of pastor John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott of the shops in 125th Street, a chief delegate in Harlem where the owners were opposed to attaching or promoting black.
The building suffered great damage in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson’s followers planned to build him again, they also ordered a new clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson senior and follower of St. Martin, was proud and called the clock “the hours of the poor.”
The expert who played the game in July calls it something else: «A cultural tax» and «a historical instrument which cannot be replaced».
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first time in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left the church to play the larger clock in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that St. Martin did not find a substitute for him.
What has happened in Santt Martin in recent months has become a complicated story about architects and construction workers, some of them added by the leaders of the playwrights in the church, and others of the episcopal bishop.
The Sacristy, who is the founder of the so-called so-called Leys, wrote to the Bishop in July with concern that the Bishops 'will ask the Sacristy to pay', even though the Sacristy was not involved in the Bishop's addition of architects and construction workers.
Some members of the sock have complained about the lack of openness from the epithet.
13-year-old shark damage in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while he dived into lobsters in California on the opening day of the Hummar season.
The attack was just before 7:00 in the morning near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented on the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends in about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard that the boy called for help.
Hammel said that first he thought only the boy was curious to have caught a lobster, before he realized that the boy cried out "What beat me!
Something bites me!"
"His whole neck was torn off," Hammel said he observed when he reached the boy.
"I cried that everyone should come out of the water. There is a shark in the water."
The goods were taken from air ambulances and taken to the Council hospital for children in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
That's definitely what kind of shark it was that attacked the boy.
The bathroom captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the boy suffered serious damage to the upper body.
The quantities closed access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most are not threatened to be dangerous.
Sales chain Sainsbury's bets on beauty product
The British store chain Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenham's beauty product and offer wholesale services in the store.
As part of an investment in the UK's beauty market, worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow as the fashion and interior halls go down, Sainsbury's beauty products will be tested in 11 shops next year, and more shops will be successful.
The investment in beauty product comes at a time when the shelves that used to be filled with TVs, microwaves and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said they have to double the number of beauty products for 3000 products and offer brand Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They must give the marks L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand as in the Boots stores.
The shop must also relaunch its own Boutique jewelry series and make most of the products vegan, something to attract more young customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test its perfumes room in two of Sainsbury's shops. The first opened in Croydon, London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online action and a change against buying small quantities of food every day from local retail stores means that large stores need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, the manager of Sainsbury's, has commented that stores will look more and more like a store store, while stores are trying to fight the low-priced Aldi and Lidl stores with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has joined the Argos interior chain in hundreds of shops and introduced several Habitat stores, as they purchased both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims this has increased the food supply and thus defended the purchase.
The store chain's previous attempt to renew beauty and pharmacy departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's cooperation with Boots early in the 2000s, but this ended when the parties did not know how to share the profits from the pharmacy in the stores.
The new strategy follows the sale of Sainsbury's pharmacology chain Celesio, which had 281 pharmacology and Lloyd's own pharmacology chain, for £125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and should offer an extended luxury series of skin products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have changed how the beauty hills will look and experience to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also added colleagues with special competence to offer beauty services.
Our product brands are designed to suit all needs, while the attractive environment and the practical locations mean that we are now an attractive destination of beauty that broadens the old way of acting."
Peter Jones "racing" after Holly Willohby moved from the deal value £11 million
The star from the Dragons TV program, Peter Jones, is "racing" after the TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out a deal with the life mark his worth £11 million to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to promote the interior and accessories of their True.
The couple's cooperation has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host from this Morning program, 37, introduced the latest Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the star from Dragons Den, Peter Jones, in the middle of the development of the new cooperation they are about a lifestyle brand to focus on their own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Source reports that Jones was "racing" when the golden Holly attended an intensive meeting on Tuesday in the headquarters of Jones' business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts -- worth up to £1.5 million -- mean that she no longer has time to cooperate on the interior and accessories brand True.
The cooperation has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was supposed to double its estimated worth of £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make it known that she was not to work with True, while Jones had escaped the United Kingdom to rest in one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was absolutely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term plan for the future and would last for many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised all involved.
No one threatened his own ears on Tuesday, True was so near the launch.
There is a warehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale.’
Experts believe that deciding on this Morning host, which is one of the richest stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company millions because of heavy investments in product, from putters to candlelights to clothing and interiors, and can cause delays in launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is mother to three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, has our close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the brand True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as the board member in March.
Para holidays together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as a host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones last night said, "We don't comment on his business."
Buckle up calls "and we love each other."
He paid for the criticism he came from the media to come up with a comment that some could experience as "unpredental" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
You said Trump with his Customs Voice as "Newness Reader".
"I haven't given up anything."
He commented that Kim was interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the decommissioning of the nuclear programme in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the nuclear programme have stopped.
More than three months after the June-June meeting in Singapore, the North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not receive a "response" from the United States regarding the early destruction of North Korea.
Instead, he added, continued the United States with sanctions to press North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"It's great between us and North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He added that his work to improve relationships with Kim has brought positive results -- the end of rocket testing, help to release hostages and the return of the lives of American soldiers.
He defended his unusual procedure when it came to his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing to the group that stood in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy the island and kill hundreds of people
After the Lombo earthquake, foreign aid organisations reported that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 per cent of the inhabitants of Lombok had to flee, none declared a national crisis state, which is necessary for international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear that they do not want international help, so it is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
While Redd Children set up a team to travel to Palu, it is still not safe to add a foreign passport to the field.
Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Crisis Agency in Indonesia, said that the authorities are assessing the situation in Palu in order to see if international organisations are allowed to offer aid.
Although Indonesia is often exposed to earthquakes, the country is not particularly vulnerable to natural forces.
In the Aceh area, they have built space for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite warnings against tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, something most likely led to several victims.
Traveling between Indonesian eyes is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat those who were injured in the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving the infrastructure in Indonesia during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for the administration of President Joko, and the next year there is another choice.
President Joko will also be pressed when the debt of sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have welcomed his conservative threat.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee when Christians and Muslims were fighting in the streets and used machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.

Parliament status of Cromwell will be the last victim of the "rewriting of history"
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England that his Puritan followers did during the 1600s.
But the Cromwell Association describes Crick's proposal to remove the statue as "putting" and "a attempt to write about history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of the statutes, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would become a goal.
The iconoclass during the English Civil War was strictly ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the deeds of his forefather, Thomas, centuries ago.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's outstanding representation of Cromwell is evidence of public opinion in the 1800s, and is part of the history of a figure that many still think is worth celebrating."
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the 1800s, and is still today, seen as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was of course against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or one, there is still a topic of discussion in the historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual that we knew represented one side of that division.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killing and killing Chinese peasants
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, following local media reports.
The man, named Yuan, was found dead, with cut wrists and cover with blood, near a pig tie on the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig bunny prepares to give pigs vaccines on a garden on May 30th, 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He had recently traveled with his aunt from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning he found the fatter his death, and discovered that the gate to one of the pigs' bins was open.
He said there was a big gown with blood around his mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250 kilos of heavy pig had killed the farm, according to the report.
"The bones to my fat were bloody and broken," said the fat, named Wu, to Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance camera shows that Yuan came to the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His appearance was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him, did not listen to Yuan or his fattened-up.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to prevent him from attacking others, while the police gathered evidence on the stand.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the market leader.
Although rare, such attacks have occurred in the past.
In 2016 a pig went to arrest a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, and seriously injured the man.
Ten years earlier, a 295-pound-thread pig caught a Walysian farmer between himself and a tractor, until his wife frightened the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon became food for his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News reported that pigs are not aggressive to the usual, but that the taste of blood can last.
«Dei will only play.
They like to bite a little bit, they're curious... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
The rest of the hurricane, Rosa, brings rain to the southwestern United States
As foretold in the weather report, the hurricane Rosa becomes weaker over the cool water along the northern coast of Mexico.
Even so, Rosa will have her peaches for North Mexico and South-West America in the next few days.
Rosa had wind strength up to 136 km/h and was an hurricane of category 1 until 05:00 in the outdoor time zone in the United States on Sunday, and the hurricane centre was 620 kilometers south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa has to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, there is a low pressure on the Pacific that moves east towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa comes closer to the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity north to the Southwest USA.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with low pressure and cause heavy rain in the south-west in the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous rivers and possible desert plains.
Tropical humidity will lead to rain between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of the South-West USA, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain are expected in parts of southwestern USA; especially over large parts of Arizona.
Hazardous floods can occur due to widespread terrain and tropical rain.
It is warned against trips in the desert of foot due to the danger of tropical rain.
The rain can turn the tides into flaming eels and lightning and galley towers will bring strong wind and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the southern coast of California.
The total rainfall of more than 1 centimeter is possible, something that can create small rivers and smooth roads.
This will be the first rainy town for the season in the region.
Spreading tropical rainy cities will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain rises late Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can expect a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October can witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic becomes colder, but tropical strikes will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There is almost 20 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, late summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
Many of the Central and Eastern USA are expected to experience a hot start in October, with 25 degrees and upwards from the southern part of the large plains to parts of the North-East USA.
New York City can reach 25 degrees per Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term warning indicates that there is a higher chance of average temperatures in the East-US through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people are looking at Brett Kavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people saw the testimony burden of Brett Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court and woman who owed him sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different TV channels.
At the same time, the political debate around the issue, with interruptions in the usual TV programmes of various broadcasters to reveal the latest news on Friday: a unity reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI should investigate the debts during the next week.
Ford told the Supreme Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh felt her when he was full and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during a sensory defamation, that he's 100 percent sure that's not her.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw the hearing on Friday, followed by Nielsen.
The company came to this number by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The number could not be retrieved from other channels that showed detachment, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting lakes looking at from the office.
To put this in perspective, there's a similar number of sailors looking at an American football final or Oscar distribution.
Fox News hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also with most lakes during the day with 5.69 million lakes, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place 3.26 million sailors.
CBS had 3.1 million lakes, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still interested in hearing.
Flake was in focus during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, who is a moderate Republican, declared that he is on the Kavanaugh side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while Protestants called after him on his way to a hearing with a court committee on Friday.
He stood in the ground for several minutes while the Protestants were beating him alive at CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you trust him to tell the truth to our country?"
Some said to him, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had spoken, and before he went into the elevator he said he would have more to say under committee hearings.
The broadcasting agency showed the voice on TV when the panel committee was supposed to speak for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to full Senate and further speaking.
But Flake said he could only do it if the FBI was investigating the claims against Kavanaugh over the next week, something the Democrats have also asked for.
Flake was partly overcome after talking to his friend, the democrat, and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake took a decision.
Flake’s determination was to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not resolve for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation of complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May owes critics to "balance policy" when applied to Brexit
The UK State Minister Theresa May owes the critics of her plans to leave the EU in order to "balance politics" with the future of the United Kingdom without regard to national interests, in an interview with The Sunday Times.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to participate in the Conservative Party's conference on 29 September 2018.
On the side of the May interview on the front of Sunday Times, an interview with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson is taking place on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and saying that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU collect their fees is "very absurd."
Wayde Sims Shooting in the United States: Police arrested the suspect Dyteon Simpson for Sims Shooting
Police arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned for deliberate murder, says the police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
The police found the glasses on the east and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, follow a report from the WAFB channel, which is connected to CBS.
After listening to Simpson, the police said he admitted to have shot Wayde.
Simpson's bail was set to $350 000, local advisor The Lawyers reports.
The coroner of the East Baton Rouge published an early autopsy report on Friday that showed that the cause of death was a shot in the head that went into the neck.
The Baton Rouge police support the Louisiana state police's special forces, the state police's crime lab, the South University police and local residents to help them find Simpson.
The athletic director at LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for being “awake to the achievement of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 meter high basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 flips per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "confessive" after Wayne was killed.
"Then there's something we're always afraid of," said Wade.
Volcanic ash out over Mexico City
Oske from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached southern parts of Mexico’s capital.
The national crisis prevention centre requests Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after the activity has increased in the crack and the centre recorded 183 gas and ozone emissions over 24 hours.
The center had observed several rumbles and shrieks.
Photos on social media show thin layers of oak on cars in different neighboring areas in Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, as an earthquake of 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as Don Goyo and has been active since 1994.
Politicians clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the self-defense.
Six demonstrators were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after self-defense demonstrators clashed with police forces, and thousands of other demonstrators protested against self-defense one year after the voice of any release from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while they threw eggs and powders that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Congested also broke out later on the day, and the police used batons to prevent escalation.
In several hours the separatists called "Don't forget, don't forgive" while the Protestants called against their own call, "Long live Spain."
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for minor damage after the protests.
The vote is still under pressure in the region and many will still have their own year after the 1st of October, which was called illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most of the voters were self-employed, but there was also low participation among those who were self-employed and boycotted.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the riots and electoral clashes in the region.
Groups who were too self-employed sleeping in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration went by the stack, however, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in separatist protests with a woman, said that he no longer has hope of self-esteem in Catalonia.
"We experienced one of our moments yesterday.
I saw my parents crying with joy to be able to speak for themselves, but now we're stuck again," he said.
Although they won the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties that are too self-sufficient to hold power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or in detention while awaiting their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of self-defence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was home to politicians on both sides.
"The tension increases more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders, declared that he was going to vote in the European Parliament next year.
"To remain as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the withdrawal of democratic values and the oppression we have experienced from the Spanish state," he said.
Londonderry, Northern Ireland: Men arrested to crash a car into a house with a will
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, have been arrested after crashing into a house several times in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 a.m. local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that the car caused damage to the entrance gate and to the building itself.
A bracelet may have been used to shoot against the car.
Menga-Skot gives Livingstone 1-0 victory over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Mending its first goal for Livingstone's heroes says
Awakening Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard, his second saying after 18 matches as a coach for the Ibrox club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot turned out to explain the difference while Gary Holt's side matched up with the hibernian in the other.
Gerard's side has no winner in the Scottish Premiership League this season, and shall play against Hearts, as they lay eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Ranger's true science for Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has six wins in line, and Chief Coach Holt hasn't lost since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against the remote deck
Hold your team would have rented long before they scored, and created more problems for Rangers with the direct play.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had a low effort towards goals, something that made Alan Lithgow have to work hard after the meeting with Craig Halkett his heading over the goal.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, well aware that they could create trouble for the remote team.
And that's how the decisive goal was to score.
Rangers went to a fresh park and Livingston created an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menga, who took a touch and score from the center of the criminal field.
Before that, Ranger's ball dominated, but he saw that the home defense was solid and the Keeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continues into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a target.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers' Keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow was far away after the ball was returned from Livingstone.
The fittings were sent back and forth in the Livingston criminal field, while two punishments--after Halket's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one for hands--were blown away.
Livingston's Phenomenal Analysis
BBC Scotland sin Alasdair Lamont and Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal struggle and a phenomenal outcome for Livingstone.
Each player has played fantastically and still impresses the curve up.
Their play and player style has barely changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks to it goes to Holt for the way he's shocked the team on the side he became a coach.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, and organized a defence at military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the fight.
Rangers were not motivated by the opposite.
Even as good as they have been under Gerrard, they were not good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and only cut up half of the house once, something that should get Rangers to realize they didn't get up anymore.
Erdogan gets mixed welcome in Cologne
The statesmen in Turkey and Germany smiled under the blue sky when they met to eat breakfast on Saturday, September 29th, Berlin.
It is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is hoped to repair relations between the two NATO countries.
The countries are not alone when it comes to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large, new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police prevented a population of over 25 000 from gathering in front of the mosque because of ‘security reasons’, but many of Erdogan’s supporters met to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of the Kurdish - also met to condemn Erdogan's policy and the German state decided to welcome him into the country.
The duplicating Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who looked at Erdogan as a whole, and others, who looked at him as a autocrat.
Car accident in Deptford, London: Cyclists died after car collision
A bicycle list has lost its life in a collision with a London car.
The collision near her crossed at Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a road in Deptford in southeastern London, at 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver stopped and the ambulance staff arrived quickly, but the man died on the east.
The collision took her only a few months after another cyclist died when the driver left on Childers Street, about six miles from today's accident.
The London police reported that they were about to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been closed and buses have to run around the area, while other drivers have been encouraged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison in England: Six guards damage in riot
Six prison guards have been injured in a riot in a high-security prison for men, says the England prison office.
The ongoing riot broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 local time on Sunday.
Special "Tornado" forces are collected to calm down the riot, involving eight prisoners in a separate part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for minor injuries in the face.
One jailer said: "Special rate guards must calm down the ongoing riot in the HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate elections in our prisons, and we are ready that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to sit in jail any longer."
There are more than 500 people in the HMP Long Lartin, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the United Kingdom.
In June, it was reported that the Director of Prison was treated for damage, after a prisoner went to arrest.
And in October yesterday, special forces had to come to prison to calm down a serious riot, where prisoners threw billions of bullets at the guards.
Orkanen Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flame (for the benefit of drought)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but it is just such a weather phenomenon that is on its way to Arizona early next week, in the rest of the hurricane Rosa moves south-west over the desert and creates fear of flame.
The National Weather Service has issued warnings against flame on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and south and east Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including the towns Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and can give rain already late Monday.
The national weather service in Phoenix tweets that only "Tie tropical cyclones have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 kilometres outside the Arizona border.’
The latest models from the national orchestra report between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
It may be between 2 and 5 centimeters in other areas of the South West, including central parts of Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated totals up to 10 centimeters.
For areas outside the flood risk, the Rosa can be a blessing in the drought.
Although flame is a serious concern, it is likely that this calculated profit area in the south-west US is exposed to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, the extreme drought is over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the next highest drought category, reports weather.com.
First, the giant Rosa comes to move across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
With wind over 135 kilometers per hour, Rosa is on Sunday morning 619 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north with a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm meets colder water in the Pacific and is resting down there.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storms, Monday afternoon or evening.
It's going to calculate a lot in parts of Mexico, something that can increase the risk of flame.
«The rain between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to Northwest Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 centimeters," weather.com reported.
Rosa will pull north along Mexico as a tropical storm before she reaches the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will pull up through Arizona and enter south-Utah Tuesday evening.
«The biggest danger with Rosa or the rest of it is very rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the American South West," said the National Orcano Centre.
This rain is expected to create life-threatening rivers in the desert and landscapes in the mountain area.
Action in Midsomer Norton, England: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are arrested, suspected of killing after a 16-year-old was found the knife in Somerset, England.
The teenage good was found damage in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two- 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested last night in the Radstock area, reports Avon and Somerset police.
The police have invited people who can have mobile recordings of what happened to get in touch.
Trump says Kavanaugh "Member" while the "sick and sin" Democrats were against him
"A voice for judges Kavanaugh is a voice against the noble and absurd tactics of the Democrats," said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has ‘ members’ during which the ‘sick and sin’ Democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave testimony in front of the congress on Thursday, and emotionally denied the guilt of Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her for several decades since they were teenagers.
Ford also gave evidence of her debts under the ring.
On Saturday, the President said that "the American people saw how brilliant and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
"A voice to Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to one of the most skilled lawyers in our time, a lawyer with no faulty service in the public," he told a number of followers in West Virginia.
The President also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of the Republicans in the US elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't stand, but I really do," he said.
“That’s why I travel around to fight for good candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats are outside after "stand up and block."
The first major vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh was expected to take place on Friday, a Republican representative told CNN.
Dogs killed in earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia, speak of killed aggravations
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them taken by huge waves on beaches, while a strong earthquake and a tsunami frame the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to participate in a festival at the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when the waves, which was six meters high, struck the beach at sunset, and took many people while they were destroying everything they had over.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the tsunami came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who didn’t take off once and thus became victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the crisis relief agency in Indonesia BNPB, in Jakarta.
"As if the tsunami wasn't enough in itself, he carried cars, tricycles, houses; he framed everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climb up into three to avoid the tsunami and survive in that way.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photo from the air published by the crisis agency shows many damaged buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
After that, the coastal town continued to be hit on Saturday.
Earthquake could be seen in the area around, with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia’s Agency for Testing and Testing Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy from the earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times stronger than the energy from the atomic bomb on Hiroshima during the second world war.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, the Agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘inclusive’ and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the deceased have been found during the rest of the collapse buildings, he said, and left 540 people injured and 29 still missing.
Nugroho said that the number of deaths and the size of the damage could be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is more epicentered to the cliff.
"We haven't heard anything from Dongåla, the communication is cut," Nugroho said.
‘More than 300,000 people live there,’ the Red Cross said, and their additions and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it may get much worse," said the Red Cross.
The crisis agency was criticised on Saturday not to inform that a tsunami had hit Palu, even if the authorities said that waves had arrived before the warning period.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man in the upper floor of a building who cries desperately to man down the streets to warn them against the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water was found on the coast, and it took buildings and cars.
Computers could not verify the video first.
The scarf and tsunami cause a power break and cut the communication around Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate emergency aid.
The military has launched the process of sending emergency cargo flights from Jakarta and other cities, reports the authorities, but the refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened to receive emergency aid, but will continue to be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in Indonesia exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
They have been added to World Vision from Dongalla to the city of Palu, and have been able to count in the backyard of their office. On the way to the city, the total area was crossed, said Doseba.
"They told me they saw many damaged houses," he said.
It's very bad.
While emergency relief organisations are starting their work to help those affected by tsunamis, some have complained that foreign emergency relief workers with crisis management expertise have been denied entry to Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian law, foreign aid organisations cannot be added and started until Indonesia has declared the area to be a national crisis zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"There is a crisis at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
‘When the State says ‘OK, this is a national crisis,’ we can open for international aid, but they have not updated the status yet.’
There is still evening in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those who are still lacking hope still on a miracle, but know that such natural catastrophes do not end well.
On Saturday a little good was saved from the clock.
On Sunday a woman was rescued from the rest of a collapsed building, where she had been caught by the dead mother for two days.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, thirty-two of the missing paragliders from the Asian games that were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man called Monday said that some of those who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As one with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to deal with," he said.
Gendon said he desperately sent whatsApp messages to the paragliders from Palu, who had participated in the local beach festival, after he heard that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only a grey hook, instead of two blue hooks.
"I think this means that the messages did not appear," he said.
Thieves set $26,750 from minibank in Newport, Levee, USA
On Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from a worker in Brink's company in what he was about to fill out a minibank in Newport, Levee, USA, followed a press release from the Newport police.
The worker had just emptied a minibank in the maintenance area and was about to deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While the worker was busy, "a man jumped up behind the worker" and stole a bag of money to deliver.
White observed several suspects as they escaped from the city, followed the press release, but the police could not determine the number of people involved in the raid.
If anyone has information about who was involved, they should call the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper renames Ye
The Rapper Kanye West changes name - to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, and wrote: "The creation was earlier known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had ye as a nickname for a while, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came right before he was to act on Saturday Night Live, where he was expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the show after she cancels because of the "emotional Causes," the programmer said.
In addition to being abbreviation of his current artist name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think the word "ye" is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
The name has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye-- to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are."
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with the West, has also changed the writing style of the name with and without strings and large letters.
Mexico's future president promises not to send the military against civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians. The country will soon mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military shot peaceful demonstrators and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening several free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have given young people access to criminal law.
USA should double investment in artificial intelligence
Since China works more actively with artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research on the subject, says the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government spoke of artificial intelligence, even though the United States lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the research budget on artificial intelligence would be a good start, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
An increase in funding may double the chances that the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence occurs in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ this month via the publication Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is Managing Director (CEO) of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest companies of artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that hit the highest ranking player of the game Othello, and later he worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was president of Google in China.
Lee recognized earlier technology competitions organised by the US, such as the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would be, so that he would be with and identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders, it's the big companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired outstanding students from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen discernment on artificial intelligence.
"I think that doctoral students before artificial intelligence is to be granted automatic maintenance permits," he said.
The Council of State in China published its plan for next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s national sciences association funds students at academic institutions, not unlike the American National Science Association and other state organisations’ way of distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a joint centre for artificial intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House declared the formation of a committee for artificial intelligence.
This month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (art intelligence) Next.
The National Science Union invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has worked on proposals for national security and artificial intelligence for several months.
Make-up noises in public opinion to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people rose on Sunday in a public debate if they should change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia to resolve a ten-year-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a requirement in their territory and has used veto to vote against Macedonia's membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name proposed, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change can undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he should not interfere with public education, and a boycott has questioned how much public education comes to reach at least 50 percent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question of the People's Dissolution Seat is, "Are you for NATO and EU membership and agreed to the agreement with Hellas?"
Supporters for the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the name change is worth membership in the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved self-esteem after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to discuss the future of this country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not binding in accordance with the law, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
In order to change the name, Parliament needs two thirds of the closure.
The State Election Committee reported that nothing unusual had happened before 13:00.
Only 16 per cent had voted, in contrast to 34 per cent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters voted.
"I am speaking for my children, we belong to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a head of state, Skopje.
The Minister of State of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko rose in Strumika in the People's Republic of Macedonia to change their names and to join NATO and the EU on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of public education in front of the Skopje Parliament, by setting up tents and chairs.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not to change the name of our country," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us under the name of Macedonia, we can go to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
State Minister Zaev has stated that NATO membership will attract investors to Macedonia, which has more than 20 per cent unemployment.
"I believe that the majority are coming to a resolution for the change, of your 80 per cent of our citizens will become members of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after having spoken.
He said that a "yes" result can be interpreted as a "confirmation of our future."
A survey of Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research last Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters are coming to participate in public education – something below the required number.
Another measurement of the Telma TV channel in Macedonia showed that 57 percent of voters plan to rise on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said that 70 percent came to solve yes.
In order for the public to be closed, at least 50 per cent of the volume, plus one of the volume.
If the public opinion is not closed, it may damage the policy of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton's defense and scorer
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling dismissed Brighton's defense which led to a 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored for 65 minutes.
The Argentinian food took a fit on the middle track at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran past three Brighton Defence Players and reached open ground.
Suddenly Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He came around one defender, before he ran past several others on the edge of Brighton's penal field.
He got past a fit on the left and found Sterling.
The English bite used its first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to hit the Brighton Keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot straight into the right end of the target.
«Aguero still slid with his feet," said the City Coach Pep Guardiola to reporters.
"We talked about how he could play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave the sky blue the first advantage in the Premier League struggle.
That target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep inside the Brighton Territory.
He threw the ball in a beautiful way along the left end of the track to Leroy Sane.
Sane was on the ball while he was renting Sterling to the target.
The sky blue bites the ball into a target right before he unscrambles out of the path.
City will play against Hoppenheim in the Champions League group phase at 12:55 on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will play chess against Rockies in American baseball
With Nationals removed from Playoff Containment, there was not much reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has high competitive instincts, and hopes to take the "mountain" on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to "playoff" for Rockies, who runs a game over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies water at least 5-2 against the National Friday night, but looks forward to locking the first division title.
"Although we don't play for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team most likely playing at the highest level so far this year.
Who does not want to play with such conditions?"
It is still uncertain who to start in the Nationals on Sunday, but it may be Scherzer's to 'pitche'.
Scherzer, who then starts for 34th time, throws a "bulpen session" on Thursday and has to "pitche" normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, who comes from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump collects choosers in West Virginia
The President briefly referred to his first election for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing how important it was for the Republicans to vote in the U.S. elections.
"Everything we have done so far is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not putting up, but I'm jumping around to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "You can see this horrible, horrible group of democrats, you see it's happening right now.
And they're exaggerated that they're absolutely going to take back power, you see how they feel, how stupid they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and block."
"And you can see it based on the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "sin and evil and evil and dishonest."
He referred to Senator and Democrat Diane Feinstein, who got his audience to bend.
"Do you remember her answer?
Were you the one who played the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh no, I'm waiting--it was really bad body language--the worst body language I've seen."
Work is no longer tolerated.
They're intolerant to those who say what they say.
When the Momentum Activists in my local party blew up to censor me, it wasn't surprising.
I'm the last in a series of Labour MPs who have been told that I'm not welcome - just to see what I mean.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way because he protested against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticised to disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
When it came to how important it was to drive responsible economics, national security, Europe, and other similar themes as Jeremy ironically was rather inconsistent with previous leaders.
At the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it said ‘we want to meet inclusive and productive’.
In the last eight years of mine as Labour MP has Friday meetings we've just been like this.
In fact, today's meeting was not the same, and the promise of "sniffer" policy is the longest forgotten, if it was followed at all.
It has become more and more clear that different views are not tolerated in Labour, and that every thought is condemned by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became a party leader, when I used to be politically agreed on a sudden expectation that I should redefine myself and agree on matters I would never agree - whether it was national security or the internal market in the EU.
When I speak publicly, there's nothing to say about what I say, I always get a hold of social media and people who want me to go away while they criticise central politics and say that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues, who are getting sex discrimination and racist psychos on a daily basis, who are still professional and do not go away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period is how normal it has been to harass politicians.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should become more tolerant.
In fact, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone, and for each mistrust proposal and for each change in the margins, the party becomes smaller and smaller.
I have received a lot of advice over the last two years from people who have said I have to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will "just like me better."
But that's not why I chose to be involved in politics.
When I went to Labour, when I was still going to school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry with Thatcher and how the government failed the country. My classroom was about to fall together, so I wanted better public services for those who needed the most - whether it was as municipal councillor or government minister.
I have never concealed my political opinions, nor in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East can be in doubt as to what I stand for and who of the current leaders I don't agree with.
I can only say to those who are in favour of the proposal on Friday that when the country is facing a Brexit that will damage private, local offices and public services, I do not understand why people care to waste energy on asking questions of my loyalty to the Labour Party.
But in fact, I'm not the only message I've got to go to Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters in the electoral crisis, whether they're Labour voters or not: I'm proud to hold dives, and I promise that no one can get me to go off or change my policy and prevent me from holding dives in the way I think is best for everyone.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr goes to the top in Scottish rugby
Two of his 'tries' may change the result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr has continued to win in this very entertaining Tennant's Premiership campaign today.
They are now at the top of the pole as the only unsurpassed layer of all ten.
It was their sovereigns' defence and ability to take chances that gave their home base and coach Peter Murchie a good reason to be happy.
"We have been tested in the last campaigns, and we are still invincible, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Hey, they were nicer than us to take a chance."
Grant Anderson had a trial for 14 minutes, where Frazier Climo tried a conversion, which put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Captain Rory Hughes of Scotland from Warriors Lot Melrose gathered, and Jason Baggot took a "unconverted try."
Climo got a penalty right before the break, he scored and "converted" a "solo try" to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's "try," which became "converted" by Baggot, reduced the grinding coin by five points.
There was a long break when Ruarid Knott was seriously injured and put on bars, and from the re-launch, Ayr made progress through a "tray" from Stafford McDowall, such as Climo "converted."
The running captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, got yellow cards, and again Melrose tried a 'unconverted Bruce Colvine try,' at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to deal with Climo without the ball from the criminal record, score MacPherson a «try».
Climo 'converted' again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong his box kick and sent Gregor Henry away from home his fifth «try».
The star from the Scottish series, Still Game, starts a new career in the restaurant industry
The Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry, after it was discovered that he is the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays together with partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the next nine seasons will be the last, and it seems like Kiernan is planning life after Craiglang.
In accordance with official lists, he is the director of the Aföringmorn Limited.
The shooter will not comment on the case, but a source from Scottish Sun newspaper has suggested that Kiernan would be involved in the "progressive restaurant industry" in Glasgow.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia hopes that the right will open the seaway to the Pacific
Sailors patrol Marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flag with sea blue flags.
Lake Titicaca marine bases to the Amazon Sea were discovered with the motto: "The sea is ours. We are right
and the obligation to return to it.’;
In the locked state of Bolivia, the people can still remember a coastline lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict over resources in the 1800s, and they extend after sailing back to the Pacific.
These hopes may be stronger than in many decades, while Bolivia is waiting for the judgment of the International Court of Justice to come on 1 October, after five years of questioning.
"Bolivia has a drive, a sense of peace and unity, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians come to look at the decision of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Hague Court supports Bolivia's claim, and that Chile, after ten years of negotiations, gives Bolivia a self-reliance to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia -- striving to be elected again next year -- has good reason to hope for a positive outcome.
"Now we will soon be returning to the Pacific," he promised late in August.
But some analysts don't think the court is coming to let Bolivia have access to the sea - and that a little would have changed even if they had access.
The Netherlands-based United Nations Court of Justice has no power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia and has stipulated that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the court's ruling comes only six months after the last negotiations indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
For the last four years, they have far from promoting Bolivia's thing they've done the opposite.
«The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration» said Zárate.
Morales, with his contentious rhetoric, has killed what was that of Chile's goodwill, meant Zárate.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at a time, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the issue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's verdict was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given an ‘extraordinary opportunity to open new relations with Chile’ and a chance to ‘stretch at 139 years of inequality and gain both,’ he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime problem to win rumors.
‘Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific,’ he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see what we need to do to forget the past."
North Korea claims they won't be able to eliminate nuclear weapons if they don't trust the United States
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says that his nation cannot be the first to abolish, if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to follow up on the promises they gave during the Singapore meeting between the US and North Korean leirs.
Ri's comments come at a time when the U.S. Foreign Minister, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to start his fixed nuclear weapon plomase, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that the United States has a false hope that North Korea will subjugate if the United States continues to bring sanctions and opposes any declaration of the end of the Korean war.
Washington refuses to join in any declaration of the end of the war, without the removal of Pyongyang first.
Both Kim and the American President, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
But many are critical that Pyongyang is serious when it comes to decommissioning and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headgear is the last motto on the way to a handcuff near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will no longer need to search.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have discovered a number of large and special mains in their SS19 collection.
The highest practical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The biggest blow was an overwhelming, beige Valentino hat with a featherlike, at the brake covering the models its heads.
There was also another over-dimensional accessory under the motto show, including a jewelry watermelon, a trollman hat, and even a pineapple--but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also discovered a collection with more bizarre masks--just in time before Halloween.
Many of those colorful masks had lips that were sitting together and more like Hannibal Lecter than high couture.
One of the creations looked like dive equipment, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like a melting ice in the kitchen.
If you like this enormous dramatic motto, you can only look at yourself.
Mote experts point out that the huge hats are coming for the hall in a handcuff near you.
The oversized hats come right after "La Bomba", the straw hat with the 60 cm wide brake that has been seen on knowledge from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the most impractical hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent a new creation out on the catwalk--a beach bag of the same size as the bikini-dressed model that carried her.
The beach wench, with the color of burn orange and fried top with a white skin handle, was the most avalanche part of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during the fashion week in Paris.
Kendis-stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach towels in the fashion shops next summer - the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt that it is going to be ignored the demand for over-dimensional access."
John Edward: Global Citizens Need Language Knowledge
Private caves in Scotland are known to be at high academic level, and this continued in 2018 with outstanding exam results, which is only enhanced by individual and common success in sports, art, music and other social measures.
With more than 30 000 lifts throughout Scotland, these shells, represented by the Scottish Self-Reliance Council (SCIS), work by offering the best services to and parents.
Self-employed schools aim at preparing their higher education and higher education, career paths and the role of global citizens.
As a education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made pensum, we see that modern languages are popular walnuts in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak with him in his own language, then the word of his heart goes to him."
This is an important reminder that we cannot just lean on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
By looking at the results of the exam this year, we can see that the language is at the top of the league tables with the highest standards for self-employed students.
A total of 68 per cent of the highs who took foreign language received A.
The data collected from the SCIS 74 member schools show that 72 per cent of the highs received A in mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who took German, 69 per cent of those who took French, and 63 per cent of those who took Spanish also received A.
This shows that self-employed schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital qualities, which children and young people are absolutely going to need in the future.
Language as optional is considered equivalent to STEM (science, technology, engineering studies and mathematics) in pensumas for self-employed schools and other places.
A study carried out by the UK choice of additions and properties in 2014 showed that 17 percent of employers were involved in filling jobs due to the lack of language skills of applicants.
That is why it is more and more important with languages in school to prepare young people for social life.
With more job opportunities for language professionals, these qualities are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what type of career a youth has, if they have learned another language, they have a good advantage in the future with such a quality.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person the advantage of a competitive world.
Following a YouTube survey of over 4,000 adult British in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any other language than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language that was spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
To be able to find more languages, especially languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, every school is different when it comes to what language they teach.
Many schools focus on the classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are classified as important in the UK when we look forward to 2020, such as mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a lot of languages to choose between in self-employed schools and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish self-employed people are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the characteristics they need to close, no matter what future comes with.
One cannot deny that in this global business-oriented environment, language is vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called ‘international communication properties’.
Self-employed students will continue to offer this option, offering diversity and high competence for Scotland’s young people.
It needs to be done well.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish self-employed council
LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting time is soon for fans who are glad to see LeBron James debuters at Los Angeles Lakes basketball.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be playing in the pre-season fight on Sunday, against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the length of time to play has not yet been determined.
"It's coming to be more than one minute and less than 49," Walton announced on Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, argues that James most likely will play a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' schedule for the pre-season.
"I don't need a pre-gap at this stage of my career to get me ready," he said.
Trump West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
That's the first of Trump's five planned stop next week, including stop at friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a confirmation vote pending to choose to fill the position of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the forthcoming mid-term elections as Republicans are in danger of losing control of the congress when votes are taken in November.
How long is Trump going to be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it online?
Trump's collection in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. in the evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to record this week's hearings of the Supreme Court-designated Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited about debts of sexual abuse, with an expected confirmed vote from the Senate waiting for up to one week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary objective of this cavenge of collections is to help Republicans meet November's elections and get some time (driving).
So President Trump's campaign says that these five meetings next week are aimed at "promoting volunteers and supporters who the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", says Reuters.
“Congress control is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the busy campaign season,” says one speaker for the Trump campaign that refuses to be informed to Reuters.
Designed for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the collection can bring back supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw cover from Pittsburgh Media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican latent Patrick Morrisey, who has been requested in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and try to give him a raise in the mind measurements," said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows the stomach for fighting to keep hope alive on the singles on Sunday
After three unilateral sessions on Saturday afternoon the foursomes could only be as this Ryder Cup throne.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a completely invented sport environment, but one that players really believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would they say the moment is now?
"You had a six-point lease, and now it's four, so we'll take it as a little moment, I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he skipped off for the day.
Europe has, of course, taken four points with 12 more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, know that they have little wind in their sails, and they have a lot to encourage, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points from four.
Speeth has our dead from tea to green and rents after example.
The goutural screams of the celebration were higher when his round continued, seeking an important put to take match four all-squao.re when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His put that won the 15th match, was met with a similar scream, the type that told you he thought the American team wasn't out of this.
“You’ve actually only got buried deep and worried about your own fight,” Spieh said.
It's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Speeth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible story of Ryder Cup.
Europe's funny, but sweet couples are four from four and can't make any mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who were not supposed to shoot a bowey on Saturday afternoon, but the kids also checked the boweys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine holes on a path with 18 holes) on Friday morning.
The course, and the way their energy looks to move to and from this noisy, busy audience, says they're the players to hit Sunday, and it wouldn't be more popular players to seal a potential European saying when the sun goes down over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
I prefer both at the same time in different halls.
Talk if European honour is still too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work of Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles on the first nine, dug the Spanish and the Swedish into a hole they never came close to climbing out.
But on Sunday there's no one who can help you out of your hole.
Their fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interaction between their opponents, their advice, and their advice, and the way that a strategy can change a blind eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and takes a significant lease in the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA had the stomach for the fight that anyone, especially the Stateside, had doubted.
Europe takes 10-6 rentals in the Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's fourballs and foursome-combats with a 10-6 lease across the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a fighting Tiger Woods to take their fight so far on Le Golf National for four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side offered to keep the trophies lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a wrong American side in tomorrow's fourballs, and took the series 3-1.
The United States provided more resistance in foursomes and won two campaigns, but they could not get the subkey.
Jim Fury's side needs eight points from the 12 single-ball matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European smoke that wins four points in a row while he and Molinari, called Molliwood after an eye-catching weekend, is only the second pair that wins four points from their openings in four camps in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they turned out so nice to hit a match of Woods and American Roque Bryson Dechambeau with an even more after-supply 5 and 4.
Woods, who slid through two matches on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliants, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in row.
Justin Rose, who was cheering for the morning's fourballs, returned to the partners Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe has not yet received everything they wanted on a pleasant, breathable day south-west of Paris.
Three great times, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas have put the reference to Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 says about Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes when they lost the two holes in the opening.
Only two times in Ryder Cup history has a layer come back from a four-point base and entered into a single, even if the holder only needs Fury's page to draw to maintain the trophy.
After having been the next best for two days, however, it seems like a Sunday attack would be outside them.
North Korea says it's not going to talk down unilaterally without confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that, if sanctions continue to increase, the mistrust of the United States will increase, and that the country would not in any way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Powers that North Korea had done "significant measures" to improve relations last year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear testing site and promised not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't get any corresponding returns from the USA, however," he said.
"Without trust in the United States it will not be trusted in our national security, and in such circumstances it is not possible that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has brought several complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase" approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be paid to take gradual steps, his questions showed significant by not rejecting unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang had done earlier.
Ri referred to a common question published by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit of some time between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for the "decommissioning of nuclear power on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the Korean War from 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first surrender his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed talks to facilitate the lifting of international sanctions in North Korea.
‘The US insists on ‘nuclear decommissioning first’ and increases the pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective by force, and they oppose even the declaration of peace,’ said Ri.
"Trusting that sanctions can crush us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that once the sanctions are passed, our suspicions are only getting bigger."
He said nothing about the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president stressed earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead of holding three meetings between Kim and South Korea, his leader, Moon Jae-in, in the last five months, added: "If the party in this call for nuclear disarmament was South Korea, and not the United States, the Korean peninsula would not have stopped the way it has now done"
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different from that of yesterday, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was not possible to stop North Korean rockets against the US mainland, after President Trump of the crimes called Kim a rocketman on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to ‘totally destroy’ North Korea, ausra rose over Kim for his intention to take steps to disarm, but said that much work still had to be done and that sanctions had to be placed on the ground for North Korea to unravel its nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, and said, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But the United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council must remain very strong and without failing to get the complete, final, verified release of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to channel the funds to Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the page of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that there was progress, but a few hours later he condemned North Korea to come with "gang-like demands."
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile and also an atomic complex if the United States did ‘appropriate measures’.
He said that Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he applied for were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, and stepped against normalization of Washington's relationship.
Harvard students take the course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University this year has contributed to the fact that all students get more sleep, in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture that goes out to study in caffeine all night, which means that a user of caffeine will stay awake all night to study.
One scholar found that students at the top university are often inattentive when it comes to the most basic - how one should take care of himself.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of his battle in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the affected lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end of that, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I told this now, when I am old?'
She said that no one had ever told her the importance of sleeping--something that surprised me, he said to The Telegraph.
The course, roll out for the first time this year, explains to students what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improves their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the health services of the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after the students had severer sleep during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a sleeping room where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and how important it is with evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campuses, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know it won't change the behavior of the elevator at once.
But we think they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know -- the health effects by choosing to smoke cigarettes, let Prof. Czeisler.
The pride culture of day-to-day existence still exists, he said, and let modern technology and the growing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is an increasing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said--even to avoid going up to weight, as the lack of sleep sees the brain in the sweating mode and makes them constantly so.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after having our student he attended last year, the first year he was at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to press on to get a course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before they start at the prestigious institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that the elevators should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, and also for when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" coming from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can completely transform the inner clock, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga targets Gerrard's men down
Rangers went on a new landing on the road when Dolly Menga sent his post to Steven Gerrard's distinguished side to a 1-0 loss on Livingston.
The Ibrox-side was looking to take its first winner on the off-road side of St. Johnstone's 4-1-trium in February, but the team to Gary Holt caused only Gerrard's second defeat of 18 fighters, and gave eight points, a round under Ladbroke's leader of Premier League, Hearts.
Merge locks to seven minutes before half a time, and a ranger layout with lack of inspiration never seemed to be equatoring.
While Rangers now falls down to sixth place, Livingstone climbs to third and lies only behind Hibernate on target.
And there may be further problems in the stock for Rangers after the liner Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in the head, after an object apparently was thrown away from the side.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that celebrated Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Livy 11, who took a point with a dream shoe last week, and he wanted to have our pleasure in that way that well-bredly attracted his Qualifier to his opponents at every turn.
Rangers might have had the ball most, but Livingstone did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored only two minutes when Menga sent Scott Pittman his first post to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle-level player failed in his fight.
A long outdoor park from Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the return deposit.
Rangers took control, but it seemed to be more hope than a threat to their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morello knew that he was supposed to have punished the 20-metre mark when he and Steven Lawless collided, but judges Steven Thomson turned away from the Colombian.
Rangers managed only two shots on targets in the first half, but earlier Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly was pretty concerned about Lassana Coulibally's head and a thin shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the playing field, no one can deny that they got it only because of the "shoot".
Rangers again failed to handle a deep death ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball to Scott Robinson, which held fun to pick out the crowd for a simple finish.
Gerard paused as if he had replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and replaced him with an immediate effect when the player made a lock for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly race forward to block.
But Livingstone continued to list the guest team to play exactly what they liked the game, with Lithgow and Halkett sending out long shots on the long shot.
Holt's team could have increased the rent said at the end, but McGregor succeeded in preventing Jacobs in it, until Lithgrow left a long deposit from the corner mark.
Ranger's reservation, Glenn Middleton, had a new requirement for punishment when he supported Jacobs, but Thomson ignored it again.
Almanac: The Founder of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and we REKNAR ... the day he became physicist Johannes Wilhelm «Hans» Geiger was born in Germany.
Gears develop a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific carrier all along, Geiger was also a carrier in pop culture, as in the movie Bells of Coronado from 1950, with the apparently unlikely late cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man says, "What is this in all the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger numerator, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you see these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that come from the radioactivity in the minerals.»
Evans: "Yes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that calls for his name, lives on.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune defense to "see" red cells.
The new cancer vaccine can learn the immune defense to "see" red cells and kill them
The vaccine learns to recognise red cells as part of treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then see a protein that is common to many cancer forms and then reinitiate.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise red cells, experienced that the ovaries have disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them into the laboratory, so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancer forms, called HER2, and then reinvigorating the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “drives the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal cancer,” explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to getting immune cells from patients and “learn” the way they target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West initiates a Pro-Trump-diatribe, carrying an MAGA-lue, after hosting a TV-show Saturday Night Live. .
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was tapped into the studio during Saturday Night Live after an unremitting performance where he praised the United States' president, Donald Trump, and said he would make elections in 2020.
After having taken his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he had on himself a Make America Great-caps, he gave the Democrats a thrift and repeated his support for Trump.
"How many times do I talk to a white person, and they say, 'Why couldn't you be like Trump, he's racist?'
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a number together with the comedian Matt Damon, where Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate's legal election on the debts of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, the tape was uploaded to the West and uploaded to social media by comics Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to hack the West with the deposit.
The West also complained to the public that he had a difficult backstage due to his main blow.
"You called me behind the scene.
They said don't go out there with that hat on.
They're fucking me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said, following Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the down place?" says he wanted to "take over the superman, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want to go ahead with the world?

His comments led to public opinion at least two times, and SNL cast members seemed to be of great concern, Variety reported, with a person who told the publication: «The whole studio was dead».
The West was picked up as a son's replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, when her former girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner as a tweeter: “For one of the most courageous spirits: TO KEEP YOUR OPPORTUNITY.”
But the talk show, Karen Hunter tweeted that "the West was quite simply like him and it's totally amazing."
"But I did NOT choose to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe embraces and asks about ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
That is what we are also saying.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Medrappar, Snoop Dogg has been given the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last music-legged Prince, changed the name of a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington goes out against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for the sword-winding role as Jon Snow in HBO's selective medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the shooter, 31, has gone against the stereotype of the macho hero, and says that these roles on the screen often lead to young boys feeling that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought something had gone wrong and asked how one should deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones-mate Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he knew “very strongly” to address the problem.
"Personally, I am convinced that something has gone wrong with masculinity." he said.
"What have we learned men when they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit thinks that TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very human character.
He went on, "What's born and what's learned?
What is taught on TV and in the streets, what makes young boys feel that they must be this special side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time -- how do we change it?
'Cause it's clear that something's gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make Game of Thrones runs or follow-up when the series ends in summer, and he says he is "completed with battlefields and horses".
From November Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepards True West, which is history of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The shooter recently revealed that he was looking at the meeting with the woman said Rose to be the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, so that way it gave me my future family and my life forward," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the selection to Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are bordering the country, say health supplements.
About 40,000 new things were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transferred through six, and marked a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who received HIV this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health personnel said at a conference in the Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination by LGBT/HBTQ people is claimed to be more widespread.
Because of the conservative values in the country, studies have shown that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transfers of the disease come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to add late information from the GOP Senator, which explodes in 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
United States Rep. Maxine Wars condemned on Saturday claims that a member of her staff had issued personal information about three Republican American senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims were pedalized by ‘extreme right-wing’ investigations and websites.
"Slanders, liars and more false lies," Waters said in a Twitter poll.
The information provided included the addresses and phone numbers of the Americans Sens. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing about the debts of sexual abuse against the highest-ranking Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Puntit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the deposit was linked to Waters' office and issued the information to a member of the Waters staff, reported Hill.
"This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"One of my additions - which have received their identity, personal information and security compromised as a result of these unfair and false claims - was in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie.’
The issue of water was quickly criticised on the Internet, among others by former press secretary in the White House, Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is sin,” Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is blamed for something they didn't do, they don't have to be angry.
They don't have to be drunk.
They don't have to ask the blame for the blame.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer showed himself to compare the Waters' reaction to the criticism of the judges of Kavanaugh, who were owed by critics to be appearing too late on Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to take over Water's position in the middle of the election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"The place if it's true," he tweeted.
In reply, Waters said that her office had warned her "to correct the authorities and the legal authorities of these false claims.
‘We will ensure that the perpetrators are disclosed,’ he continued, ‘and that they will be held legally responsible for all their acts that are harmful and dangerous to each and every one of my employees.’
Johnny English beats again - spying on the weak Rowan Atkinson
It's traditional to look at Brexit's characteristics in all new films with a British angle, and it works for this relivement of Johnny England's action-commediae spof-franchie - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and which was relived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Do you want to become the new export agent in the country?
In any case, the great, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber blade has for the second time been given his new permission to fuck things up--his name signals more than anything else that he is a wide comic book of cinematologists in non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, he is the stupid, secret agent who passes in his barbaric desire to spread a little glamorous has got a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes with a simple melody to the wagons, theme during the Olympic opening ceremony in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveling and international mystical man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, something that left chaos behind.
There's one or two fine eyebrows in this last JE escape.
I love Johnny English who approaches a helicopter while he was wearing a armored suit from the middle age while the rotor blade hits his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy is on screen, but humor feels quite weak and strangely superfluous, especially since «serious» film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible itself now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor felt as if he was directed against children instead of adults, and for me Johnny England's noisy accident is not so inventive and focused as Atkinson's repressive suit in the person in Bean.
The permanent current entry is now that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, which detects the identities of all UK agents in the area, to the embarrassment of the agent at work - a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a minister of state who is a pumpious and warlord figure, who already has a complete breakdown of political population: Emma Thompson does his best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there is not so much in the script to work with.
Her informants inform her that when each active spy has been in debt, she must receive someone who is retired.
And that means that the incompetent Johnny English himself, who teaches at some elegant establishment, but gives informal lessons about how to work undercover: a couple of fine tribes here, as English offers a School of Rock-type Academy for Spioning.
English will be sent back to Whitehall for a state of emergency lettering and reunite with his former understanding assistant Bow, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moving to a subcontractor's job, an over-enthusiast role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little discarded.
So Batman and Robin's ability to get things to get awfully crazy at the Henry Majesty's Secret Service is back too fully in the meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman fatal, Ophelia Bulletin.
In the meantime, the Minister of State fell dangerously under the charismatic technology of the billionaire, claiming that he could solve the UK's data problem: the anxious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin to travel by a fatherlike wild game: dressed as servants, they put the guys at a nice French restaurant; they create chaos and sneak on board the Volta light boat; and English releases pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality concept to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are probably pulled out to the last sequence, but as loving and disciplinary as it is, it's quite a lot of children's TV all over.
Quite moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talents?
The Labour Party refuses that they are preparing a plan for the English to work for a four-day week, but will be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party now evaluates a radical plan that wants the British to work for four days a week -- but gets paid for five.
According to the report, the company manager will send further savings through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees by giving them an extra holiday.
Then he added that he could enjoy a three-day weekend--but still get the same pay.
Sources said the idea would "pass" with the economic agenda of the party and plan to increase the benefits of workers.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changed economy.
An older source from Labour told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected to be announced before the year shift.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a wish that fits into the near-party has to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker, as well as the party's industrial strategy.'
The Working Party would not be the first to approve such an idea when the Green Party promised a four-day work week in its 2017 election campaign.
However, the ambition is not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesperson from the Labour Party said: 'A four-day work week is not a party policy and it is not assessed by the party.'
The shadow canals John McDonnell used the previous week's work conference to strengthen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to withdraw power from the "unrecognised directors" and "professors" of rich companies.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the watercourse cannot recover their entire effort when a Labour Government could make ‘debts’ due to perceived abuse.
He has also confirmed plans to put employees in company management and create Inclusive Ownership Funds (including ownership funds) to provide 10 per cent of equity in private sector enterprises to add, which would receive annual profits of up to £500, about SEK 5000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, told the TV program "60 Minutes" about the FBI in the investigation of Kavanaugh that they could change their thoughts.
The FBI's investigation of complaints against judges Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final settlement of his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and it raises the question of the extent to which the Agency could influence some Republican senators to withdraw support.
In an interview sent Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that would make them redefine.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I'm mine, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said on my way into the hall, I said, I have spoken to the judges of Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, the claim came out and said, 'Have you done this?'
He was determined, determined, determined."
Graham's voice seems to be in stone, though.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite charge to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it, "let Graham add, and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her names could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is New York host to the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive configuration of stars that perform and a similar impressive mission; end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to the Grand Plenary of Central Parks, not only to enjoy watching Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes act, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concerters had to complete a number of tasks, or "actions" as voluntary work; send e-mail to a world leader, call a phone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been when it was 12 years ago to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of paying people with a free concert a real way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clickivism" - people feel that they make a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that it has registered more than 19 million documents from its support players and has participated in and pressed for a number of different objectives.
These actions have helped world leaders to publish commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which will affect lives to more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and announcements resulting from their actions, of which at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the safe means to date have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a British-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs who are obliged to "help children reach their full potential"; pledges to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end subnourished in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national government and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of undermining to a footnote in history," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, a public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 shares to demand that the United Kingdom improve nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition treatment.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, they ask, "What do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizens replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements lead us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among some of the actors who will be present at the New York Year's event, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the fleet as "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports - Internal Secretary
Washington may ‘if necessary’ because to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an opportunity to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that they are in the Middle East, that they want to share energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And follow the official, there are ways and means to handle it.
"The US has this ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the seas are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not go on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to participants on the events organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group that presents itself as the ‘vote to the energy consumer’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to managing Russia and Iran, and noted that they are actually the same.
"The economic solution of Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel," he said, while showing Russia as a "one-trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations come as the Trump Administration has been commissioned to increase the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, and replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this context, servants of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump of the United States, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘inappropriate’ Nord Stream 2 pipe project, which, in turn, Trump made Berlin a ‘captive’ for Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is designed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington’s intense opposition to the project is driven only by economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US holding has withdrawn from Germany, which has confirmed the commitments to the project.
Germany's leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country disrupts our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "run hard" to become president candidate in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would take a "deep look" at sitting as a presidential candidate after the mid-term election.
At a meeting of the Council of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider silence as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and it includes a woman at the top," said he, following The Hill.
‘After 6 November, I will consider it to be a presidential candidate.’
Warren took President Donald Trump to the councilhouse meeting and said that he "will lead this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," he said.
Warren has our crash in his criticism of Trump and his supreme-ranking Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the reconciliation."
However, a statement issued on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's own electorate did not think that it should remain a candidate in 2020.
51% of the "probably" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not remain a candidate, followed the Suffolk University Political Research Center/ Boston Globe investigation.
Thirty percent supported such an application.
The investigation showed more support for a round of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other highly-profiled democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidacy include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin his PTSD (post-traumatic stress) at Donald Trump Collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being held in September.
He was arrested and sentenced to a government event in the home on Monday night
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, makes me relate to other relatives who are beaten by PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers return with," he told the audience at a collection of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room” and said that his son and other war veterans “will come back to change a little, they will come back to her, they will come back and wonder if respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other military have done for the country, exists”.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was guilty of being physically elected at home against a woman, to have disrupted a report on the election at home and the storage of a weapon while he was Russian, followed by Dan Bennett, spokesperson for Wasilla Politi Department.
18 States, D.C. Challenge of support for new asylum policies
The eight states and districts in Colombia face a legal challenge to a new American policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing from re-elected or elected in the world.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-off-right short Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant in Grace v. Sessions fits into the fact that the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) archived in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the elected re-members" abused her, but US officials refused her application for asylum on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the States supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of applicants for American asylum, which nations face cross-cutting problems with their offspring and their choice in the world.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from immigration slavery, which allowed illegal immigrants who fled the country to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Minister of Justice Karl Racine said in a speech on Friday that the new policy "ignores many decades of state, federal and international law."
‘Federal law requires all asylum cases to be judged for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a barrier to conflict with this principle,’ said a friend-of-the-art card.
Advocates further argue in the summary that the policies that refuse access damage the economy of the United States, and that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provides necessary work".
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims of refugee abuse and re-election in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who have left their home because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,’ said the Sessions of 11 June in the publication of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu while dying twice in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was becoming more and more serious.
‘It was very tense,’ said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who calmed her feverish baby son at an evacuation centre in the destroyed city, Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances come with bodies.
Clean water is difficult to find."
Residents have been observed on their way back to their damaged homes, in what they're looking for through damaged properties and trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospital which was damaged by the earthquake, which had a force of 7.5, was overfilled.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who had broken back and shoulders, were upset outside Palu's Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outside due to still strong post-disease.
Tears filled his eyes as he told me that he knew the powerful earthquake shook the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughters in the fifth floor.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I believe, “Haris told the Associated Press, and left his family in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador owes China to “mobbing” with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper launched a 4-page advertisement in an American daily newspaper and highlighted the mutual advantages of trade with the US and China, the US ambassador owed China Beijing to use the American press to spread propaganda.
USA President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China's paid supplement in the Des Moines Registry - the state's largest salsavis - after having owed China to try to interfere in the U.S. Congress elections on 6 November, a debt China refuses.
Trump's guilt that Beijing tried to get involved in U.S. elections, marked what American servants told Reuters was a new phase in a escalating campaign of Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign government to place advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an increasing trade war that has seen them in circulation increase taxes on each other's imports.
China’s record of return early in the trade war was designed to meet exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supported Trump’s republican party, have said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
«China», Branstad wrote in a part of the Sunday’s Des Moines register, “debt the mob by running advertisements in our own free press.”
“In its propaganda media, the Chinese government enjoys the American loving tradition of freedom of expression and a free press by inserting a paid ad in the Des Moines register,” Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the aiscojosken down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited divergent voices and will not see any true reflection of the different meanings that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic path, given that the media is below the fixed thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers rejected the offer to publish" his article, even though he did not say what for a newspaper.
Republicans refuse female voters to lead the middle term with Kavanaugh Debacle, warns analysts.
As many top Republicans are standing town and defending the highest-ranking Brett Kavanaugh in a meeting with more debts on sexual abuse, the analyst has warned that they will probably see a return, especially from women, in the upcoming mid-term choices.
The feelings around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have recorded that they already wanted to go ahead with a vote.
These things cannot be undone, says Grant Reeher, professor of State Science at Syracuse Universities Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last eye-blind pressure on an FBI investigation would be enough to calm down his electorate.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisors and national spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protestants "November come!" while they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate when the Republicans, who run the judicial committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination trass in the witness burden of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation come to be outside the chart," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it already has our height, it's true.
But it may be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years of age, who, while not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public witness, which detailed the allegations of sexual abuse directed against the vast majority nominated, analysts suggested that a withdrawal could be followed if the Republicans press forward with the confirmation.
"This has been a confusing root for GOP," said Michael Steele, former leader of the Republican National Committee, early last week, followed by NBC News.
‘It is not only about the vote of the Committee or the final conciliation or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, it is also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have dealt with it,’ Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that participates in the election of Democrats, points to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be a little split over who they're going to believe in in the cool water of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little bit more side tracks with the latter.
A new opinion from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably threatened Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably threatened Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they believed that Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying under his witness burden, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's press, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, and at least another complaint, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witness to the Board of Governors of the Senate under the title of last week that Kavanaugh totally violated her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the highest-ranking sex organs showed her while they attended a party during the time they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web Plans to launch a new Internet meeting for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a start to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the Technology League, Inruptt, is a company built by Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid lets users choose where the data is stored and what data they have access to.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee suggested that the meaning of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
"It's a historic eyelid."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, home lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about the personal web store is that it's completely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authorisation through data’.
The idea of Inrupt, following the Managing Director of John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to all.
The company consists of the eyelight of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some additional developers with contracts to work with the project, as well as a community of voluntary encoders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google to not introduce a complete change where all their business models are completely turned over at night.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a media post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network collection built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a strong impact on the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will become the current founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this next epoch on the web," la Berners-Lee 10 l.
Bernard Water: WW1 Victoria Cross divine fair
The only English church goddess who won a Victorian crusade during the first world war as a fighter has been celebrated in her home town 100 years later.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Water won the prize on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A monument was demolished by his two children on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Water, said that it was "bright symbolic", that the stone would be decomposed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning performance.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Water led its battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918 "through a very thick fire and under heavy fire from fields and masks."
He later jumped up to the front line, and with the "greatest gallantry" led the line forward before he allied himself with a field sword and shot out three of the group.
Lt Col Water was killed by a German snowman on October 4, 1918, a little over a month before the war ended.
Michael Watern, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm tired of."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also left a crown after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Watern said that he was very proud of playing a role in the parade, and added that “the value of a real one is fully shown by the support given by many people.”
The MMA fan was up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead.
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a package of Bellator 206men, so you can't see the main event.
The San Jose bill included 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the UK on channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just in the Gegard Mousesi and Rory MacDonald were ready to meet each other, the sailors in the United Kingdom were once again amazed when the decks changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were a little impressed after they had stayed awake for the early hours especially for the fight.
A Twitter fan described changing the drawing series of children as "a kind of sick joke."
“It’s public regulation that 6 hours if the content was not such, they had to switch to the children’s programme,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Bellator, when he was asked about the transfer.
«Peppa pig, «yes».
Bellator Company President Scott Coker said they should work with planning to include British sailors in the future.
"I think that when I think about replay, I think we can figure it out," said Coker.
"But the clock is six in the morning on a Sunday, and we don't find out this before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when it went over, there were many texts that went forward and back, and everyone wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, it won't happen the next time.
We keep it to five matches instead of six -- which we usually do -- and we tried to survive to the fan, and we just went over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley was known for sexuality
The Olympic rider Tom Daley says that in the growing up he felt worse than all because of his sexuality--but it gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24th anniversary said that he didn't understand before he went on his way, "not everyone is like me."
As he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island album presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he talked about homofiles' rights to give other "hope".
He also said becoming a parent made him less concerned with winning OL.
The permanent reporter in the long-term show, Kirsty Young, has taken several months free of disease.
What could look like an alien in Laverne's first program, Daly said that he knew “less than” all the others growing up because “it wasn't socially acceptable to equal boys and girls.”
He said: "From this day forward, having a sense of feeling less than and different, would be the real things that have given me strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "noko," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Bronze Olympic Medal has been a professional LGBT campaign and used its look at Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he knew well who could live up to him without misunderstandings and wanted to give other "hope".
The three-time world champion said it was to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprising me."
Daley married Oscar's winner, who is 20 years older than he was yesterday, but he said that the age difference never had a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age"--he went to his first OL 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later--he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar heights and downwards.
The couple were parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his whole perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at a age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 - when he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that you wouldn't be on the front row," he said.
"I kept busy when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead as I finally recognized that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at OL in 2012 and water bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life--to dive into a home audience at an Olympic game where there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired the first song of his--Stolt of Heather Small--who had vibrated with him in the construction of the OL and gave him still ghastly skin.
Desert Island Disks is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape his Mickelson on the bench on Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to turn the shape to avoid that it's an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12 times, was seen on the bench of Captain Jim Fury in the middle of Saturday's golfing in fourballs and fuhrsomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, which he has often been for the United States, split the five times the great winner's day between being a cheerleader and working with his game before the range of hope to correct what he's hurting.
Never the most competent long skates. Not at the top of your career, the 48-year-old is best to meet with long skates on the thong, French lead, where balls hit other than if the golf player isn't accurate with the battle.
And if the path itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth match Sunday, the exact British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has met with smokey Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 single struggles, get to a warm start, Mickey's fight can be absolutely decisive.
Fury expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much differently.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on his back and left his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has great confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer, and he's put so much on these layers in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two matches.
I saw more for me, but that's how it was, and that's how we thought we had to do.
He'll be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup matches that are played on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half, even though Fury said his proximity brought some intangible properties to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, entertaining, likes to keep fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the storage room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had the fun that got around him, too, this week, which was funny to see.
He contributes much more than just playing.”
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a large rental can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant rental on the way into the last few days' singles in Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an unpleasant journey.
Denmark made its debut in the 1997 Valderrama campaign, where a side captain of Seven Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came over the target line with the nose leading with the narrowest margins, won 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2.
"You continued to remember that we had a big rental on Valderrama; we had a big rental on Brookline, where we lost, and on Valderrama, where we won, but only so far," said Bjørn, after he had seen Classa 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to rent 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You're going to full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have scored the table.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is going to be.
I've said all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're so well aware of what's on the other side -- the biggest players in the world."
Glad to see how his players have acted on a thick golf course, adding Bearn: "I never wanted to take the victory in advance.
Tomorrow's another day.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performances that come up, and there's another thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there individually, you're going to test out your ability as a golfer.
This is a message you need to tell your players; you'll get the best out of it tomorrow.
Now leave your partner, and he must go and get the best out of himself too."
In contrast to Bjørn, the opposite number will be Jim Furyk looking after his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who pick up three points out of four.
Fury himself has been in both ends of the trade operations in the last few days, after having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ends losing when Europe left the 'Mirakelet in Medina'.
"I think every single word of it," he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, had gathered his players on their way into the last day.
«We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to get started with the fast start you saw at Brooklyn, which you saw at Medina.
When the time comes, put a lot of pressure on the middle-class campaigns.
We set up our line-up at the same time and set up the gutans in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to hire the match and meets Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the arrangements.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I think it covers the whole way," said Bjorn about his choices of singles.
Germany’s new warship is once again suspended
The latest cargo of the German Navy would have been ordered in 2014 to replace old warships from the cold wartime, but it will not be there until at least the next year due to the failure of the system and the defunct costs reported by local media.
The launch of Rheinland-Pfalz, the leader of the split new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been appointed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit-avisa, which cites a military speaker.
The ship would have ended up in the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery struck the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships ordered back in 2007 were replaced by the old Bremen class fregattans.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest fregatans for up to two years away from ports at home.
However, continuous delays in the fact that the ships that broke down the war, which some have allowed Germany to exercise power abroad, will already be delayed when they enter the service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 Fregate made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss verft in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of important ‘software and hardware errors’ that made the warship useless if they were deployed to a combat task.
Software error was particularly important when ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a team of about 120 sailors - only half of the labour force on older Bremen.
It also showed that the ship is a dramatic overweight, something that reduces the performance and limits the even fleet has to add future upgrades.
The 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in other world wars.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the price of the whole project - including training of the human being - will also become a problem.
It has been said to have achieved a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the introductory €2.2 billion (EURO)
The problems associated with the latest fregatts are particularly important in the light of the latest warnings that Germany's fleet will decrease.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually "has almost ended up on a distribution ship".
The officer said that the problem was over time because old ships had been dissolved, but no ship of compensation had been delivered.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg classes were able to join the fleet.
National Trust Listens to Secret Life for Flagger Mouse
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands is aimed at revealing how the flag mouse uses the landscape in search of food.
It is hoped that finding will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help to direct future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles and in addition brown langora and Daubenton flaggermus at the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special receivers will be placed in important locations around the property to track flag mouse activities throughout the season.
NHS additives and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
The expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the flag-mouse calls and what kind of species they do.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a naturalist consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal what habitat areas are, natural homes, which are most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work as a purchase of bait and the best way to maintain the same forest area for bats and other associated species.
Flemish populations in Scotland and above the United Kingdom have significantly decreased in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleep and loss of habitat/buplas.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as fly paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, and also attacks by pets.
Flagger mouse is not really blind.
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are still more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching predators.
They use sophisticated ecolocation techniques to detect errors and obstacles in their flight routes.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flag mice very seriously.
There are ten experts who regularly carry out investigations, sleep-place inspections and sometimes save lives.
The organisation has even created the first and only dedicated flag-museum reserve in Scotland at the Thrave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten flag-museum species.
Property manager David Thompson says ownership is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threeve we have a beautiful area for flag mouse," he said.
"We have old buildings, many vet trees and all the good habitats.
But it's a lot about flag mice that are still unknown, so that the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He underlines the importance of checking for flag mice before carrying out maintenance inside property, as it is possible that endless destruction of a single bubble can kill up to 400 female flags and young people, and perhaps eradicate a whole local population.
The flag mouse is peaceful and it is illegal to kill, scourge or disturb them or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the audience to come in and help.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about our flag mice and too many of our species we don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo rejects government debt in the lawyer's case for German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has noted the government's charges against himself as "false news", and says that people "want to highlight" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to investigate the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been indebted to rule an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's being claimed to have paid her $375.000 to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live Instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, says to his 142 million followers only hours after the debts, that the debts are «false news».
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news, says five times the Goldball winner into the camera.
‘They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be known to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all right, "put the player on and smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to investigate Der Spiegel's claims, which they have called "an unlawful report on suspicions within the area of privacy", according to Reuters
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for “moral damage in an amount that represents a serious violation of the rules, which is probably one of the most serious personal offenses in recent years.”
The alleged event is said to have found the city in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, claiming that he should have elected her anal, follow the document submitted by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and said that he was '99 percent' a 'good guy' and failed with 'one percent'.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken photographs of her injuries at a hospital, but was later consulted on an account because she felt "crazy of reprisals" and was concerned about "being publicly audacious."
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to change her mind as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was about to become with Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and in summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in a € 100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'ville for always undo' to lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom ‘will reject it forever’ if it lost its status as a world-leading driver before the production of cars after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was 'about' that Toyota UK had told BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of border delays in case a non-agreement Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaton plant - making Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, with 90% being exported to the rest of the EU.
"My point is that, at the end of March, some of the UK is leaving the EU, we see production stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnston.
Other British car manufacturers are afraid to leave the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns deal with what car manufacturers say is the risk of supply chains in the event of a non-agreement Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for vehicles ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the frontiers which the industry is seeking to lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's worth of inventions at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Checker's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid border checks."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I say, not only to enjoy the success today, but for us to take this opportunity," he continued the BBC Radio 4 agenda.
"Providing from not only Toyota, but other manufacturers are that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term, they warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost of work.
Peter Tsouvallais, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the United Union Association at the plant, said that his members are more involved: "After my experience, when these work goes, they never come back.
One spokesperson for the government said: "We have put forward a precise and critical plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's highest-ranking meeting with Vice-Leader Rod Rosenstein could be "pressed back one week" as the fight against the highest-right nominated Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the white house Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of the Special Council of Robert Mueller, which investigates the Russian electoral mix, links between Trump and Russia and the potential obstacle to the justice of the President.
Korvidt Trump will raise the general of the case voters or not, and thus endangers Mueller himself, has given food to Washington slags for several months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a lead to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to The White House, and it was reported that he was about to rise.
In the city, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose" not to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was held to avoid crashing with the Senate's hearing of both Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, witnessing.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, something that delayed the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "It has not been set a date. It may be this week, but I can and can see that it will be delayed another week because of everything else that happens in the Supreme Court.
But I get to see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters will probably disagree: Sanders has not kept a press orientation for the White House since 10 September.
True, Chris Wallace, asked for what.
Sanders said that the lack of guidance was not due to a problem with TV reporters' game for the gallery, even though she said, "I'm not disagreeable that they do it."
She called and that direct contact between Trump and the press came to increase.
"The President holds more press conferences than any president has done before," he said, quite rightly without the proof of the claim. "I have been watching."
Sanders says updates will still happen, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do this part, and you've seen us do it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press orientation if you can talk directly to the president of the United States."
Trump welcomes questions when he travels from the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It is unusual for the President to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated perhaps why, where he acted to lead the reporters without shame, and almost curious.
Health Secretary writes Brexit Frequently to EU workers at NHS in Scotland
The Secretary of Health has written to EU workers working at NHS in Scotland to express gratitude and a wish that they continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, who is a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter even though it was less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to taking into account the costs of applications which have been determined by the status of EU residents working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations on withdrawal between the UK and the EU have continued, and the expected end in the autumn is approaching.
However, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no agreement.
I understand that this must be a difficult time for everyone to dive.
That is why I will now repeat how much I value the contribution to all the additions, no matter what nationality they have.
Members of the EU, and outside, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health sector and are beneficial to patients and communities.
Scotland is clearly diving home, and we would like to be here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
Linebacker Christian Abercrombie, who plays at Tennessee State Tigers, went through an acute operation after having suffered a head injury when the team lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports The Tennessee newspaper.
Master Coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, reported that the damage occurred just before the break.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed, in a way," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a bar and took him back for further evaluation.
An official spokesperson from Tennessee State told WSMV that Abercrombie was finished operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
There are no details of the extent of the damage yet, said Harris, and let Tennessee State still try to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie goes to college the second year, and is in her first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five counts before he was injured in Saturday's fight, and is now up in 18 total this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when they purchase property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when they purchase property in the United Kingdom. The extra income should be used to help the homeless, follow the new plans of the conservatives
Determines whether Corbyn's success in attracting young voters will be neutralized
Increase in document fees will be added to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Statskassa expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds a year - to help the homeless
Theresa May today will announce that foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when they purchase property in the United Kingdom. The extra income should be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young voters who take a lot, with a promise to offer reasonable bus stops.
The increase in document fees will be added to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will strengthen the Government's desire to reduce the number of cross-border risks.
The fees, which come in addition to the current document fee, include the higher levels introduced two years ago on lease number two and rental housing, may be as high as three percent.
Statskassa expects the decision to reach up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13 percent of London's new buildings are purchased by residents outside the UK. This increases prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
Many well-being areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become "spaking cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers that most of the time occur in other countries.
This new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson would cut the document fee to help several young people buy their first home.
He hired large construction companies to keep prices up by taking ownership, but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up the allowances on reasonable buses to fix the UK 'bossam'.
Corbyn has announced a series of promising proposals for housing reforms, including controlled rentals and the termination of no-reasoned auctions.
He wants and gives more power to build new bus stations.
May said, "Yesterday, I said that I would dedicate my position to bringing back the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
This means fixing the damaged housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be right to be as simple for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, or for non-resident companies, to buy buses that are too hard-working, British residents.
Too many people have a dream about their own shelter too far away, and the audacity to be around is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The chief of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his ultimate ambition is to be Scotland's manager at a time.
The Scotch (42) solves the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east. They are currently in third place in League One, only three points from the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer, after having led St. Mirren back to the Scottish elite series in the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B-land battle, and that's it," Ross said to the BBC Sportsound in Scotland.
"But I grew up to see Scotland at Hamden with my father, and there has always been something that has brought me back.
It can only come if I succeed as a club manager.’
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he doesn't have any interest in coming up with so many established names in such a big club, as he has previously rejected approaches from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, success for me will be measured in whether I can get this club back in Premier League."
In the light of the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they are hearing from the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get them there, but I can probably only look at myself as successful if I’m going to get the club back there.”
Ross is only three years into his career as manager, after a period as assistant chief at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months in the heart training device.
He then helped Alloa to get from drowning to third level, and transformed St. Mirren, who was about to retreat, into the title winning series of the following season.
And Ross says he knows himself more comfortable now than he ever did while he was playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was quite a difference," he says about leading Alloa.
"I believed that being a manager is much better for me than being a player.
The right-hand bit, because I did it well, tried well and liked it relatively well.
But playing can be tough.
There are many things you need to get through every week.
I still notice when it comes to stress and pressure with the job, but it feels right to be manager.
I have always wanted to be manager, and now I am. It is the most comfortable I have felt in my own body in my adult life."
Sunday, September 30, you can take the entire interview at Sportsound, Radio Scotland, between 12 and 13.
Research shows that the perfect clock for a half-litre is 17.30 on a Saturday.
The summer’s heat wave has led to an increase in the insomnia of seeking pubs in the United Kingdom, but also to an increase in the pressure on restaurant chains.
In July the hall increased by 2.7 per cent in childhood - but for the restaurant industry it went down by 4.8 per cent, the statistics show.
Business advisor Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: "The present sun, and the fact that England was in the VM more than planned, means that July followed the pattern for June where pubs went up 2.8 percent, only that restaurants became even harder.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the restaurant industry was only worse in July.
Pubars and just like the sales drink, it significantly improved and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubars like sale food, received and marked the decline in the sun, even though it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It may seem as if people will only go out for a drink.
Among the pubs and just had the drinking room increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had dropped by three percent.
Paul Newman, analysts for travel and leisure at RSM, said: "These results are the continuation of that trend that has seen me since the end of April.
The weather, and the impact of a huge social or sports event, will still be the main factors when it comes to the living room.
There is no surprise that the restaurant industry will still fail. A drop in the hall of 4.8 percent per annum will be bad to get at the top of a running cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for food-powered operators. Time will show if the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can give a second breath.’
The total sales auction across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in the release of brand products.

One of five children has secret profiles on social media that they hide for parents
One of five children - some as young as 11 - have secret profiles on social media that they hide for parents and teachers, shows a survey
Study of 20,000 students on continuing reveal an increase in false Insta profiles
This news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the high says they have a 'head' profile they've shown their parents
One of five children -- some as young as 11 -- creates profiles on social media that they keep secret to adults.
A survey of 20 000 on the ongoing scale revealed a strong increase in fake Insta profiles - a reference to the Instagram image sharing platform.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the seniors say they have a sterile head profile they refer to parents, while they have private profiles.
A mother who sneezed over the secret side of 13 years old daughter found a teenage girl who invited others to “choose me”.
Researchers, made by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) at various schools, found that 40 percent of them between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private users.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create places on the web where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Elid Doyle becomes the ‘Athletic voice’ of the Scottish Freedom Board
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Management Board for Scottish Freedom as a non-administrative director at the annual General Assembly of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most decorated volunteer in Scotland, and director Ian Beattie describes the event as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience during the last decade.
«Eilid has high respect across Scotland, the UK and the world's civil society, and we are sure that freedom in Scotland can benefit from getting him into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for the performers, and I hope to be able to contribute and help sport in Scotland."
The American, who has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among its total four OL gold and is now a regular guest of BBC, was not able to go after a drop.
On Twitter, he wrote: "Today, it's a month since I got hit.
I couldn't go.
The legans said it was only time that could tell me if I came to be good again, or to what extent.
It has been our exhausting work, but I have become quite good again, learned to go again, and today I am doing flexibility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Splits Internet opinions about breast pumping that compare mothers with dairy cows
A breast pump company has split its opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing breast-feeding mothers with dairy cows.
In order to mark what is described as "the first silent, insidious breast pump", the technology company Elvie released a small piece of advertising inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom of the new pump gives mothers as an extractor of milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-full label with cows, to a song that includes text like, "Yes, I'm begging myself, but you don't see a hole" and "If you don't mark it, it's not spin, it's my dolls."
The refrigerated goes on to say, "Spring it out, pump it out, feed these kids, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladies."
On the other hand, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has created controversy on the web.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the lakes, and many say it highlights the ‘frequentness’ of the dairy industry.
‘Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and fed to produce milk, only that the calves are trusted from the days after birth," writes one.
Elvie breast pump is discreetly placed in an ame-BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: «I understand quite traumatic for both mother and child
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are keeping their parents?"
Another added: ‘For a remote traffic advertising.’
Others defended the ad, and a lady admitted that she seemed to be "solid."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I wanted to know if I was still Grandma.
Pumping got me to feel like a bitch.
This commercial is a little crazy, but I took him for what he is.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a ridiculous advertising directed at mothers like pumps (often at work or at toilets) and feels like cows.
This is not an advertisement that screams or condemns the dairy industry.’
At the end of the video, the group of women discovers that they have all danced with the discreet pump packed into their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women like pumps say they feel like cows.
Elvie-pump is, on the other hand, completely silent, has no leads or pipes, and its discretion within an amme-BH, something that gives women peace to move, hold their old, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: “Elvie pump is a such a revolutionary product, that it is a fanciful and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers who extract milk and milk cows, I would like to put a searchlight on breast pumping and the challenges associated with this, and at the same time demonstrate the unmistakable sense of peace that the new pump will bring, in a entertaining and recognizable way.
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the fashion show in London, a mother appeared up to two on the stage for designer Marta Jakubowski, while she used the product.
Dogs of immigrant children quietly move to tents on the border to Texas
The number of immigrant children in prison has peaked even if monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the strict policy introduced by the Trump administration makes it more difficult to place children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and taking up a child may threaten their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk of the increase in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would need to submit fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence witnessed from the Immigration and Customs Court of Congress and said that the Agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to be sponsors for equal minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had nothing on their roll sheet.
‘Approximately 80 per cent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of these are criminal aliens.
So we must continue to persecute these people," said Albence.
According to the laws added in the clay, new rules have now been introduced to manage the children. The rules require that some of them must now be in law before a month has passed, in the past 60 days.
Many will participate through video chats, not at personal meetings, in order to have their trial led by an immigration judge.
Those who are not qualified for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer children are in service, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to arbitrary rash or routing, they say, add in the clay. Reports that have appeared in the last few months say the same.
Speakers say that these concerns are greater in large installations such as Tornillo. Due to the size of the plant, it is more likely that one ignores the signs of child wear.
They allowed it to move children to the numerator without giving them enough time to prepare themselves emotionally, or if they were hated by friends, they could strengthen traumas that many already have.
Syria requests the US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked for Syrian refugees to come home, although the country is now in war in the eighth year.
Moualem, who, and acting as Minister of State, said that the front forces were illegal on Syrian soil in the wake of the fight against terrorism, and ‘will be dealt with from it’.
"You must withdraw immediately and without admission," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "fight a holy struggle all the way to the Syrian territory" for both terrorist groups and "unlawful presence of the front."
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, chiefly for training and consulting both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in that warlord country.
When it came to the problems of refugees, Moualem said it was safe for them to come back, and he blamed some Western countries for having “dispersed irrational fear” of the environments that led the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the return," he said.
"You make politics out of something that would be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria before a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebellion, has created an opportunity to continue pressuring political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement eliminates a major attack from Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including soldiers from the present front, who are linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eliminated."
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon gather the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draw up a post-war law for Syria, and pave the way for the election.
Moualem sets out conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee and says that the work of the panel should be limited to "to review the articles of the current constitution", and to warn against disturbances.
Why Trump comes to win a term
With that logic, Trump will win the re-election in 2020 if, as many liberal sailors are likely to hope, the presidency will end early due to scandals and rule of law.
Without a doubt, it would be "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!"
In writing, there is no sign that the lakes have gone wrong.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its rating for best transmission time to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has almost tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million stars in the best transmission time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, followed by Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has played at the top of the cable rating with as much as 3.5 million stars in the evenings with big news.
"This is a fire that people are being lured from, because there's something I don't understand," said Neal Baer in the ABC drama "Designed Survivor," which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the congress building.
Nell Scovell, old comedy author and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Five Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club”, has another theory.
She thinks of a trip to Drog in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he came to vote on Trump.
Why did you ask him?
"Because he makes me laugh," he replied after Scovell.
It's a maintenance value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the history coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families get together and health to the global economy.
Switching off is a luxury that only the most privileged sailors can take care of.
And yet it goes further than being an informed citizen when you find yourself at six o'clock to see a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of sources with "deep background" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafort's bomber jacket for $15,000 (a plague hit by arrogance," said Washington Post) and the implications of Storm Daniel's disturbing description of Trump's, uh, anatomy.
Personally, I never come to see Super Mario the same way again.
"Parts of what he does that makes it feel like a reality program, is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, daily leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and created by "Pawn Stars", about the show that goes with Trump's employees and day-to-day disputes (to enter a fight with NFL, rose Kim Jong-un).
You don't have the right permissions to skip one episode, or you don't have to hang on anymore.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was more than 25 degrees and sun outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He did not dare to turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate commission and the future of the Supreme Court hung in a thin thread.
"I think then all these sparrows showed me before and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," said Fleiss.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside flows into the closest interlocutor campaign
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees an abundance of money, thanks to a conversion of the districts of Congress which led to two sitting members fighting at the same seat.
The recently surrounded urban district of Pittsburgh promotes Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won its seat in another district through a special election in the spring of last year.
Lamb fights against another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, today a representative of the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely overlapped by the new 17th district.
The map was redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January found that the old districts were unlawfully designed to profit Republicans.
Competition for the 17th district has launched a weaponry on the financing of the campaigns, between the large parties' money pools, the Democratic Congress elections and the Republican Congress elections.
Lamb was a known name in Pennsylvania after a button said in a closely followed specialty in Pennsylvania's 18th Congress District.
The seat had been heard by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with more than 20 points.
Political experts give the democratics a little bit of a benefit.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama for partners to throw out the Trump organisation's rental group.
The state secretaries decided to bring back the US leaders for diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the spokeswoman of the department, in an early appointment this month.
But punishment was only assessed against El Salvador, which was estimated to receive $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings developed, North American and Central American officials exposed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar collection last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, the top administrators informed them that they wanted the conference to be held and put a stop to the assessment of the punishment of El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice-President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been planned in mid-October, as a signal of the importance of the administration putting the assembly together, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. broadcasts returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate that was described by the three American servicemen, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations of the introduction of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by a non-intellectual analyst who works closely with the administration and talks with young people in the presence of anonymity.
History student
A waiting for Special Adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, which is now significant evidence in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller must have turned his focus in the search for Trump's campaign, which was conceived with Russia, to plan an attack on our choice.
If Congress were to change rulers, Trump would have to stand up in this body, in which he prepares to convince the electors and perhaps a jury of his peers.
It is a lot of ‘what’, and I do not mean to suggest that Trump's case is inevitable – or for his opponent in Europe.
There is a choice to take for us all on both sides of the dam, which will affect how long the fight can be.
In 1938 German officers were prepared for a coup against Hitler, only the West had stood against him and helped the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed a chance to avoid years of bloodbath this led.
The course of history revolves around such a turning point, and democracy's inevitable march is accelerated or postponed.
The Americans are facing several of these turning points now.
What will I do if Trump kicks the Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on deep water since this newspaper revealed that he proposed yesterday to silence the president in secret, wondering if he was unfit for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is incorrect.
‘Will Corleis react to me if the recently requested FBI intelligence by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair — or is he accepted by the Supreme Court despite the unscrupulous charges of sexual abuse and unfair evidence?
And above all, will we in the middle election vote for a congress holding Trump responsible?
If I fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think I'm wrong, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country I have my embassy in.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me a guard to light the Sabbath light on the table asking for the shower.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the Rapid Vienna meeting
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that they say about the Austrians, after an impressively uncontested in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, they will give a good starting point to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A broken barrier to the middle track player Graham Dorrans in doing his first performance this season before the 2-2 result against Villareal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a jumpboard to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villareal is a good team," said the 31st.
“We went into the fight with the threat of getting something, and came out again with a point.
Maybe we could take it to the end, but everything is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then came out in the second half and it was better.
On Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
Hopefully, I can get three points, but it's going to be a tough fight, and they got a good result in their previous fight, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure I can run and get a positive result.
The last year definitely has our strength, with everything that has happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but now everything feels good.
The table is good and the gutane trives; the training is good.
Hopefully I can run now, put the previous season behind us and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this fear of retirement
Despite the fact that participants in a survey had clear thoughts about how they would be taken care of, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of those who participated in an investigation by the insurance company Nationwide said they talked to their spouses about the long-term costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their parents about it.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they don't take the necessary steps to have that conversation," said Vice President of Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and your old ones: you cannot prepare your family to take care of yourself if you do not want your familiar time on the road.
Cooperation with a consultant and your family to discuss how and how to receive care, as these choices can be a large part of it to determine the costs.
Get a financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance, a life insurance with cash value to help pay the expenses, or that you yourself are insured with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Create legal documents: Reject legal campaigns before starting.
Get a health authority in place, so you appoint a person you trust to have supervision of your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals are acting in line with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can also assess a mandate for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make economic decisions and make sure that your accounts are paid if you do not have the possibility to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Make sure that your old parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Put all these details down in a written plan, so you're ready.
"It's not just the finances it's about, but who's connected?" asked Martin.
‘What kind of medicine is it?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make the plan clear."
Man shot several times with Air Force in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air force in what he was on his way home after a tour of the city.
The sacrifice for 40 years was in the area around Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hands.
Politicians describe shootings, which occurred around 02.30 local time, as a ‘random action’.
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life threatening, and the police ask for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a severe earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, says public servants.
Without the possibility of communicating, assistant workers have not received any information from Dongala, a region north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter for the shield that had a force of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. Estimated population figure in 2017 was 379 800.
The city celebrates its 40-year anniversary when the sign and the tsunami hit.
Dongåla is an area that extends over 300 km with a coastline north-west of the island.
The region, which is an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and gardening are the region of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, particularly in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel casting is and is important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, as a result of the disaster reduction office in Indonesia.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses were destroyed by a tsunami in Dongala.
In 1996, the west side of Dongåla was hit by a tsunami that took the lives of nine people.
Indonesia lies in the Seismic Fire in the Pacific and becomes a smooth frame of earthquake.
Here are some of the big shells and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh province of northern Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Sea, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of great storm hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A wave of 6,8 hits south in Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that swept into the south coast and took the lives of almost 700 people.
2009: A storm of strength 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were left in the lurch.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands outside Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of about 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and took the lives of about 300 people.
2016: A little storm hit the Pidie Jaya area in Aceh and caused damage and panic when people were reminded of the earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunamis were solved this time, but more than 100 lost lives were based on buildings like rust.
2018: Great storm hit the tourist island Lombok and took the life of more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
Skulled destroyed several thousand buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily beached.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested and targeted for election in the world
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor in Alaska and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested, targeted for assault.
As a result of a report released by the Alaskan state police, Palin (29) was arrested on suspicion of domestic elections, interference in the reporting of domestic elections and opposition to arrest.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report a crime.
Palin's going to be a felony in the Mat-Su prison, and he's going to be held against the bail of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "not guilty" when he was asked, please enter the network.
Palin is facing three of Class A's crimes, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and get $250,000 in fines.
He has also been targeted for a class B malpractice, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin has been assigned to anything criminal.
In December 2017, he was appointed to have violated his father, Todd Palin.
Mora, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is up in the VW in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was targeted for attacks in the world, involvement in a report of the election in the world, and holding a weapon while he was injured in connection with the events.
His girlfriend had claimed that he hit the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups after linking the son’s elective behaviour to PTSD from the time he served in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of lives lost
At least 384 people have lost their lives after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The alarm, with a force of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and destroyed several thousand homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the next few days.
Earthquake hit right outside the central part of Sulawesi, which lies north-east of the capital Jakarta.
Videos that show the dramatic moment when the sign hits, blooms on social media.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the width.
Federal actors will rarely have a death penalty for suspicion in New York terror
Federal actors in New York will have death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of being killed by eight people -- a rare penalty that has not been committed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) must have used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway on lower Manhattan in October, where he drove down pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, the actors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims ‘by will’ and that he ‘by will’ caused them serious physical damage, following a note archived in the southern district of New York.
Both of these events may be the result of a possible death penalty, as stated in the legal document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury issued a list of 22 arrest points, including eight shootings for murder aimed at money printing, usually used by federal actors in connection with organised crime, and a search for the choice and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for ‘significant planning and settlement’, said the actors and described how Saipov carried out the attack as ‘disgusting, cruel and degrading’.
«Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage and loss to family and veins of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco», says in the note.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's ten years since the south district of New York has condemned the death penalty in one case.
The target, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to life by two double-species, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being sentenced to conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of information in the days and months following, in accordance with legal documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done was best, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing videos from ISIS on the phone, it says.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, the police said.
He hasn't declared himself guilty at all points of access.
David Patton, one of the federal, public defenders representing Saipov, says that they are "clearly disappointed" with the determination of the prosecutor's authority.
"We believe that deciding to go after the death penalty, rather than accepting a statement of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the dream from the event for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the actors not to go after the death penalty.
Member of Parliament in Tory of my Nigel Farage should rent Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the people's leadership" today, during a protest at the Tory country meeting.
The former leader of the British party of independence said that politicians had to feel the pressure of Eurosceptics – one of them suggested that Theresa May's Members should rent the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative, myrtle MP Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "had been out" now, whether Farage was the minister of Brexit.
The challenge of May is to send out its deep-separate demands have been underlined by a separate protest in the city, which is in favour of the Tories who wish to be in the EU.
The Minister of State was reluctant to keep up with the Chequers compromise on the right track following the attacks by Brexitiers, Remainers and the EU.
Allieds insist that they will press for a agreement with Brussels, despite the withdrawal – and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and the ‘caustic’.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave Group in Solihul that he wanted to "reject Chequers"
He proposed that Farage should be given a good standing and responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.

Arrested in the shooting of Louisiana State University player Sims
The Baton Rouge police announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in cases where basketball players from Louisiana State University (LSU), Wayde Sims, were shot and killed on Friday.
At 11 a.m. local time, the police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), in a press conference for ET.
They released a video of the shootings on Friday, and asked for help in identifying a man set on the video clip.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the camps give the Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment that Valteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the warehouses from Mercedes had a great role to play in the course.
Bottas got a good start in the course, and let Hamilton take care of himself in what he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack the team.
Vettel was first entered the depot and the fate of Hamilton came into traffic at the back of the loop, something that should be decisive.
The Mercedes ran into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton had front after a little action side-by-side which made the Ferrari driver counter-ville have to let the inside be at risk so that he could not defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st birthday, on the back row and lay at the seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he led large parts of the course as he went for a quick conclusion with the goal of running past the Kimi Raikkonen who was in fourth place.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but did not have to increase the speed of the last eight rounds while the Riakkonen was fourth.
It's a difficult day, because Valteri did a great job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who missed me.
The team has done an exceptional job that has both the first and the second," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made a joke by Senator Diane Feinstein on an election Saturday because she insisted that she did not post the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, where she addressed the Supreme Court-designated Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
In a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not mention the testimony for Ford had given directly to the Senate, but also commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "slow and weak and talking with us".
"The certain thing that may happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see the mind, when you see people who are sad and bad and uncomfortable and talk uneasy," he said.
“When you look at publications and toys and then say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you think it's smoke?
Diane Feinstein, did you?
Think of her answer... you left the document - "Oh, uh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Please wait.
Let me... no, let me not," he added, while he imitates the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the attack against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was played earlier in September - but Feinstein refused to let her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's talk, I didn't leave her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, which she asked."
But her refusal did not fall into the good soil of the president, who commented on it at the Saturday's election: "I say dive, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst language I've ever seen."
While he continues to defend the Supreme Court, who has been accused of having been subjected to three women's bad sexual behavior, the president suggested that the Democrats used the talent for their own gain.
‘They are determined to withdraw power in all manner they deem necessary.
You see the badness, the badness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," said the president, according to the Mediaite.
Eliteligen: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants (5-3)
Patrick Dwyer score two goals for Giants against Dundee
The stars from Dundee compensated for the loss of Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return campaign 5-3 on Saturday.
Giants had an early tom rent due to attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were compensated before Dwyer again sent Giants to the apartment.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secure the victory.
It was the third loss in the league this season for the Gutane to Adam Keefe, who struck Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
This was the fourth meeting between the creation of this season, where Giants has won the last three campaigns.
The opening of Dwyer came in the fourth minute after an assistant from Kendall McFaul, and David Rutherford served an assistant to Beauvilleer as a double rental four minutes later.
In what was a time of opening, Sullivan took home in the game again in the 14th minute, before Matt Marquardt took care of the equations to Cownie in the 16th minute.
Dwyer sure that Giants took the rent into his pause when he scored his second goal for the night at the temple of the first round.

Air traffic controllers lose their lives to ensure that several hundred of the planes escape from the earthquake
A pilot pilot in Indonesia will be hailed as a mere after he loses his life in what he continues to ensure that a plane with several hundred passengers arrived safely in the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are missing after a large earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disturb the area, and there are many who are trapped in riots in the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues fled for life, Antonio Gunavan Aggung (21) refused to leave his post in the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, although it was wild.
He remained to make sure that the plane that stood on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
Then he jumped down from the control tower when he threatened to collapse.
He died at the hospital later.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News Australia.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in a larger city.
Unfortunately he left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is heartbreaking," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid of a number of deaths will increase to thousands, while the country's crisis relief agency says that access to the small towns of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths increases while I find bodies trapped in buildings. Many of them cannot reach me," said the bureau officer Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six meters have destroyed Palu, which will keep a mass grave on Sunday.
Emergency assistance comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance comes with several bodies.
It's hard to find clean water.
The retail stores have become slaved.’
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is striving to help the survivors, but I don't know what they will find when they come forward.
This is already a tragedy, but it may be much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and said to the military in the country: "I beg everyone to work around the day to do all they can to help with evacuation.
Are they clear?" CNN reported.
Indonesia earlier this year was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, and 550 people died.
Aeroplane Management in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that you do not have a team after the plane flying control.
The airline operating an aeroplane operating in a Micronesian warehouse in the Pacific reports that a man is missing, having previously stated that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the aeroplane before the fall.
Air Niugini said that from Saturday afternoon they don't know where the human passenger is.
The airline said they work with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The airline did not give any more details about the passenger, and the age and nationality of the passenger is unknown.
Local shipowners helped rescue other passengers and crews after the plane hit the water when it tried to land on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, the authorities said that seven persons had been sent to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still at the hospital on Saturday, and everyone was in stable condition.
It's still unknown what's causing the steering and what's actually her.
Both the airline and the American Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses threatened that the plane flew past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"It was extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes allowed him and other passengers to wash through the water, which led them up to life, to the emergency exits of the plane before it fell.
He said that the flight crews had panicked and screamed, and he committed a head injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said sailors in the vicinity, who were working to repair a caravan, also saved passengers with a rubber boat they used to transport passengers to the country before the plane fell about 30 metres.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website show that 111 people have died in the gusts of PNG-registered airline flights over the last 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analyticals make timeline over the night when women were burned alive
The Attorney General presented all evidence on Saturday during the petition for a man appointed to burn a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He produced for the jury how he hacked up footage from mobile phones to find out what she was like when Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the man named Quinton Tellis (29).
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he used location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chamber's night he died, in contrast to what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed that Tellis' mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said he was out there that day.
Then he asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he "was lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers in about two weeks when she died.
But their mobile phone records showed that they only knew each other in a week.
Rowlett said that a moment after Chambers died, delete Tellis' messages, calls, and Chambers' contact information from their mobile phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defence must end the case on Sunday.
The judge said he was waiting for the trial to go to the jury later that day.

Another black person?!
Children's passports in New York apply for the "racist" text message
A child passenger in New York interrogates a couple to give her the trigger based on discrimination after receiving a wrong text message from mothers who complained that she was "one black person."
The couple have refused to be racist and compare the case with "expression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother to two, was dissatisfied when she saw that the child passenger had added it, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first got to work in 2016.
‘NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEI, ENDA A SVART PERSON,’ wrote Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending a message to her husband, he sent it to Maurice's babysitter twice.
Having admitted her mistake, the inappropriate Plasco-Faxman fired Maurice's infantry, and said that the former African-American infantry had done a bad job, so now she would have someone from the Philippines, followed The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before they sent her home to a Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple to get compensation for giving her the shot.
"I want to show them that it is not right to do so," she told The New York Post on Friday, and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have denied that they are racist, and said that giving Maurice the shot was the only thing they could do after having offended her, of whom they were afraid that she would come to take revenge.
"My wife had sent something to her that she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said the husband Joel Plasco to The New York Post.
"But would you let someone you've offended look after your children, even if you didn't mean to insult them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it."
Plasco compared the case to "expressing," and said that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a very difficult situation.
"Are you really going to arrest a person in such a situation?
It's not a nice thing to do," said the investor Plasco.
While this is happening, the public is quick to judge the couple on social media, and criticises them for their behaviour and logic.
The layout behind the Paddington books was afraid people didn't come to like a talking bear, revealing a new letter
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented: “It is difficult to see how it was to read the book for the first time before it was published.
It is very funny to know now how successful Paddington was.’
Uncle said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about the silkworm, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected, and she added that she had mixed emotions under her 60-year-old anniversary book, because her father died yesterday.
When it comes to Paddington, whom she described as “a very important member of the family,” she added that her father was proud of the extent of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he never broke," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having children who got something: you're proud of them even if it's not really you who's behind.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave all praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter was supposed to die and I had to say goodbye to her phone.
When she landed, the daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice at all speed, where doctors work to save her life.
"I didn't call regularly to say that it was really bad, that they didn't threaten her to do it," said Ednan-Laperous.
"So Nad called to say that she had come to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so glad in you, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be right back.
The doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping was slow on the way out of her system.
She had already died and now the body was about to shut off.
I just sat there, knowing this was happening.
I couldn't sit or scream because I was in a room surrounded by family and people.
I really had to hold everything in.»
Eventually, Ednan-Laperous, who now had to care for the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane with other passengers who did not know what had just gone through.
"No one knew anything," he said.
«I sat with my head bent while the tears fell.»
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how happy he was in her."
Providing women hang notes on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who committed suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have fixed notes on a bridge in Wales that will inspire and get people who are thinking of taking suicide to redefine themselves and call the numbers on the notes.
Davis, his son Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to know themselves as I know each day."
Davis, 45 years old and burly in Lydney, said that her son was a talented cook with a smile that was infected.
"All he knew because of his smile.
They said that his smile lit up all the rooms."
But before he died he ended up at work, because he was in a "very dark place."
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was the first to find Tyler after he had taken his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still worried that my brother-in-law may have been affected by Tyler's death."
Davis wrote the notes "that people should know that there are other people out there who care and who they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit there, you need to talk to someone."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davis for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
"He never said he was sick or depressed or anything," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he started acting differently.
He was in the cellar emotionally on Christmas 1st, when the children opened their gifts he didn't see at the entrances."
He said that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they continued to work through the dream: "It is a big void in our family now.
Me is completely ruined.
But we all have to fight to live on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if I actually got something like what he's asking – a limited research – I might get a little lonely," said Flake on Saturday, and added that he was afraid of the committee "feeling together" in the middle of a party's backlock.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
They smell because of the timing.
The U.S. average is only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans do not do so well, this will make it difficult for them to choose Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who works in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then has been secretary to Bush.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They come to the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh is able to collect at least 50 rumors in the Senate.
Number of dives in North Korea 'go down' during Kim
The number of North Korean divers to South Korea has gone down since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean legislator
Park Byeong-seus referred to data from the South Korean Union Department, and said it was 1127 falling off last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter borders between North Korea and China and more expensive fraud charges are the main reasons for the decline in the number.
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly.
Most of North Korea's stockpiles receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most refugees across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
The Chinese look at refugees as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and often send them back by force.
The relations between North and South Korea – which are still purely technical in war – have improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to negotiate the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
These talks follow the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for an atomic-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho owes the United States no money.
"Without relying on the United States, I cannot trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation we cannot undermine our weapons first," said Ri in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," and says he can't hold in the high chair.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the "hysterical" high school, and said he has too much temper to care for the American high school.
Pelosi calls Kavanaugh "hysterical" in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I know that if a woman had acted that way, she had been called "hysterical," said Pelosi about the burden of witness to Kavanaugh in front of the Senate-Judge Court on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and refused all objections that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In Kavanaugh’s opening address, he was very emotional and called at times with a lump in his neck as he told about his family and years of going on.
He criticised the Democrats in the committee, calling for talks against him "grotesque and a planned attack on his reputation," organised by liberal politicians who were ashamed that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi added that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he could not hold in the high court because it shows that he is prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I believe that the way he entered the disqualifies him, and what he said about the Clinton family and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi came up with an objection when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to leave if he was elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House.
“I can say this – if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he can’t hold on to the high school, nor can he hold on to the law now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is judge in Washington D.C.'s federal court of appeal.
Pelosi also said that as a democrat he is concerned about potential convictions from Kavanaugh against the law known as Obamacare and the case of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known for being a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he failed to answer questions as to whether he had come to turn certain decisions in the high court.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the high school who expects me to say he's great," said Pelosi.
And women must bend the sword
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she doesn't get it out without crying.
"We did it when we were angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high firm position, who said that she felt when she was angry, but developed a technique as she said to the person who made her so angry, "You might think I'm sorry because I cried.
I'm crazy."
And then she just keeps going.
I think it was brilliant.
Tears work as a way to get the mind out, but there's a lot of misunderstandings.
In one of my strongest memories of a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I realized of my mind, and a woman who was older than me took me in my neck – she was a cold tenant for whom I had always been free – and I went out at once.
"They never saw you crying," she said to me.
"You don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry and they're watering because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a congresswoman, a democracy from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987 Hart was taken on board a boat called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought she could as well hold elections as President himself.
"I didn't really think through it well enough," she said to me while she was lo, 30 years later.
"It was already seven other candidates who made the choice, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone calls the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Since the campaign had already taken place for a while, she had not collected enough money, so she promised that she would only keep quiet if she could collect $2 billion.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave $1000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they believe I get a discount?" he asked.
When she declared that she did not come to the election, however, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and aim at the loudspeakers instead of the delegates, and to think against gender discrimination, she began to cry under the speech.
"You should have threatened that I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said about how the press reacted when he saw it.
"You should have threatened that Kleinex was my main sponsor.
I think I thought, what are they going to write on my gravestone?
"The Grain"?
How the US-China Trade War Can Be Good for Beijing
The opening of the U.S.-China trade war was watertight, and as the battle continued, a gap between the two countries could be a long-term advantage for Beijing, experts say.
American President Donald Trump shot first shot this year to tax important Chinese exports, including solar panel, steel and aluminium.
This week, with tariffs on articles worth over $200 billion, in effect, means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken home and set tariffs between five and ten percent of US goods worth $60 billion.
China has allowed the United States to respond to every shot they fired, and the next largest economy in the world is most likely not going to go under the first.
To bring Washington to an end, China must do what the United States wants, but to go to the United States is too smooth for Xi Jinping, president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing holds the main call, the US press can have a positive effect on the Chinese economy in the long term, by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a firm political decision in Washington or Beijing can get both economies to go under is more dangerous than people have dared to admit before," said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for American Security, a thought-raising.
Syria 'clear' for the return of refugees, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily, and ask for help to rebuild the country that is destroyed after more than seven years in war.
As he spoke to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that relations in the country are making progress.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas damaged by terrorists to regain normal areas.
All entry posts are now in place to allow refugees to return voluntarily to their country they had to travel in due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond daily life and living bread.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
More than six million people in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would like to help build up the damaged country again.
But he pointed out that they did not come to accept assistance or help with conditions from countries that were in need.
Europe secures words in Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 when they beat the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown in the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjørn, they reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who took most of the tournament, took the ball in the water from the tea at 4:00 p.m. and gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari did it well in all its rounds and became one of four players who have received 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was turned off 5&4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, was 2 and 1 after English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who participates in eight Ryder Cupar, became the most winning European with 25.5 points in his career.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
So grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm so, so glad to get the trophies back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy to be able to help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He moves the sticker to the countryman John Ram, who hit the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2+1 in a single game on Sunday.
"I know an enormous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I wake up looking at him," said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all four campaigns in France, and now has a merit list of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
An interesting statistics from one of the world's best players, who has won 14 large titles and is only disabled by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team sleighed to find the fairway all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the whole tournament.
Jim Furyk, the U.S. captain, said after a disappointing demonstration from his team. "I'm proud of these guys, they fight.
There were periods this morning that warmed me up for Europe.
I'm locked up.
Hated by Thomas.
He's a lousy captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with PGA in America and our Ryder Cup committee and move on.
I love these 12 gutans and I'm proud to be captain.
One must take off the hat.
I got played around."
