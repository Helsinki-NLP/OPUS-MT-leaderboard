Right populists triumph in Austria, they have 29 per cent total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria have significantly weakened the two parties forming the current great coalition, as well as a notable strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffers particularly serious losses.
On the other hand, the EU electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, prepares a triumphal return on the political stage at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remained, with 29.8 per cent of the votes, the country's first political force, however, compared with the 2006 elections, to 5.5 per cent of the votes.
The OVP, which loses almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent, ended up even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major parties in the post-war war, especially for the popular party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
In early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable advance on the SPÖ.
However, the electorate is apparently incarcerating them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations concerning the possible resignation of the party leader and current vice-chairman Wilhelm Molterer were made.
Observers believe that this could happen on Monday at the extraordinary board of directors of the party.
Such a change would facilitate the first step towards the outcome of the most likely election outcome, namely the renewal of the large SPÖ and OVP coalition.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free ones (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 per cent and BZÖ eleven per cent of the votes - the Socialists at the same time expressed the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that BZÖ separated itself) on a common government, which even sparked sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he was ready to work with any party and that he intended to return to Vienna, on the national political stage, apparently on this trend.
The last party to have access to Parliament is the Greens, but they have slightly lost and fall, amongst the Austrian political parties, from the third to the fifth.
Of course, no other party has a limit of four per cent and does not enter Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are at risk of cooling
If there was no solution to the problem of the Czech researchers accused in India of illegal cafarding, the Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs Karel Schwarzenberg would see a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister told him today in New York after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he noted after the meeting, followed by a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, from talks, that executive power could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Svácha, who was acquitted of the charge and punished by a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being placed under the jurisdiction of the latter.
"Your problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
At that time, he could apply for bail and wait for the trial to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms that his partner expresses himself in the same way during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, as a result of which it could be thanked," said the head of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicted "competent legal support", the Indian minister mentioned.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided by India.
"We wish above all to maintain the best relations with India, which have a tradition continuing over many years.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We consider the incarceration and accusation of these Czech researchers to be a great disgrace," he said.
The Minister denied the question as to whether he had obtained from India the promise to take care of the case.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises," he said, "only.
A Czech arbiter fights for the bottom of the sea
It approaches a walled electronic map, on which Australia and adjacent marine zones are represented.
Now, he's not interested in the continent, but in a little lost point in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the seabed adjacent.
However, this area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of thirty members of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, the director of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and complete time to another.
The burning of work and enthusiasm characterizes the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a little known world so far, rich in natural resources.
There can be oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living organisms for the unknown moment, which may contain the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A Wider Background Than the Earth Stops
The littoral states have begun to assimilate with moisture in the new subterranean territories.
According to a United Nations convention, they enjoy their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called the continental shelf, which is often extended to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
The latter may, under the Convention, apply exclusively to all resources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, it is considered as a continental self the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent below the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred thousand seas, which represent an exclusive economy," explains Mikulka.
The request that the country concerned submit to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a broad scientific and technical documentation, based on numerous cost-effective prospects and controls.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the Commission with legal and scientific assistance.
To date, the Commission has dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the time being, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," Mikulka adds.
Australia's success, which is the first to have significantly expanded its submarines, has recently experienced a global decline.
New Zealand, too, has won from the territory - the extent of the seabed, which the commission assigned to it last week, is 1.6 million square kilometres, representing the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefits they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they have projected, be invaluable.
In progress, other countries will submit their requests in turn.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean background, declared by the "common patrimony of humanity", begins.
There, no state enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is attributed to an international institution established by the Convention.
"Nonetheless, we don't cheat, the seabed is not a Klondike," said Dr. Mikulka exaggerating, stating that "his areas are clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract."
Czech Republic in the Pacific
Part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other States of the former East L-block within the framework of the "Interoceanmetal" Joint Organisation.
It obtained in 1991, under the Convention, as well as some other States' investors, the status of the one called "a pioneer investor".
It has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area visited by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is moved there, it's kind of a submarine replica of the Tatras.
"It is possible to extract it from an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a rich cast in polymetallic concrements containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of this.
It reminds of a small potato of earth, or, with a little imagination, the mythical show, which, according to legend, fed the Golem.
The German special forces were in place for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had requested Germany's help in resolving the hostage crisis - experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready but never took action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists from Egypt are revealed.
According to the instructions of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, both federal army specialists and GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Force and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from Technische Hilfwerk, were on the scene of release.
As the spokesperson of the Departments communicated it on Monday night, the German forces were not finally required, the hostages who released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian government would have accepted the aid provided by Germany to integrate it on-the-spot as a support force.
"It has not happened so far, fortunately," said a spokesman for the Federal Interior Ministry.
The attackers had taken out in southern Egypt the group of tourists made up of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, and their eight Egyptian supporters.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transferred to the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers has so far remained vague, as have the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have, in the meantime, arrived in health and health except in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the released hostages were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin for the time being, no information was given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the Bild magazine, the five vacationers and the special forces should have taken off on board an Airbus from the Air Force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
The House of Representatives of the United States refuses the rescue plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress had recently failed the saving plan for the financial markets of $700 billion.
The Dow Jones was choking in the abyss.
With 227 votes against 206, the United States Chamber rejected the plan for saving the government's financial markets.
Despite all the appeals made by the President of the United States George W. Bush and the political men in charge of the two parties, the program that was supposed to undermine the chaos of financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the participants had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the well-founded $700 billion heavy plan.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debate, had called for a favourable vote, although the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he conceded.
During the vote, the Dow Jones dropped by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the State rescue plan could cover.
It was not long before the end of the vote, and then, after the failure was announced, it fell again.
Experts are now designing new major turbulences in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, approval and the House of Deputies and Senate are required.
Organizers report an increasing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In the case of reservations for the following months, according to one study, the number of cases increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite low economic prospects, the thirst for German travel remains unsatisfying according to this study.
With regard to the winter season reservations, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent over the same period last year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) entrusted to Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey of the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing number of reservations already dominates the month of fall.
Thus, the sales figure would have risen to about 11 per cent compared to 2007, according to the DRV.
The sources of these results are the figures of the GfK, which analyzes monthly the booking data of 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel reservations made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Due to the low rate of the dollar, travel to the United States would be particularly requested, the DRV would declare.
There, the increase in reservations would be about one Third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our opposite would be destinations specifically sought by the Germans.
The specially organized trips are very requested, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with discounts of anticipated reservations or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been so much retained that an increase in sales figures will be re-registered compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip has fallen compared to the previous year.
My first time at the beer party
Ballermann or Apres-Ski hits, beer in litres and celebrities in Tyrolean costumes to design.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I, we don't actually have much in common.
She is a blonde, television animator and wears a fine-sized Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is an opportunity.
But one thing connects us: only three minutes at the beer party, and the photographers are already throwing themselves on us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and that's my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The good-market Tyrolean costume seems to reach its goal.
As a tourist of the party of beer and normally living north of the Equator of Wytzwurst, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once on Therèse, it's half worse.
Each or almost wears a Tyrolean costume or leather pants; no one has the air bloated or afflicted with shame - it is completely normal.
Only the table of my Tyrolean costume picks up a few odd-eyed shots at the chocolate banana stand.
A Bavarian woman made me note that I would have misattached my table: "on the left means free, in the middle of the virgin, in the right-married, in the back of the widow."
Discreetly, I tripped my back loop to the left.
"That's better," she says, and she laughs.
Others do not give themselves so bad for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple pets, on which it is written "Too drink to get dressed!" and exposes us their naked background without being invited.
The young man in the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, who comes from England and comes for the first time at the beer party.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an "ooooo" extended.
He tells me all this after he's relieved of the bowl he's been drinking before.
Right next to this fire mouth that everybody thinks is a garbage.
So Bob is one of those sadly famous "wild bobs".
Others do not have the chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, rescuers run to the place of the party and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Rather, nurses intervene in mete - always by four, they draw their shield covered with tents in tents.
This works for most visitors to the beer party: we go empty, we return full.
Those who sit in the circle of the burrows under the tree are not visible.
"These are the ones who can't go down any more," she calls me one of the saviours in answer to my question and then disappears in the mill.
Police-identified accident victim
A 63-year-old pedestrian died at the hospital after being hit by a vehicle was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in a Friday afternoon accident in the city on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there.
As a result of the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested because he was suspected of dangerous conduct.
He's been released since, under bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons.
Even before Turkey did not intend to join the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter its back country.
On the east side of Bosphore, at least 20 can be, from Asia, one of the finest remains of his imperial ambition is destroyed.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-renaissance style, by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
That's at least what the guides tell us.
The monument is equipped with horses at the bottom of the platforms, with sightseeing tours at each of its corners, such as certain German provincial lakes.
The stones are salt.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the billet we no longer have any doubts about the size of the company, which represents a move to the west.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a later to imperialism, wanted to achieve its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad and has the most known land under the name of Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its region in the vicinity, caused by the frozen frontiers of the Cold War, is over.
The British and the empire's forces further advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies outside Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an explosive ammunition train destroyed its subtle roof.
Turkish sources said it was a sabotage.
Since then, she has slowly fallen into ruin, embittered in the meds of history.
But today, the railway crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, underlines the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The isolation of its region in the vicinity, caused by the frozen frontiers of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a Turkish capital coach, Ankara, to visit the Turkish MP AKP Suât Kiniklioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The following morning, after a 10 and a half hours trip, driven on noisy rails whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital – presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning back to its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots is an example of a change in Turkish consensus.
He suspects the West, and especially Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, specifically built in stones and steel, in a developing district, surrounded by half-built commercial centres and many pastries in which middle managers in custom-kravate-men and women meet for morning business.
Suat Kinikioglu could have been a right-wing politician from anywhere else in Europe.
Custom, tie and he's even got a Black Berry.
" The aim of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey now into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly" he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
That was not the case with each other.
She was supposed to do both.
"But, at some point, "I asked whether Turkey should not choose?"
"Turkey," he said, "doesn't want to have a choice between the two."
He then stressed one aspect that almost all those with whom I had spoken have heartily told me: the Turkish railway route goes not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, it is therefore an advantage for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message seems to draw a Europe that travels metaphorically on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another night without sleeping, I thought of these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be found in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting for the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphore, I remembered the period during which Turkey was called "the disease of Europe".
At least there is no doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memory of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (deceased on September 11th) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Having already taken part in his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic heart of young people, Proteus.
The heart was supposed to include at least 21 years of age, but before Proteus could not sing his last song in 1979, many of us who had more than 20 years of age refused to leave the heart.
The name "Proteus" (which changed in shape according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the heart to manage any kind of music that was presented to him, whether it was Madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young heart was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod told us to "let music speak for itself".
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all there in music.
So sing!"
His luggage technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if it was never dictatorial or apparent.
Whatever the music standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If a driver was to be appointed knight, it's good Vernon Handley.
I knew him well from 1962 to 1982 when he was driving Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them ever disappointed me, and sometimes they even inspired me.
Tod Handley had so rare this combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated the drivers who, according to him, "focused only on some people."
There'll be a lot of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
Your necrology by William Woodruff (decided on 25 September) states that "in 1946, he resumed his studies in economic history in Oxford, and became a member of Hoblon-Norma research, while doing a BSc, a MA and a PhD".
That's what came from Woodruff's author's letter to Beyond Nab End, but that's not right.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor in economic history at Nottingham University, and ended at the same time, a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Hoblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to dissipate this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino " the Flamenco and life " because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew me to the attention of their simplicity and the strength they convey and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second taste for the super sales of Honda
In November Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitat, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
This adds to some refined mechanisms, which increase the comfort of driving and make it possible to save more fuel.
A change in the face of a revolution.
So it's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Honda Jazz aesthetically presents a very similar line to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before examining the new model, it must be stressed that this new Honda Jazz will arrive six years after the first generation market.
First, it is noted that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a sales phenomenon in other markets.
This is Japan's case, where Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Exactly in Japan, nearly a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more than one million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
Honda claims, however, that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz in 2007, it is planning to sell 100,000 in 2009, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has traded 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The managers of the Spanish branch are looking forward to selling 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to much pay off the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand managers expect to end the year with a sales of 22,000 cars, that is to say 4,000 cars unless in 2007, or a 16% decrease in sales.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain by reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a market share of 2 % in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this part of the market when the new model comes out.
It's the Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 meters long - on which the Niponne company hopes to commercialize nearly 200,000 cars a year around the world.
Depending on the markets and estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the sales of Insight will be made in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Content and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled during the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz is increasing its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 metres (five centimeters extra), its width 1.69 metres (two centimeters extra) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 metres, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change as much as 1.52 meters.
The dimensions are increasing and the interior space is also increasing.
This is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a fuel reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the box - which has a double background system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres of additional capacity compared to the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L box is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as rear lights or panoramic roof - is improving access to rear seats.
The doors that provide access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, along with the back doors of the first Jazz which would open with an angle of 67 degrees.
Engines are also new to this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two fuel propellers of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines have an i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases the engine regime.
The first engine 1.2 litres develops a power of 90 horses at 6,000 tre/min and 114 Nm couple at 4,900 tre/min.
This propellant - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
With regard to the previous propeller, which on the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaching 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'beautiful car' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, in particular by bees.
The Japanese company created a robot that, by imitating the flying of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. made this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Research of Sciences and Advanced Technologies of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of the Marks Management, BR23C is the source of the Nissan security shield.
This robot will allow vehicles in the brand to prevent collisions.
During his flight, each bee created its own personal space of an oval shape that looks much like the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the eyes made of the bee, which can be seen in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser tracker (Laser Range Finder).
He detects the obstacles that lie within a distance of two metres and in a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor immediately to avoid the obstacle.
"At a time when he detects an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by twisting its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The greatest difference compared to any other existing system is that the escape manoeuvre is completely instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Moving Laboratory and major engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned upward or downward, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
" Every second this device must only process information and act according to these data.
There is no need to retain the information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, which is why it can operate continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise us, but we are not talking about giga-octets of memory, or even megaoctets."
This is the first because of the development of new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced into serial cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot runs with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ions batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device on a satellite GPS navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding road obstacles.
They're afraid to be mortgaged.
It must be acknowledged that the United States Treasury, in addition to having a lot of cash to make plans, is not without genius.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with insolvency banks, they created a game to learn not to fail: ' Bad Credit Hotel '.
That's the 'Hotel of Bad Credits'... or stories.
The glamour of this apartment and especially the Master of Hotel leads us to think on several occasions if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
Of course, this game provides useful but little detailed information.
It's more a game reserved for teenagers.
What to do if the game ends?
Because a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, because it's impossible to buy a house.
Morgan Stanley opens his capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry to his table tour of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, which will spend nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new reception by a strong decline in its course in Exchange.
A week after the opening of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would purchase 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's regular shares at the unit cost of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The retained price is less than 19 per cent at the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities with a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global operation would be based on an average unit price of $29, 28 per cent above its current rate.
However, Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% to $23.07 to 17.00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," explained John Mack, director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but make it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis compels Wall Street's largest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: on Monday, Morgan had just announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares in Japan for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, explained to Tokyo that our pensions that participation would consist entirely of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation in the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover our risks."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its titles Morgan Stanley 7% below their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the benefit by action.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert in half a year its preferential securities into ordinary shares if the latter exchange more than 50% over the conversion price, or about $47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG will enable him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
A spokesperson of the group, however, refused to clarify the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has stated that he has "clearly" relieved his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks were tested for the group, which saw its course in Borse half-funding, while the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt ran out.
This cost was reflected on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the failures of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, announced that he had raised $15 billion, in part with Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refine the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, was the third to put a draft new Constitution to the vote.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" at the referendum, according to official results of 80% of the vote.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the suffrage was zero and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it was necessary to obtain half more than one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations and one count of a non-governmental organization had announced a wide victory of the "yes", between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa also claimed on Sunday night on Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution has triumphed in a tremendous way", he had assured the Ecuadorians, congratulating the governorate of Guayaquil, at 280 kilometers south-west Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place in a calm manner according to the observation mission of the United States Organization (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" advocated by the president.
The draft Constitution confers the power of the State on the economy, by reserveing it the "planning of development" of a country that is essentially living from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and currencies that send its migrants.
The project, elected by Korea in 2006, also grants enhanced powers to the head of the State, which will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year mandates and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Korea has already announced that it would use this power and challenge a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in that country of 13.9 million people, with 50% of the population living below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack against the raves of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian accompanying prisoners were taken captive for ten days in the desert this Monday, healthy and except in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at approximately 330 hours on board a special aircraft at the military base of al-Maza, at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on board helicopters to the Maadi Hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examinations.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the admirers," said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on tarmac.
Captured on September 19 at a safari in 4x4 at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, the Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been swept from hiding to another by 35 unknown predators.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Egyptian agency, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer reported that 30 special forces, escorted on board two helicopters, had launched the siege in the night just before dawn.
"A firefight exchange occurred, and half of the predators were killed, the others were getting away," said this responsible who demanded the anonymity.
He noted that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "light" unit had been sent to the Sudan in total summer, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through professionalism and the effectiveness of our men in secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied payment of a ransom.
The guard, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on a patrol, on which the predators were on board, killing in six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-United States Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which had immediately been deposed.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is taking place and this electoral campaign is under way.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the poverty of small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving?
What politician would remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
What in Quebec, as in Canada, do we not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spend three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only Chinon castle in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that it must be protected by all citizens, elected and all government departments, in concert.
In Quebec, the Federation of Historic Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 companies of history, heritage, archives and genomics are concerned about exploring history, preserving with three under the monks of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the dogs who guard our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision-makers throw their bulldozers against our forgotten old stones and cemetery.
When, a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of the Fortis bank
The Benelux states come to the aid of the Belgian-Holland Bank, as the first European banking institution in the event of a crisis following the snowstorm of the credit market crisis in the United States, in which the three countries share a partial nationalisation, with an amount of EUR 11.2 billion, this financial and insurance institution also having interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, also calling on the European Central Bank and the European Commission to compete.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis which has been widening for more than a year is for the Fortis Bank.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will purchase nearly half (up to 49 per cent) of the bank's capital in each country.
The bank will undoubtedly sell some of its shares, including, first of all, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year of the Dutch organization ABN Amro.
Last week, the Fortis actions started a vertigo crash. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
The analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to be allowed to fail.
No matter what Friday, the company's shares fell by 12 percent, to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, the shares have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to the leaders of society, is not realistic.
The management of the company accuses the uncertainty of the Atlantic, in relation to the adoption of the US saving plan of $700 billion, of being the source of the fall of the Fortis actions.
On Monday, the papers have already received a slight increase.
Friday, Philip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new director-general.
The financial agency also sought private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
In the past, the Belgian government announced that investors should not be concerned, and that they were not going to lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's clientele circle and no agency was killed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also purchased leasing companies.
A kidney in the cockpit
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate on the basis of information on their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of information on prescription of medicinal products, in all cases, to the agreement of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be between independent hands, otherwise it returns to handing out his chicken to a kidney" - recalled Richard Dicket, the program's creator used to manage prescriptions in Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance premium and the capital insured in case of damage, the health status of the client present, and if they consider that the risk is too high, they do not even ensure it.
In the past, they sent candidates to a medical examination, and they signed no insurance contract with them until they learned the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much less expensive procedure: from an identification number, it is easily available to the pharmacies, the data on the purchases of medications from the person in the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, what disease the person suffers and what his health condition is.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high fat rate in the blood, resulting in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some determine a risk coefficient at the same time, so there is no more to do to the insurer than the paperasse. However, minor problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a medicine can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or heat buffs, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers to be aggravating risk factor, while others do not.
Companies have developed research and data analysis, and they must request the patient's authorization before collecting the required information from the pharmacy.
In the meantime, they are forced by the authorities, even though they have not been penalised for their shortcomings in the past.
Since recently, some companies have also dealt with the results of laboratory analyses and relate them to data on drug consumption, thus being able to provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of use is becoming increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the expansion of the control circle of the authorities regarding companies specialized in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has developed further ahead of his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the individual's exclusive agreement.
It is another question to know whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her agreement, since if he or she refuses, the insurance does not sign an insurance contract with her.
Thus and finally, chickens depend on the well-being of the kidney.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are multiplying their trades by two.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit next to other issues, largely global.
Today, there will also be a French-India summit where there will be a question of cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union acknowledged that India is a major emerging democratic power to whom a broader right of speech should be given in international affairs, but Member States have not yet succeeded in agreeing on their support for New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
They were not too late on this issue, yesterday, at this 9th summit organized in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and the head of diplomacy Javier Solana, welcomed the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would multiply trade by two, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an ambitious objective.
In this sense, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights, and in this way air exchanges can also take place in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up negotiations.
The objective is to balance the situation on the one hand, India, which is the EU's first trading partner, and New Delhi, which is only in the ninth place among EU partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and a United Nations conference on this has been called for.
The conclusion of the Doha business cycle has also been requested, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains loyal to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce its toxic emissions by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the need for a global market at the climate conference scheduled next year, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent the rise in food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to address the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is now in the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting, he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, French companies are expected to receive orders for a value of €20 billion for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the press agency's information, the agreement would last for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Large presence of Italian publishers in the International Chamber of the Book of Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present in the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The International Chamber of the Book of Frankfurt awaits this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy 171,790 square meters of the Hall with more than 403 million titles in exhibition, and Turkey as a guest of honor.
This will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government at the Italian Papillon's inauguration ceremony: Italy will be presented institutionally, with a Point Italy- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the press meeting in the Room Struktur, on page 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and perspectives on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to data, the importance of foreign authors' books gradually decreases from the total Italian production, and in particular from that of adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
Steve Fosset's crew, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying on Nevada's desert, was found.
The debris were found on a 3,000-metre platform in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Within the plane, however, no human remains.
The sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, convinced the rest of the doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the one that Steve Fossett was traveling the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the surroundings.
In February , the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead .
The U.S. Transportation Security Office (Ntsb) reported that a team of investigators sent to the places, a few hours after the match, identified the device: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, missing on September 3, 2007, when Fosset decolla from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from Nevada border, some personal effects of Fosset were found by a couple around their home of Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, the money and a pulse.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, it became in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had made the world's tour by plane and without a ladder.
Of all these records, the one that had stolen at 15,445 meters of height, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect.
A 4x4 outside the community of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and clear angles.
Here, in synthesis, Glk, the last born of the off-road "compacts" of the house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a new wind in this sector.
Just by its non-standard, unexpected and non-conventional content, the communication will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, starting on 17 October.
Thus the advertising campaign that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unpublished mode of communication, through a futuristic 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A Maxi exhibition project, organized in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of the Milanian shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the auto in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real and three-dimensional format.
In fact, we'll have the impression that by looking at the image, the car's out of the picture.
Then, through the use of the Remove8 innovative technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, to then recompensate in a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to stimulate the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From the Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy has been ashamed of now? They are part of the group " Ultras Italy" which has been following the Italian national team for years, and which has never, so far, created major problems.
He never had any trouble with the anti-fitos.
The group's extraction is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verone, Padoue, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (unrealized) of Campania and Puilles were added.
They had tricolor flags on which their city of origin appeared: Saturday night, they were all removed to avoid being identified.
They're inspired by the English typhosia.
In Bulgaria, they found a typhosia of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available Italian phiposi, 144 tickets for the party: all nominees, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had control over them all: among those who went to Sofia, none had a Daspo running, none had been forbidden to attend a stage.
Four Italian phiposi who had a history of stage crime did not have the right to the ticket, and could not make the move.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, the typhoids arrested or identified in the riots may feed a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo bans the participation of Italian, but also European.
In short, our hooligans will no longer step up the stage.
Congratulations.
But now is the time of fear-imulation: that is, others risk adding to the hundred and fifty first.
"We must extinguish this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves like this" support the Viminal.
So, "keep your eyes open especially for the match of the national Wednesday team in Lecce"
In the Puilles there is indeed a small cloud of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday, the Casms that can even count on a section of Asia, that is to say secret services, which are just dealing with stage problems.
"The Duke-Duce hearts, and the arm stretched during Mameli's hymne? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime"
Here's Domenico Mazzilli's opinion (expressed in a really disagreeable way) since recently, director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously a prefect in Trieste, where he lived in a cloud of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 typhoosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - add No.1 of the Observatory - crimes must be attributed in the country in which the event occurs.
So far, this group has remained in the rules, now we will see what has happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about squiggles towards Mameli's hymnna: they're also not crimes, but if you let me, they're not cops..."
