The defender of Rubina, Pavel Mogilevez, told of the causes of the failed team game.
The Russians suffered four defeats in a row, as well as their departures from Cuba.
We're in the middle of every game, they're quoting Mogilez's "Experts."
So each of us needs to think about the causes of such a failure.
Further meetings are needed to prepare for and correct the situation.
How?
If we knew, we'd probably make it right.
But first of all, I think we need to add to a component like unanimity.
I think we have a problem with that.

On Friday, the official representative of the Office of the Gossovate of the PRC on the cases of Taiwan, Ma Syaoguan, said.

TikTok hides bad videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age.
China / Reuters image
The Chinese Social Network TikTok is censored by video clips that mention the Tianjanmen area, the independence of Tibet or the banned Falunjun religious group, says The Guardian.
The documents published show that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance company) is advancing the foreign policy objectives of China abroad by means of the annex.
The main part of the violations related to China's policies is the burning of hate.
In each case, TikTok has unfavourable publications in the context of general rules so that social networking does not look censored.
For example, the ban on the criticism of the Chinese socialist system falls under the general prohibition of “criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on the mention of incidents in the areas of Tianianmen or genocide in Cambodia is under "the history of China or other countries".
The document also contains a list of the prohibited names of twenty “foreign leaders or state officials”, including North Korean leaders Kim Chen Ira, Kim Ir Sena and Kim Chen In, Indian policy Mahatm Gandhi, American Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Sindzo Abe, South Korean President Pak Qin Hi, President of Indonesia, Joco Vidodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as set out in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by the administrators of the socket and may lead to user blocking.
Not too strict for the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited by the TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules are obsolete and no longer applicable: "We now use a localized approach to modernization, as well as attracting independent local specialists."
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publication, says the founder of the "Producer Centre" by Rustus Bogdanov.
"Producer Centre" is a Russian media company that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers "Producer Centre" are in agreement with the representatives of the setset, but the user materials can be placed without agreement, and Bogdanov is passed on.
On the question of whether TikTok can speak about politics or Putin, Bogdanov is in good faith and says that he has seen such publications.
The founder of Our Didgital Roman Zaripov agrees with the Bogdanovs: “The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: no shocking content, discriminating statements can be issued further.”
But under these rules, any content that does not like the moderators can be subjected to note Zaripov.
Zaripova is another Russian partner TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age.
Under the user agreement, TikTok can only be used by persons over 13 years of age.
Network administrators check their age by using artificial intelligence: nerve analyzes individuals and determines how many years a person looks, says Bogdanov.
If nervousness decides that the user is younger, his account can be removed, he adds.
According to the RBK, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow in September 2019 in WeWork.

Russians warned of false bank calls
In Russia, there has been an increase in the number of phone calls from frauds that replace the bank ' s phone number.
This is reported by Commersant with reference to the Central Bank data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator provided communication operators with information on more than 2.5 thousand numbers from which clients were contacted by various financial organizations.
In 189 cases, the operators found a sub-menu.
A further 218 numbers were blocked and, in 59 cases, restrictions were imposed on the use of financial services.
The deputy head of the Department of Information Security, CB Artem Sichev, told us that a large number of Russian banks had met.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Bank's warning about fake phone calls, referring to the lack of such a duty in the O-Link Act.
In the Open Bank, Rosbanke and Alpha Bank confirmed information about the increase in the number of fake phone calls.
As reported in the Bilaina press, some of the information on the fake phone calls reported by the CB was incorrect: the lists contain the numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Their blocking would lead to failure in the organization.
Artem Sichev said that the Central Bank is planning to establish a bank of fraud numbers to which the liaison operator will address each challenge to check the numbers.
He explained that amendments to the legislation would be required to establish such a base.

Barcelona blackmails Nimara
The Spanish Barcelona and its former Brazilian footballer, Neimar, are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the French attacker Pari St.
The case was almost brought before the court, but the Catholics suggested that the game be resolved without interference from Femida.
Otherwise they will deny it.
Neimar and his clever father, who is also a Brazilian agent, took an interesting focus: in agreement with Barsa, who signed the game in 2016, he was expected to receive 40 million euros.
However, literally a year later, the Forvard appeared in the PSG for a record of 222 million euros.
Nevertheless, he has received 22 million from Catholics and now wants to take the remaining 18.
In addition, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club should pay him even interest for the delay of payment.
When it became known in the capital of Catalonia about the claims of Neimar, Barcelona filed a meeting claim.
"Sine-Grants" insist that the bonus was based on the entire contract, from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the game was worth only a quarter of €40 million and requires the return of the proportion of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer of Naimar and Barsa, they almost agreed to return the "false" game to the lonno of Catalonia.
True, the deal was broken, but the hope for the return of the foreward remains.
And, as Sports reports.Ru with reference to the insulators, the lawyers of the club told the players that if the issue of financial claims is not settled in pre-trial order, it would rule out the possibility of a return to Brazil.
Naaman himself wanted to return so much that he asked for assurances that the Catholics would buy him back.

How to increase future pension and not re-process
It is possible to pay not only the RF Pension Fund but also non-State pension funds.
NPF is a private company, says "Volgograd Truth.ru".
They work as a contribution: you make contributions, the fund invests them, and in time, returns interest.
If you are interested in this way, first study the NPF information on the Bank of Russia.
All funds work under the same rules as federal laws.
Pension balls can be purchased by law.
The number of missing balls depends on how many years you don't have enough to earn a pension.
This approach is suitable for those who have worked informally.
In addition, a contribution can be made for your family, for example, for a household woman.
Recommendation for those considering retirement at the beginning of their career.
Increased pension payments were received by staff, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and persons who had worked for a number of years in the region of the North.

The evidence of the very fact that “mass disturbances” did not hold back, but in the absence of a political decision to put this case down on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the removal of the charges.
The division of affairs should be encouraging to society, but it would probably leave a deep dismay to the silhouettes whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence were in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining indictees under article 212 C.E. (mass disorders) - Alexei Minijello was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligation, and a few more hours later and fully rehabilitated: the CD withdrew the charge.

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help to prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogen has been studied weakly.
One of the most famous is solid dust.
Phytoestrogens have been studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (including heart-consistency, some types of cancer).

The Hydrometre Centre has named faithful folk monuments
In Russia, there are many popular customs that people are trying to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
At the Hydrometre centre, all the notes that are likely to work were checked.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can truly be trusted in the short term.
As Dr. Roman Wilfand, a scientist at the Russian Hydrometre Centre, said, if the sun is red during the sunset, the next day will indeed be as hot as our ancestors have observed.
And if the sky is white, then on the next day there will be rain.
The second working note is based on bird surveillance.
It's more like a flashlight if they're flying low, it's usually raining.
This is simply because when the air wet is large, the males are soaked with wings and feathers that they are forced to go down to catch insects, says TASS.
On different continents, there are people's landmarks.
Surka Day is a traditional folk holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on 2 February.

The oil-fifty of unknown origin was found on 99 north-east beaches in Brazil.
Pollutants were scattered two thousand miles [2,000 km] of the shoreline.
Communications of the first discovered oil-fifty began to take place on the second September.

It turns out that they're all identical and it's about crude oil.
In the State Oil Corporation of Petrobras, which was transferred to the analysis of the samples found, it stated that they did not, in their composition, correspond to the oil obtained from natives in Brazil.
"It's a dense oil.
It may be discharged from one of the vessels after the tank has been cleaned.
Many continue to do so.
And it is likely to fall into the ocean," said the Brazilian news portal G1 coordinator of the oil industry union of Pernambuk and Paraiba Rojerio Almeida.
He also added that, despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continue to waste in the open sea.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the north-east, environmentalists discovered nine sea turtles covered with a fully oiled trap.
And only two of them survived.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment, together with Petrobras, will begin cleaning contaminated beaches.
As long as the Institute's experts recommend to tourists and locals that oil be treated by the fifth party and that they report on all the pollution that has been detected.

The Russians don't want to retire - B. Matvinko
The Speaker of the Council of the Federation, Valentina Matvinko, believes that the Russians do not have sufficient stockpiles to fully earn the draft guaranteed pension product in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions by means of personal savings in the world is quite widespread.
Another is how timely it is for us to introduce it.
“In my view, a large part of the population now has income, from which they simply have something to spend on increasing pension provision in the future,” said B. Matvinko.
The Russians, in the view of the speaker, could not understand the mechanisms for the formation and assessment of the pension, as “permanent changes in this area have finally affected them”.
This does not mean that I oppose the improvement of the pension system governing its legislation.
“Russia is a social State, and we are obliged to do everything we can to improve the size of pensions, social protection of citizens.
But steps in this direction must be smart, responsible, taking into account national realities," said B. Matvinko, “RIA News”.
The Head of the FP stressed that if this initiative (the draft law on guaranteed pension product) is to develop, several basic principles, including voluntaryity, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the State for ensuring the preservation of pension funds, must be provided for.
The Ministry of Finance announced on 6 September that the draft law on guaranteed pension product (GDP) was sent for harmonization.
Among its key elements is the voluntary arrangement of citizens to join the stockpiles system, the preservation of long-term pension stocks by the State, the registration of the stockpiles by the central administrator, the tax benefits for business and the tax benefits for citizens.

A man-pouch is a character figure.
It's a hero whose story affects all generations and audiences around the world," he says in his press release.
Faygi recalled that Sony was also creating his own movie house, built around the Spider-Man.
"So it happened that he was the only superpowered hero who appeared in different cinematics.
So while Sony continues to develop his own community-wide Speedy, the future can predict unexpected surprises," he noted.
Tom Holland, who played the Man of the Spider in five films, apparently commented on the news, posted in his "Instagram" account a section of the "Wolk with Wall Street" movie in which hero Leonardo di Caprio shouts "I'm not leaving!"
Information on the contradictions between companies appeared in August.
According to the media, Disney wanted to get half the cash out of the Human Pauke films, provided that both companies would pay half of the cost of making paintings.
But it wasn't Sony.
The news of the possible withdrawal of a beloved superhero from the cinematic Marvel caused anger among many devoted worshipers.
Details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but said: "We have worked well over the past four years, and our joint desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many fans.
We're glad we can move forward together."

Regions were invited to share business support secrets
As noted in the Parliament's newspaper, on 27 September, the Chairman of the Committee of the Council of the Federation on Economic Policy, Andrew Kutepov, sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development, Maxim Oreskin, and to the Minister of Finance, Anton Silovanov, proposing to express his position on the initiative of the parties to the Federation to improve legislation in support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It is time to establish interregional relations
The Committee of the Council of the Federation on Economic Policy has compiled information from the regions on their business development and legalization programmes for self-employed people, as well as on the outcome of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of the development of SMEs and sent proposals to improve the existing legislation.
"To date, communication between regions has not been sufficiently established, and this has led to the lack of information by the business community in all regions of the senators on regional entrepreneurship development programmes in the country as a whole," noted Andrey Kutepov.
In the annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a set of positive contributions from regions for the legalization of self-employment and consolidated data from regions with proposals and issues (recorded).
In addition to its own ministries, the data from the regions are also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on positive work in the regions could give an overall impetus to the development of entrepreneurship.
The first step towards such an exchange will be to provide the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy," said the Senator of Parliament.
Useful experience
Today, in many regions, small and medium-sized business support programmes are being adopted and successfully implemented.
For example, in the Vologogow region, the Business Support Centre is operating, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in carrying out the certification of the ready product.
In the Ivanov area, a business support system has been developed to implement the principle of a single window through multifunctional centres.
In the region of Krasnodar, the start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives provide grants from the land budget.
In the Orlov area, the cluster development centre is operating.
The Amur area under the federal project “Acceleration of Small and Medium-sized Entrepreneurship” provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators established on the basis of the federal budgets of non-State co-generation centres.
In a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed continue to withdraw from the shadows
In the opinion of the regional authorities, a number of changes to existing legislation should be made to better support for small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, the Archangel region has proposed replacing the term “self-employment” with “business activities”, since it is “the most appropriate content of the public service for the promotion of self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In the Ivanov area, it is considered necessary to amend the list of activities undertaken by self-employed citizens, including activities on the separation and repair of accommodation, roofing, physical training.
The Bryan region considers it important to strengthen control of the poor dairy producers by means of the Mercury veterinary system.
In the Kostromian and Magadan areas, the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and of social entrepreneurship support are welcome.
All proposals from regions will be taken into account in the preparation of public support programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific legislative projects.
"All proposals from regions will be taken into account in the preparation of public support programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific legislative projects," assured Andrey Kutepov.

The "authorization" settings in Russia fell 100 times
In the RF Government it was estimated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries falling under the Russian food embargo had declined more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to President Vladimir Putin, 31 thousand tonnes of products were imported from the countries in the first half of 2019 against 3 million 442.2 thousand tonnes for the same period in 2013, the interface reported.
The value of the imported product was reduced to $226.5 million from $4 billion to 975.5 million, respectively.
It's about the supply of goods that didn't fall under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the volume of imports prohibited has been offset by increased imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.
Recall that at the end of August, the Government extended until 31 December 2020 the time limit for the rules on the destruction of agricultural products, commodities and food that were prohibited from entering Russia under the anti-dumping measures.
The document on the official legal information portal noted that the time limit for the rules had been extended for another year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
The original act of the destruction of the authorization was applicable to production from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, on 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Ukraine, as of 1 January 2016, joined the list.
The Putin ' s order for the destruction of illegally imported “authorization” (food embargo products imposed by Moscow in response to the West Anti-Russian sanctions) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government has authorized the destruction of “authorization” food in any legal way.
As the sanctions were maintained in the West, the RF also extended its response.
However, the measure does not apply to products imported by citizens for personal use.
The prohibition does not apply to imports of goods for personal consumption up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council, President of the RF on Civil Society Development and Human Rights, Michael Fedotov, previously called the destruction of food simply immoral, and that, in his words, has a negative impact on human education.
Furthermore, at the beginning of June, Roszupnadzor spoke with the initiative to prohibit the destruction of food suitable for use.
After that, a similar recommendation was given to the Government by the Human Rights Council to President RF.
