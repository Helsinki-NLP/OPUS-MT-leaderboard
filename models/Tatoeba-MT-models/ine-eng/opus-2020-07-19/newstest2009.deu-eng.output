The Prague Stock Exchange collapses against business closures into the minus.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange just at the beginning of Tuesday's business on the break-in of Monday, when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time it was the reason for the break-in on the Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, the response of the market to the result of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector.
The shareholdings in Asia
A dramatic case on Tuesday experienced the shares at the stock exchange in Asia, although the indexes could offset some of the losses during the day.
The index of Hang Seng Börse in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but later it was able to offset some of the losses, thus reducing the decrease to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprise Index, which monitors the movement of Chinese shares at the stock exchange in Hong Kong, fell by 3.8%, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares at the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then lost to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent.
"The timing for the rescue operation in the United States is uncertain and will affect the financial markets worldwide," said the head of the monetary authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong is determined, although it belongs to China, its monetary policy itself, that is, independent of the Chinese central bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft for financial support.
Otherwise, other countries would be affected by the break-in.
A bloodbath of American shares
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 billion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush's view would regulate the basic causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilise the entire economy.
The U.S. shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the most important stock indices recorded the largest break-in in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, a similar break in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was hardly any sign that the draft would not pass through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free case.
Congress grants: US government can pump 700 billion dollars to banks
The senior representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
It will be agreed at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators reached a breakthrough in negotiations on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system of 700 billion dollars (about 12 billion dollars).
However, this does not mean victory yet.
The congressmen must discuss a few more details of the agreement before they can publish the final text of the Act and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system is negotiated at the US Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, said this.
In the Senate, according to various indications, it could probably be agreed on the plan earlier on Wednesday.
According to economists, the plan should be adopted as the first important psychological factor for the survival of financial markets.
After that, however, there is a "refuge" due to the complicated mechanisms, how to help the markets in practice too.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have explained our different views on how a package for the stabilization of the market should appear," said Mrs Nancy Pelosi to the Agency Bloomberg.
According to your words, there could still be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislator met on Sunday night with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the Government Fund its final form.
This provides for the sale of unsold mortgage assets by financial corporations that threaten financial firms in serious losses and the stability of the whole system.
"We stand on the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan, but I think we are on target," said Paulson.
A signal for Asia business
The global financial crisis is also evident in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislator was trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday at the Congress.
This is why we want to reassure investors in the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where a conference decision could affect businesses on Monday.
Until now, however, it is not clear when both Houses of the American Congress are voting on the law, and it is also unclear whether negotiations in the last minute could not fail with a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will experience some changes.
The total amount to assist the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars will be provided as soon as possible as President George Bush asked.
But the Congress can block the expense of the rest of the money when it feels that the program does not fulfil its function, at another 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush values progress in negotiations positive
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the Congress can vote for its veto.
In spite of these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme remained, which was based on obtaining funds for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, then on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The US President Bush was also pleased with the progress.
His speaker, Tony Fratto, explained that Bush was pleased with the progress of Saturday and "estimate the mutual effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Constraint Gold Screen Saver
The chairman of the Banking Committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, the leading retailer, let the legislators agree on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law also restricts the so-called gold case screens for directors of companies involved in the programme and sets up a committee to oversee the fund.
This will be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and have made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also counts with help for homeowners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages that it purchases, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the debtors and allowing them to keep their houses.
Marek: Psychological Assistance
The proposed plan, according to the main economist of Patria Finance David Marek, is a good idea, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's why you don't know which mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are purchased.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share the losses," Mark told the iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week, it is not in the opinion of Mareks.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement that it comes to an agreement is at this point the most important," said Marek.
Due to knife cutting: MP3 player against phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile MP3 file can play, no MP3 player can call yet.
That's why, of course, it looks like it's better to buy just one phone.
Despite all this, there are sufficient reasons why one should submit to an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of future owners.
I'm sure it's hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical news does not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is also no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the regal, you probably dream of at least one of these.
So it is also simplified with music on travel, so with compressed music, - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to issue eight thousand crowns for a player, but a Pink-Floyd fan is likely to be a heavy headphone for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The life of the batteries is crucial too.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what phones can do doesn't even make sense.
No modern device is to be used as universally as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the phone and the Simsen, it can play music and videos, both capture, it has a better, a worse camera and maybe it can also navigate.
And if you're still involved in the smartphones and comms, you've got almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little wonder, because no fridge can grill and no TV camera.
But the universality of the phones also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the more often you will have to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy fibers.
Only a few phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, usually much less.
In this respect, Music Player (especially the easiest) is significantly more efficient.
That's why you should count on the cheap phones so they can't play music for more than a few hours.
If you're still on the phone, you'd better buy yourself another charger for the office - that's also true for expensive devices.
In MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good hold at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one upload.
There's another problem if you want to play the music on the phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the device has a USB shutdown, and not every phone can connect directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can play the music directly on a storage medium, but only a few card reader devices will be finished without reduction with the small memory cards used in phones.
For players you do not need special software until exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most phones and players themselves use a music library, sorted by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address list, like the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to serve, phones can more
In selecting a specific device, you should explore yourself, especially after the life of the battery, storage capacity, quality and type of sound, and of course also the comfort of operation.
If music is especially cool for you and you only hear it every day in the street, for example, then you will have a mobile phone that plays MP3 files.
That's what almost every phone can do.
You don't even have to check which music formats can handle a phone or a player.
MP3 creates all, and most of the music you get will be in this format.
The format is one of the most widely distributed, and also most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that uses Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also allow the purchase of music online.
You only need to call the corresponding pages of a provider (or other provider) via mobile Internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can already be an effective argument for why to submit a musical handy.
Unfortunately, the offer of suppliers is bad and usually only limited to fast radio shootings.
The prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, this kind of sale of music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) is expected to dominate the music industry in the future.
The phone's mostly with them.
If you like to listen to something, pick up the phone in the jacket bag while the player forgets to stay at home.
However, it is clear whether you always wear headphones or at least a wireless speech device.
If not, you can go back to the integrated speaker that has almost every phone, but only the smallest MP3 player.
The most likely advantage of the musical handys will be for many.
The cheapest usually costs less than three thousand crowns.
For three and a half thousand crowns, you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most that there are no normal headphones.
The best and technically sophisticated phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player is in the easy operation.
The easiest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity to the previous normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
It does not threaten collision in the form of an improperly used mobile Internet and then an alarming bill for data transmissions.
Which device should be picked up now
Also the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (Type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding map, two thousand crowns will be sufficient.
But be careful.
In the base models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive can read 8-GB memory cards as well.
If you already have a phone and want to buy another cheap MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
You are among the most demanding listeners, you prefer to take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the controls comes to the individual MP3 players.
At the most, here is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individual sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above manufacturer.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite well equipped, and the Czech suppliers offer virtually all services, as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classics to lower prices.
Perhaps this will not be allowed to wait any longer.
The fact that the Czech mobile service providers are working at the most expensive in Europe is often reported on mobile.cz.
On the other hand, the telecommunications authority ČTÚ also confirmed that the price for an SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in the regulation of roaming charges, it is likely that there will be a paradox - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS will be cheaper from abroad than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a struggle.
Maybe it sounds paradox, but there are three mobile networks in the Czech Republic and a penetration of far more than 100 %.
On the other hand, mobile operators are happy to see that there is an extremely high level of competition on the Czech market.
The Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) President of the Council, Pavel Dvořák, who has often said in the past that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with its own network has no more but many chances (by the way, he would probably not even find any frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market that led to a significant price reduction, which the traditional mobile operators had to respond to.
Before the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile there were similar voices on the market in the United Kingdom as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
Besides, you don't have to look for examples for long.
In February we reported on the start of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus rise to the fifth largest provider in the country.
Behind Mobilking is Penta's financial group, which has U:phones in the Czech Republic, among other things.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers are usually out of the way as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers at least half cheaper SMS than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to set a non-climate target group.
This provider is specific to men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - the provider they like and can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator firm of this virtual provider.
It is hard to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could take place in the Czech Republic.
The press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepíký also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
It is also relatively concentrated from the point of view of the service offer."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, the mobile service providers mean
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile phone provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look forward to it.
It will come to a market entry of Mobilking in other countries of our region," says Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta Group of Finance.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the current mobile service providers in the Czech Republic are not entirely entitled to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to ensure that there is no potential competitor.
Its interest at the start of a virtual mobile phone provider has long been shown by the GTS Novera Group, which wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the business sector.
"We have a great interest in offering not only fixed networks but also mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already been able to make progress in negotiations," said the press speaker of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
Maybe better times come now.
Non-official information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an unsurpassed wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room in the Czech Republic for a fully-fledged virtual provider.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far, no one has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Sršenů in his statement to the press department of Telefónica O2.
Other suppliers also point to the specificities of the Czech market.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds, in rare accordance with the declaration of O2: "We have not yet found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build further."
And she adds: "In the network of T-mobiles, by the end of the year, there will hardly be a virtual provider.
At this point, we had to have a specific offer to think in such a short time."
Vodafone focuses on meeting the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepýký suggests: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is precisely what we see from the customer's perspective as the best.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand
The behaviour of mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider called more competition, which would lead to lower prices and thus also to a fall in profits.
So why should it be made easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
That the providers can draw on a string when it comes to something, it also sets the long slope and Her around the formation of U:phone.
The strongest pressure in the direction of ČTÚ went at the time when U:phone came to the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This is also evidenced by the publicly available information from the ČTÚ website.
But now it's just U:phone as an argument why you shouldn't allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has recently been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile phone provider.
Taking into account the character of the mobile radio market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new actor would place high demands on the market itself and in particular on its services."
However, in view of this approach by mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not only the attitude of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately - unlike Britain and other highly developed countries - does not have the power to intervene in economic competition.
It has exclusively the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
But this related to this whole problem his very typical attitude.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile provider and a virtual provider on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not interesting enough for the classic providers," according to our request Kristian Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS.
The representatives of the suppliers would not be surprised by such a formulation.
From an authority representing consumer interests, including the fact that no one abuses its position on the market, this is more than a matter of concern.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the foreign country where virtual providers are working normally, it is to be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, it is likely that the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction do not belong to the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, it is really shocking that the almost already moving agreement of the three mobile operators is emerging from their reactions.
The question is whether it is really just a coincidence.
Just as the absolute same fuel price in the tankers is certainly only a coincidence and the result of a hard competition struggle.
"In this case, the Authority has not discovered any signs of anti-competitive behaviour, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way on the matter.
None of the suppliers have a dominant market position, so neither does he have the corresponding increased responsibility for his actions on the market.
The necessary instruments for opening the mobile phone market for virtual providers are probably also missing from the regulatory authority for telecommunications," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the ČTù, since telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is a single market.
On such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators have a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - for the market entry of a virtual provider, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile phone provider - logically - has the monopoly for its network.
This means that he is necessarily taking a dominant position in a particular segment.
Even if you do not agree with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are acting similarly.
Complaints of a number of stakeholders (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) are evidenced by the fact that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The decoupling of responsibility to ČTÚ is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, which distances the ÚOHS from the whole issue.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to implement the recently adopted telecommunications bill's novelty to extend CTU's competence in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must only know too well, but they probably have different interests.
It's gone if no one's looking.
The operation of any pseudovirtual provider, of which there are also several in the Czech mobile networks, is neglected.
There are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but only in part of the public.
This is usually the case for companies operating in the multi-level marketing sector.
Own mobile telephone services offer, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies are usually only selected.
The joke is that the company appears to be a classic company customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar sales.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be an infringement of the contractual conditions with which we will then be engaged, which can lead to the termination of cooperation with the company concerned," Martina Kemrová answered our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing is not happening to the mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such action.
These companies do not pay too much attention to their losses, while at the same time, unlike actual virtual suppliers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepýký points out some problems: "The law allows such kinds of speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a very low percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card does not run on their phone, so they cannot have complete access to it as the normal customers of mobile operators."
However, this should be at least unusual for the CTU alone.
There is also a further question for the ÚOHS.
Do mobile service providers close their eyes before such a move, why do they block a virtual service provider?
It is to be added that the ÚOHS has very strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not, it does not have to satisfy itself with the supplier's statement, they knew nothing about it and their business conditions would prohibit this.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As already stressed in the text several times, the market entry of the virtual provider brought a significant price decline in the various services with it.
Practically in all countries where virtual providers have been created, the classic providers have tried to prevent their origins from virtually more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - too small, or too strong a market, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies in these moments are in a position to intervene, not in the interests of mobile operators, but in the interests of their customers.
Whether it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators throw themselves at the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot give the impression that incompetence in these cases is more than favourable.
But we don't throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information agrees and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile phone market may be moving again soon.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile phone provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting other stakeholders (to discriminate).
And then the Czechs will finally no longer call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Hymne has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National Sky.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new photographs of the National Hymne where my home country is on the occasion of the day of the Czech State.
The Hymne was again recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
Four versions are available - with male or female soloist song, in chorus and in an instrumental version.
The song was taken by Katerína Knězzynková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the Hymnna versions are Otakar Jeremáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can hear all four versions at once.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
Earlier he had told the Czech radio that he had chosen the solo-variant singers with young, representative voices that are marked and popular.
"From the beginning, I have tried with both and then with the choir to keep a clear statement, so that you can understand the text well, so that a harmony can be formed," said the director.
The Czech National Hymne will begin its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde homev můj sang for the first time in 1834 at the stage of the standing theatre in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first strofe of the song then became an organic part of the National Hymne after the birth of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven national symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" Hymne sounds
The Prague transport companies transport on Wednesday for the first time also on a chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, Prague transport companies will enter the history as a date on which the first passengers will enter a train, tram or bus, which will carry an electronic coupon in the bag instead of a paper licence.
These can now buy about one hundred thousand people who own the chipcard Opencard.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or an annual coupon (just starting on 1 January 2009) and play on their chip card at the same time, in the info centres and branch offices of the transport companies at the U-Bahn Stations Museum, Můstek, Nadraží Holeshovice, Andel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobilisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have been available on the website of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used up to over four hundred customers in the afternoon.
Those who use the internet can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly in long hoses for their paper tickets.
They buy the coupon via the Internet, it is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branch offices of the city library.
"In these places the travelers also have a switch with trained staff, who advises interested people on buying the internet and also plays the coupon on the map," said the speaker of the Martin Opatrny project.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on the open-card machine that are placed in some subway valves.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, remember the drivers, the passengers may already have noticed them at the bus stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five of them in the city until the end of the year, but there should be eighteen," Opatrny adds.
The coupon controls an auto instead of the driver
The operation of the automatics that will work from tomorrow is simple.
You only have to enter the chip card, and the coupon purchased before is playing on itself.
The electronic coupons are valid not only in the capital from tomorrow, but also in the environment.
So in the suburbs and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants from the municipalities of the region reached the capital.
"In the trains that belong to Prague integrated traffic, train crews have read-only devices that allow them to check the validity of the Coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid organisation. This organisation brings together the roadmaps for Prague transport companies.
The pre-city buses have card reader devices on the box at the driver.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown on the driver, but the open card must be placed at a designated place on the side of the box.
Thus the driver controls the validity of the played coupons.
"If a driver wants to check the validity of the played coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver to ask for this information," Drápal said.
A passenger who does not drive with suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupons ends, can go back to the self-service machines where the coupons are played on the map.
The information on the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudettes demanded a People's Decision
In 1945, the Germans had sought to join the Bohmerwald in the United States.
This comes from a letter that is contained in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we would like to live under the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of South Germans were supposed to have turned to the U.S. presidents in 1945.
This comes from, among other things, a letter that has been kept in a private archive and which is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau ask the American President in his letter that he will not allow the return of the "Southern Gauss" - which was adopted on the basis of the Munich agreement of Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have rightly understood the situation and really want to make sure that the American units do not enter as oppressors and enemies German territory, but as freemen," says a letter signed by the words "People whose hearts are at the heart of the South."
Since the accession to Czechoslovakia - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - suggests that they would expect brutality, indifference, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American presidents to take over the protection of the Bohmer forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that you, regardless of the opinion of a quarter million people in this area, are addressing a foreign country that has oppressed and tried to eliminate minorities and has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allieds," is to be read in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is apparently the fear of the "Czech underpressors" race lists.
If the U.S. President is in doubt about the thinking of the Böhmerwald Germans, it would be sufficient if he in Böhmerwaldgau initiated a national decision on whether the inhabitants of the United States become or would live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter in today's knowledge of post-war history may sound somewhat naive, it shows, in the opinion of some historians, a good picture of the then expectations of the Germans.
Even though the Bohemian Germans had to realize at least that they would have to negotiate their removal from the Republic, only a few of them had such a possibility at all.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the South.
Others believed they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as Budweiser Deutscher at the Marine at the Baltic Sea.
When he came to British prison at the end of the war and was taken to a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to bring them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, they would get the Czech," says Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia thought that they would distribute it on the basis of the Beneš decrees from the Republic.
You don't think - then pay!
An emotional campaign is directed towards drivers
The most expensive action for road safety in Czech history.
The emotional campaign was also characterized by the media campaign that the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday.
The authority of Minister Aleš Rébíček promises to take drivers of dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to cut the drivers off from too fast driving and alcohol at the tax.
And they also remind them to get ready for the road entrance.
The campaign aims, in particular, to address young drivers, motorcycles, pedestrians and not least professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
Of this, the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign also testifies:
You don't think - then pay!
The words "do not think" are in capital letters on a sign sign.
And in a blood lacquer, the word "pay".
This should mean that one can pay a moment of carelessness with his own life.
The spots will "shock" the spectators by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the English countries, where you can see very normal images with dramatic images of accident victims.
It is promised that such accidents and the number of traffic losses fall on the Czech streets.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar beet and peits for the drivers
"For the riders, the motto is sugar-brown and peitsche.
Sugar is meant to save time when driving at red, for example.
The punishment is then the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver needs to be reminded of the risk," says the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Korán.
Therefore, information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says psychologist.
Even less effective is his opinion on tables that alert drivers to a danger.
"If you set up a static table warning against a danger, it will probably soon run away with the environment, and the drivers will no longer see it," says Koríán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The President of the provisional Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, has spoken for the return of virtually all the areas occupied in 1967, namely Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan, when peace with Palestine and Syria can be concluded in exchange for this.
He stressed this in an interview that was printed on Monday by Jediot Acronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," Olmert said against the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar high percentage (Israeli) because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He argued that any return would also include Oster Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozer to roll over his legs, as one of my best friends has to ignore a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in an appeal to two attacks in the city of July, where several people were killed and dozens were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temples and holy and historic places" located in the territory of the old city.
"The one who wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he went on to confirm.
Subtraction of Golan heights
Olmert spoke of a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which he considered to be an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the sides of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to close peace with Syria alone and on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan-High Peace," Olmert confirmed.
"The Syrians only know too well what they have to give up in order to get back the Golan heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (Shitical) Hisbollah movement; they will have to give up the ongoing support they give to the (Shitical) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the Dshihad (Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know her, in a remote bus the conversion is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewards and travelers can go on and on the bus during the trip.
"If we wanted to adhere strictly and formally to the law, the activity of a Steward is in opposition to the road transport law," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, last week when a twenty-year-old Stewardness came to life, was probably caused by the driver of the LKWs who crossed the bus.
At this moment the young woman sat at all the accident next to the driver, at the least safe place in the car, although she had two more seats.
But a bus can also have an accident at the moment, or a sharp brake, in which the Steward brings coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role in whether the bus is equipped with the vehicle letter even with parking spaces.
If this is not scheduled in the bus, the passengers must be seated.
The Student Agency's remote travel buses have no parking spaces; as confirmed by the company's director, Radim Janchura, compared to Aktuálně.cz.
"We have discussed this with the Ministry, and this first did not agree with the movement of travellers.
This has been withdrawn later, and we have reached a consensus that travellers can go to the toilet during the trip if they have their seat," he told his position.
The law doesn't know a Steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a Steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legal provision prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The road traffic law only knows the term 'vehicle companion'; however, its rights and obligations do not define it', says Hanzelka's spokesman.
On the other hand, the Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law covers this problem in a negative way.
"It is clear whether the bus in the product authorisation also has parking spaces.
That's all," he stresses.
Buses are divided into city buses where there are parking lots and the maximum speed is limited, coaches with parking lots and a higher allowed speed and distance buses without parking lots with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Horín does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards on board a bus.
"In a liquid way, not many dangers are threatened, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Also here is not safe when turbulence comes, and the Stewardess can hit his head."
"But if a bus breaks hard, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a road.
The safety of Stewards must be clarified by internal regulations," he says, and he also believes that this problem is not fully resolved from the point of view of the law.
Janchura is ready to provide services
Student Agency offers Stewards services as the only bus company.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider his profession risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that Steward's profession is risky, I'll take it away.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by travellers when entering.
That would also reduce the costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin founded the absence of Stewards in his bus. But his company only operates a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have any Stewarts, but we've been defending ourselves from the beginning.
sooner or later this ends with some fatal accident," he had not said a year ago for Týden.cz.
This was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a line bus to Naples, a young Stewardess from the Pilsen region was disappointed who had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian LKW was probably bent off the stand-bar and had blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid a sharp manoeuvre, but collided with the right advantage with the truck.
That the two seats for the Stewards were sold, Janchura argues.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
The company wants to expose the LKW professionals.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the Agency will not wait for the court ruling, but a financial compensation is also expected from the debtor's side.
An amendment to the law?
Not in View
A more precise regulation on the movement of Stewards on board a bus could bring a legal regulation that has been working on a thirty-story team of experts from the Ministry of Transport for over a year.
"But this has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones on the road," says Fachmann Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider Stewards' activities to be something that could seriously endanger the safety of travellers," says Hanzelka, where the control of the safety of buses lies within the competence of the police and the employment protection authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
In great words, there is no shortage in the letter of the WestLB board to the employees of the house.
By combining units of the Düsseldorf Monetary Institute with the Frankfurt Deka Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen financial group" can be created, it is said to be written on Monday.
The WestLB incorporates a "competence block" with sustainable yield power into such a business.
And at all times such a connection of the decisive attack on further mergers in the national banking sector could be.
This is how it is read when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult time.
Because the hit WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
Not only since the EU Commission, but also through the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Office, which the North Rhine-Westphalia Government has just made it clear that it is time to find a future solution.
From a regular connection between the Deca bank, which knows the savings customers because of their investment funds, and the WestLB has been speaking for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka-Bank-Chief Franz Waas was informed of the presentation of the half-years at the end of August, in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a land bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, he did not see any sense.
However, the Executive Board of the Deca, which is borne in half by the Landesbanks and the Stock Exchange Associations, has commissioned the Board to hold discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could involve the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks are free, that is, in the financial square, just started.
From the Deca bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, is among the most important employers in the financial sector in Frankfurt, it is not the first time that this is about consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it looked as long as the Deca bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba.
But nothing came out of this triangle.
The plans had hardly been made public, the Hessian government opposed the participation of Helaba.
The other two houses did not find one another in that way.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart instead.
But it has always given thought to a connection between the Deca bank and state banks.
However, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Helaba Board, had recently spoken against planning games about a relationship with his house.
Regardless of this, however, it seems to be true that there is a need for a merger of the different houses of the public-law sector.
After the selection of the country day in Bayern, a connection between the BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be made as the first.
For the Helaba this is not necessarily a good message.
If pressure increases to further mergers, you will go back and forth to the partners.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has so far experienced the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
A relationship with the West LB, the Hessen-Thüringen-Sparkassen-Giroverband, which is 85 percent involved in the Helaba, has set out a line at the beginning of the year.
Stay in the North LB anyway.
Such geostrategic considerations are, however, only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of individual houses fit together.
In June Merl expressed the crucial question of the business model to ensure the future of the Landesbanks, whether the German Sparkassen and Giroverband had not yet been answered.
In the end, there could also be a breakdown of the West LB, which, however, is not rightly desired there.
For this is also the case in the letter of the board of directors, it will in any case seek a "total solution" for the house.
How to bring each unit together with the Deca bank under a hat will still show up.
The second weekend is known as "Italian weekend"
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena's like his girlfriend with her, and so everything's different, he says.
Behind them, at the 5 litre beerfat of the brand Kaiser, stands a massively built carrier and proves the approximately 200 Octoberfest travelers, which deep tones can produce his throat.
Elena's just giving Luca a cup, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus park next to the Puorta Nuova train station, will start at 23.45 a.m. on this evening four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della Beera", arriving expected 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are reserved mainly for Italians, only Brazilians travel on a bus.
In an corner of the parking lot, the South Americans already sing next to their flag, they've celebrated already at night.
And so says Marco Guarda, it's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with furskins and a glasses with wide silver bends, belongs to the bus.
For five years they've been driving to the October party, three tours are alone this year.
At night, day after day on the meadow, at 2.30 p.m. back.
Last night would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
75 Euros costs the trip, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Bier, faithful to the Bavarian offer of cleanliness, the health insurance and the German travel management - Marco has visited a language course - including in Frankfurt.
And the buses are already rolling in the night, on the highway towards "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon it will be quiet on the bus, the travelers asleep.
Well, they'll still need their strength.
It is held in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where there are also several other buses with Italian signs on the 8th motorway just before Munich.
When Marcos Group finally arrives at half an hour early in the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, they are already on the other 50 buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final address, explains the attack plan.
First, set up the yellow button.
On the left is "Oktoberfest", in Fracture, including the internet address of Marcos Travel office: "conscersiviagiano.it".
Second, "When the doors go up to the beer cellar, it's running!", Marco calls in in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the places in the back of the tent.
"Not before, otherwise we block, and not all yellows on the same benches, distribute in space!"
The measure, Brult Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the drinking money.
"The security officers show that we're doing well!
They will be gone as soon as you leave your homes."
Third: "This evening the point is half the 11th again here!" Understand?
And it's about the moon.
On the way, a yellow cap connects as road marks to the trees, to paintings and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian party.
You want to be armed for the retreat.
It's the second weekend, known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no precise figures; the talk is 50 000 who are on the way over the Alps and are in the beer fields, ten percent of all visitors are going to be extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are strengthened by seven South Tyrol policemen, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads to a national statistics, in which the Italians before the British (about 60) and Austrians (about 80) are first placed with about 200 medical supplies.
Especially popular with Italians is the yard.
Sleepless nights for believers of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, said Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relatively" and also suggested that the German banking sector would not be removed from the critical developments.
Because it's now in the weekend.
The Münchner Real Estate Financer (HRE) listed in Dax receives a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to shield themselves from the turbulence in the markets.
One person familiar with the situation said on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hippo Real Estate should only be the part which they also claim.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
There are losses to the daughter of Deffa.
According to a newspaper report on long-term projects for which he has lent money, the state financier has refinancing extremely short-term - which is now no longer possible due to the mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's stock exchange was reduced by 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio was slightly reduced from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Current earnings and net earnings from financial transactions fell to zero over the previous year's period, the revenues from claims and certain securities subscriptions and the resolution of deposits in the credit business fell by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only through higher income from reimbursements of deferred settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the repayment of interest after the tax regulation and from the management of group companies had the yield minus of about 16 per cent remained moderate.
The former state financier had first speculated after his privatisation in 1990 with commercial real estate loans, which were then distributed in the Aareal Bank.
Due to the lack of merit in classical state funding, the Depfa had then increased in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects by private investors and the State (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and international diversification.
At the value of the daughter, the Hippo Real Estate must now make a write-off that will have a "essential material effect" on the gain and loss of the group, it is quite uncertain.
The fact is, the dividends have been eliminated.
Already in 2007, it was cut by two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major public and infrastructure financier since the depfa acquisition.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing on the interbank market, as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the lending among the banks is largely promised again, as the banks heard their liquidity.
The Hippo Real Estate needs a part - about 50 billion euros - of the Depfa credit portfolio for short-term refinancing.
Following the notification of the Hypo Real Estate, the group's funding needs are covered by the loan at a time of notice and the company is protected "from the influence of the current largely inefficient international money markets".
From other sources, it is clear that, thanks to the funds, refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke explained, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to make the money markets available in due time.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Office (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secure.
This is hoped for by shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even inevitable that funding should not be fully implemented.
But also the opposite is not to be ruled out.
After the company was still insolvent on Sunday afternoon after the bank, at least the provisional rescue would not be able to calm the hostages.
The share rate falls by 75 per cent to EUR 3.30.
On the other hand, it is quite right to hold the exchange rates.
If the priority debts are barely shown, the rates of the subsequent bonds will be more clearly stated.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, of course, the maturitys that went beyond 2009 are affected.
Since hypo-real-state bonds are already a speculative investment alternative, their valueworthiness must be taken into account after a clear increase in the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only been affected by the overtaking of the Depfa by the crisis, when the stability of the international financial system depends on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as notable banks, governments and less-adjusted business banks are still ready to support the system, it is possible to spend a reasonable amount of time on the rent.
Or it will take what is currently unlikely to be expected - that the financial crisis will be overrun in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports which are beyond the scope of the partial provision, the likelihood of security is now only a legitimate hope.
In particular, long-term creditors should prepare some sleepless nights with the decision to separate themselves from their commitments.
However, short-term investors can use a profit margin for future tax payments to form a profit margin of later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself to Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls start to look at: The German is total "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells from Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I had Bammel before school.
I live on the coast of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and go 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way by myself. I didn't get lucky.
The beginning of teaching at Tachibana does not appear to be as strict as we do at home in Lower Saxony.
From eight o'clock, the students go in until about twenty-nine a short round of discussion begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before teaching started, I was on the line to introduce myself.
I am not the type who likes to talk to people, even before a class of 40 students.
Because I hadn't had a school uniform yet, I wore an old dress from my mother's guest, such as blouse, blue knee-brows and black leather shoes.
So in this lift I put myself in front of the pull and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I'm Sylvana, come from Germany and have a week's birthday.
At the time, I was very happy that I had started to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all swapped, chewed and chewed and constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'neglect, sweet'.
Then I'm in my seat fast.
The girl next to me was quite large, she found it an honor for the exchange student to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was regularly disturbed.
Everyone talked to each other and looked and asked me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break, all her bentos were taken out.
My guest mother had also made me such a lunch box - that's a little different from the fates of German breakers.
I had rice with herbs, small herbs, salad made from barley and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofumantel.
Mostly I don't have a blizzard, which is exactly what I eat here in Japan.
The things look strange and taste completely new.
I'm sure everything's really nice.
Well, up to the salty plums, maybe, brrr!
Bentos are not just lunches at Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento, which then she is particularly artificially restored - in the hope of getting to know the boys at the rest of the day.
That's what I read in my Manga comics.
I'm excited to see this, too.
'Why does Japan count?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I've always said:
"Because it fascinates me now."
Finally, I've been reading Mangas for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and culture there, I also started to learn a little Japanese sometime.
So it was clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, seats and pants.
And you put great value here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have not felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
Does a rat or a sheep fly at risk mean that it also feels afraid?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can you test whether they feel the same way if they behave the same way we do?
The Internet magazine " Edge" has been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other consciousness conditions, without me or anyone else proving this so far, where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we should at least hope that all human brains will have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we apply other species and cut out questions of the feeling or the general consciousness, we enter uninhabited sites because the hardware does not match.
If a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it kills, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists draw on a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
For one thing, the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its participation in the short-term memory and the performance/control functions).
This broad region is much higher in humans than in the other primates and seems to be missing in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason for the assumption that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic nature should lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since such a large part of his experience is connected with language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
However, even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, as it may also be acquired, would probably differ much from most of our consciousness states.
It is therefore difficult to determine how consciousness may appear in other animals.
If, as an internal and subjective thing, neither measure nor, because of the special hardware, can be analysed on our own experience, then his research presents great problems.
Most of my performances relate to the content of the most conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically easier to access.
Animal awareness processes could be investigated regardless of their content, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick pursued, one refers rather to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also stresses the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the coming of visualization.
What happens now to the feelings?
I bring it back to her that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a conscious brain in its own activity.
What we call "fear" is, therefore, the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, like physical reactions) is shown to be working memory.
In this way, feelings are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, the primates, and in particular the people.
Related to the linguistic nature are fine degrees of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar, we can differentiate and categorize conditions in order to assign them to ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings of more primitive activities in the regions of the cortex and the brain stem emerge similar to Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed very much during human evolution, it can be fully involved in cross-sectional feelings.
In theory, I can't resist it, but it's unmistakable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to rats and people like fear is likely in both cases as follows: How can you check whether rats and people feel the same when they behave similarly?
A sheep flees in danger, whether it feels afraid?
In my view, mere conductivity can still not prove the same as experience.
Although the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar brain stems, sheep do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it to people: How did you want to prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even sheep (we know?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, progress on the neural level is slowed down, if you measure the same for rats and humans.
As I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, neither do I feel, but I don't know if they exist.
You can keep it short-sighted, but I'd rather go ahead than walk against a wall all the time.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Gnaden-term for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa decision in Bordeaux as evidence of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize the EM together with Poland," Vasjunik said.
"But that's not amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or conversion of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are behind.
Perhaps even the number of EM stages is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We need to work at maximum speed now," said Ukrainian Federation President Grigorij Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep us constantly in sight."
An even more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Association PZPN has been suspended following numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious danger that the PZPN is unable to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation of the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several first-rates were convicted only in the past season because of manipulation due to the rise in forced labour, and even the start of the league had to be postponed in a short time.
Impressive Dennis Quaid beats back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in the interview about privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood-Star Meg Ryan outlawed her crazy Dennis Quaid as a husband.
He shames - and beats back.
The late Rosen war at the former spouse Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unpleasant dispute with each other - in all public.
Meg Ryan had first expressed himself in an interview with the U.S. newspaper InStyle last week on the grounds of marital failure: "Dennis had been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud has only led them to experience after the divorce.
The occasion for the soul stripping was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of a marriage break is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband fell out clearly: "Unfortunate" was, the 54-year-old of "New York Daily News", said that "Meg once again sells and wraps the story of our relationship."
It is also "poor" that the 16-year-old joint son of Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and the revolutions that mean a separation for each child."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid has been remarried and recently father of twins.
And then his admissions with the page title, "My life goes on anyway.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's going well."
prices for air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even cheaper, according to a current study, up to 50 percent.
Flights and nights in hotels have become more favourable - this is the result of a study by the American Express Travel and Financial Service provider.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, following an increase in prices in the first quarter, found a significant break in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays have already taken place in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of 48 European cities surveyed still increased by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
Most clearly, the trend in Paris and Rome was where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
For this reason, American Express sees the weak dollar course that led to a "absorbing travel of American tourists".
Financial spots such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices increase by 26.3 percent even hold the record in Europe.
The trend in the first quarter also showed above:
Because of the kerosene pollution, passengers in the economy class had to pay more than 7.1 percent than 2007, fuel intensive long-range flights were even 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for ticket tickets from the Economy class decreased by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class prices changes were significantly lower.
In Germany, prices were even stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March prices increased by 11.9 per cent, they decreased by 23.6 per cent in the second quarter.
According to the study, the prices were even half the price on German domestic flights.
On the one hand, the company explains the reason for the price collapse is the resulting economic growth.
The demand in many segments of the flight market is broken.
On the other hand, the Open-Skies Agreement, which liberalises air transport between the USA and Europe, has increased competition pressure.
Signs of the tense situation were the route of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that registered the first half of 2008 competition - only in Europe, these were 24 airlines.
HSV hit Gladbach 1:0
With a door and simple methods, the Hamburger SV Tablet leader.
At Borussia, Luhukay was still unable to find a functioning Elf.
From Kristoff's Klein, breaking landing for national players Marko Marin is expanding.
The gladbacher only got into the game late and stepped down with a liver on the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she went convincingly over his lips.
He knew he was right.
"We need the second door," said Hermann Rieger in the cabin passage of the Hamburg Arena.
Many were not left in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most were sitting back in their seats.
Rieger was an HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades, and he enjoyed a higher reputation than a man who was a very shy actor.
And so his request also found hearing in a responsible position.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nicked and lifted the thumb accordingly.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief coach Martin Jol.
Its command is similar: Here with two doors!
The implementation remained unimplemented.
"There wasn't everything to look at today," Marcel Jansen later added.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have "successful desire".
The 1:0 (1:0) have to thank the hamburgers for the Mladen Petric's headball match (11); and the fact that very weak gladbacher could not hurt the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol together.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the viewers celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the arena and the flashboards on the video wall that presented their association as class premiere.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to sort this out," said Marcel Jansen.
He notes that the tableware is more for the incompatibility of the league than for the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late mandatory access - Brazilian Neves and Silva, Torschütz Petric and Jansen rejected by the FC Bayern - is slow but still unable to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," Jol demanded.
After the vote
On Wall Street, the fear is gone.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package temporarily broke the Dow Jones by 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss within a day in his history.

The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs amounted to almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, Grand Investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be provided for the purchase of so-called false mortgages.
However, the sum should not be paid at any rate, but in a step-by-step manner.
On the contrary, the State should receive a stock option card from financial corporations that could be redeemed in the event of appropriate rate developments in order to reduce the burden on the State funds.
Stock exchange rates in Europe and the USA in the bottom floor
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not resolve the doubts of investors.

The stock markets went into the knee all over the world.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the $700 billion heavy rescue package of the US government could not be sufficient to reinstate the financial markets.
The dow lost in the first trading hour 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809,25 points.
The US House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, which could follow the vote in the Senate on 1 October.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London the FTSE index was first given by 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.

Dark matter affects flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been responsible for researchers for inadvertentness: Dark matter has influenced the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by-manover.
Experts fear that the general relativity theory, Albert Einstein, could not be quite correct.
Almost 18 years ago, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
Because of soon-frozen fuel pipelines, you are now threatened with cold death.
For years scientists have provided a mysterious phenomenon for confusion - the swing-by-anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flightover of space probes, where they receive additional vibrations in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Research Sonde Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Sun Sonde Ulysses.
What the researchers have been surprised at, however, for years: the air carriers do not behave 100 percent as expected by the ancient gravitational law.
Much more is involved in irregularities in the speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general relativity theory Albert Einstein, which describes the attractiveness of matter through a distortion of space, could not be quite correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing-by-anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have invented in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
Of the existence of the dark matter, space researchers have known only for about ten years.
It is obviously an attractive force whose effect on other celestial bodies can be seen.
It itself is completely invisible, that is, it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
After the calculations of the scientists, the dark matter still makes good one-fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists who have been dragged into Egypt will be released again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The exporters from Sudan had asked for several million Euros.
Six hostages were to be killed in a firefight before the release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Remuneration negotiations are already under way.
Germans have always returned to the vision of Kidnappern.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists who have been dragged into the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arabic TV channel Al-Arabia and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports of the Italian TV broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We're just checking her health condition," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian, and their eight Egyptian companions, were well and safe, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants in a desert expedition will be on their way to Cairo.
Clearly, the reasons for a shooting continued to remain unclear before the hostages were released: hence, the kidnappers were prepared to kill six of the kidnappers, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," the officer said.
It was "just gone to receive the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the kidnappers and caught two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday.
The hostages had demanded a six-million-euro ransom from Germany; the money should be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" called on a German mediator to delay the release of the hostages because the kidnappers feared their safety.
According to the report, the exporters want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be detained for as long as the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Misuse of the stepfather "leaded to suicide"
The prolonged abuse by her stepfather led to the death of a woman, a court was reported.
Michael Treise, 57, from Stithian, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after he had committed eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Court of Justice in Truro found that he regularly held his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle as she was between five and seven years old.
Treise wrote in a statement: "I feel responsible for her death."
The Court found that Mrs Randle moved to her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Treise had tied her eyes together before committing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a guesthouse.
Treise and his wife separated in the 1980s and moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the Court found that Mrs Randle, who worked for a large part of her time in respect of the National Trust, was persecuted for abuse which she had been added twice a week.
State attorney Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs Randle, who had been an efficient surfer and biker, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had given up her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she died by stabbing herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of understanding, saying, "I cared to tie her up and tie her eyes."
"I didn't need them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Justice Christopher Elwen said to Treise: "They are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been scary for her sacrifice, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would be brought before the court if she had not done so."
He added: "I am aware of the effects that Stephanie's father and mother had on her daughter over the years, according to the description of her father and mother.
Otherwise, she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
For lost data, the official responsible is charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet officer who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June will be charged under the Public Security Act.
The man was seconded by the Ministry of Defence when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "They would have thought that this would have been the case within the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be named shall be charged, in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, with the clause relating to the safe storage of information.
The Royal Public Prosecutor recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he submitted included classified reviews about Al-Quaida and the capacities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was brought from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies see B&B costs in the eye
Following the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank, British housing companies could cost more than 80 million pounds in the house.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies receiving the money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director General of the Housing Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "inconvenient", that the companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loans will finally be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are paid.
However, the interest accrued in the interim will be calculated each year for those 700 financial corporations that accept deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies are included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted prudently ... are now called to take over some of the costs of those institutions that were far less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company had to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together had to pay around 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on the loan will be up to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies have to acquire 81 million pounds for the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Housing Association, told the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted prudently during the property increase will now be called up to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less careful.
According to the BSA, no company has been damaged since the recording in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 interest rates will fall for a full year and that could almost double that much.
Since construction companies are both non-citizen organisations, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or by lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five Pence per litre
The people on Jersey are confronted with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre of Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after an investigation of a consulting company has been carried out.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey Milk was changed last year in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh rejects bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a request for bail from former Prime Minister Scheich Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defenders said that the Court of Justice refused to have pressured 50 million Taka ($729,700) on the prosecution by a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released this month against bail.
Sheikh Hasina was to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Avami Alliance, demanded that the military-supported transitional government grant her unlimited freedom first.
The correspondents say that, although their detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the context of their release whether they will be able to remain free when they return to Bangladesh.
Your lawyers state that they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court's decision.
"The upper court has denied Sheikh Hasina's bail because it says she has not received any bail because she is already on prison leave abroad to be dealt with abroad," said lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a complaint against the upper court."
Your lawyers insist that they need bail to return from abroad to the country in order to prepare for the December elections.
It was expected that Sheikh Hasina would return home after October 17th, said an Avami-Bondi's chairman on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over power, but in June she was released from prison to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia lie to each other.
Fears of the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-Polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence brought about by the Taliban, as the United Nations.
Last week, the United Nations implemented an immunization programme in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN speaker, this was the case despite the promise of the Taliban that thousands of people who were not involved in the vaccinations were not being attacked or prevented.
BskyB loses appeal in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost its complaint against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share of the competing ITV broadcaster.
The Competition Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that the share of BskyBs distorts competition and enables it to have an indirect influence on the ITV broadcaster.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by re-named NTL, now in Virgin Media, successfully inhibited the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB would raise doubts as to the independence of ITV, which the Competition Commission has moved to start an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communications Office Ofcom have spoken against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and excessive measure, in particular because BskyB had announced that it wanted to give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the US Public Prosecutor's Office
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special prosecutor to deal with the termination of the nine state prosecutors in the United States in 2006.
The case was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticised.
The report criticised the officials of the Weissen House, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that lawyers were suspended for political reasons.
Special Agent Nora Dannehy will now discuss whether the officers interviewed during the investigation have angels to prevent justice.
Serious assumptions including criminal proceedings have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The profession of a specialist with the authority to force witnesses to speak was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Ministry of Justice in December 2006 received nine US state prosecutors from their offices.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be dismissed on the basis of weak work.
However, it was later found that the released state prosecutors were not worse judged than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to view the announcements as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others had refused to investigate the allegations of the election fraud of the Democrats.
U.S. U.S. state prosecutors are hereby ordered to investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be suspended for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Advocate General Alberto Gonzales, has come under arrest because of the dismissals and has ultimately reduced his office.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also announced.
In particular, the report by the Inspector-General addressed the role of Gonzales by having the "main responsibility" for the redundancies, having given up his leadership role and had shown himself to be "extraordinaryly disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including former CEO Bush Karl Rove, were criticised for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat praise's epic song to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honoured during the music award "Q Award" for its epic Hymne "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, the next week in London, will accept his special gold price during the award, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's Hitler album from 1977.
"Coldplay" marks the nominations for the award of the award this year after it has come into four categories in the narrower selection.
The editor of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there were some songs that go beyond such matters as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" was certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman demanded a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in 1979 as a single in Britain and reached place 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heart beat after he broke up in the stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to an acute cold-fighting process.
Later it was known that he had a bite on his voice belt.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possible soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, alone, side roads and other surrounding roads, some of which are famous and others are only comfortable.
However, it is even difficult for experienced taxi drivers and long-term residents to say where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This small street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street to North between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching the Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty gas than a actively used road.
There are no road signs either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road plan.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants to reflate Extra Place to create a clean journey to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
The other tenants are part of the long-standing neighborhood, which says they are fascinated by the short gas, simply because it is one of the rest of the past of the house block.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in obtaining them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Municipality this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay have put forward a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the Committee prefers that the road remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be submitted in the coming month, says Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the municipality 3.
"Only very little space has remained in the city's possession and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"It could offer how to repair the road and operate what Avalon could do, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small street would set up new floors and seats, which were designed for a café, to which the company would like to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker from Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but it didn't want to own them necessarily.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this lost gas and make it a public meeting point," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Building Protection Department, thought that it was actually the city's desire to sell the road and stressed that the department's task was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to his colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of his historical impressions.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802, when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow country was not challenged by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk monument closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is certainly most known as the cover for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scraps, lumps and parts of fibers, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public property should remain as modest as it is.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rareness – a practically unaltered divider of the city that should be allowed to rest.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (titled "The Book of Complaints: A bitter nostalgic view of the dying city"), published a part of the city story story about Extra Place, which was published in the journal "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, at that time wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow sac gas that remains dark even over the day and is marked by the metal doors of the warehouse halls, closed windows and on raindrops past flying week-old newspapers."
With few exceptions, the road looked just like this recently at an evening.
A rat came through the back of the road, not far from the door, which led to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing business.
Graffiti were visible on the walls and an empty bottle of beer was not far from a fresh bundle of sorted newspapers.
Some passengers said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished up.
Fields added that, according to his opinion, some people underestimated the journey of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp and noble.
Debates of the European Parliament: Education in English
In this edition of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, head of scientific staff in California Studies and head of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as well as you think: Why the middle class needs a school choice".
Addressing the Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barack Obama's suggestions on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions "the probability of afro-American and Hispanic students to finish school successfully, lower than white students" - which is correct.
In order to close this distance of performance, Obama's education plan recommends, among other things, a two-lingual transition phase in training for those who first learn English.
Nevertheless, Obama’s question is whether his use of bilingual training, which places the emphasis on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing distance in schoolwork.
Take, for example, "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
Most of the students are Spanish and come from families with low income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
In 2008, however, a surprising 100 percent of the fourth grade students held the state examination in Mathe on a good level.
Also surprising were 93 percent of the children from the fourth year of school in the English exam as well.
This amazing success was achieved by other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on review and exercise, on continuous control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach that training is taking place in an English-speaking environment. That is exactly the point Obama should take into account, so schoolmaster Linda Mikels.
This approach places value on the almost exclusive use of English in teaching.
Mrs. Mikels, who rejected the idea of two-language training, told me that the school would have a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later you would enter the classroom and no longer be able to recognize him.
"It works," she noted, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The services of the school would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within its own party (the national educational associations have been supporting the idea of dual-language education for a long time) and its own consistent support of dual-language education make predictions about Obama's response uncertain.
While agreeing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the "English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can Spanish."
If Obama actually wants to close the distance of performance, he should carefully consider the training models that work instead of denying them and trivializing them.
The price of oil decreases as a result of further fears about the economy
The oil price is high on Monday because of the fears that even the US rescue plan for the financial markets could not be sufficient to revitalize the economy.
The raw oil terminals at the New York Trade Exchange fell by 7 per cent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shielded from both the financial turbulence on the Wall Street and the strong waves in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices in July reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel, they fell to almost $90 per barrel this month to increase again as a result of huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors were once again concerned, although congress representatives had announced that they would have agreed to a rescue plan on the weekend, which should be the biggest in history.
This message was overestimated by new concerns that the financial crisis has not yet been completed.
In the first chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government statement on Monday, the Citigroup is expected to buy out the banks of the Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial groups Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, it seems that despite the intense negotiations that took place in the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it did not succeed in experiencing the mood on the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
Analysts from the German Bank have written in a communication to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe that they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the commodity markets, we are mostly concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially in China."
The bank's analysts adjusted their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the following year and reduced their oil and gas prices by 20% for 2009.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Integrating Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he had lived in the last eight and a half years more often than any other in the Jets triangle.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter in which the jets turned a resultless game into a triumphal draw.
"That's what I've never seen," Ellis said.
After a clever game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect rise to a afternoon on which their developing cooperation made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this area for two more touchdowns, which once broke out as an outside defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I wasn't particularly stressed," says Coles about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a superplayer.
Our vote has been voted, no matter what people think."
While playing Favre and Coles prisoners, the defense took Quarterback Kurt Warner apart.
Externally defensed Darrelle Revis started a disappointed throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and started him.
Linebacker David Bowens then took care of a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced by Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had won the ball with another 10 seconds in the game when the jets took the ball back and Jay Feelly turned a 20-yard shot to 34 to 0 leadership.
These were the most points the jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets replied, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the two answers, because the jets left 21 points in the third quarter without a single one, Mangini said: "Trust me, I have enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points have been achieved in a short time."
Exhibited Bracelet Beats His World Record
Hail Gebrslassia from Ethiopia has shown again why some keep him for the best long distance of all time, after he broke his own record on Sunday in Berlin Marathon and became the first person to make it 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course at 2:03:59, Gebrselasia improved its previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrslassie, 35, has thus established his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has reached at least one world championship title or a world record on each track from one kilometer to the Marathon.
Last month, Gebrselsia left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing out of fear that air pollution might worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the Berlin competition.
In almost perfect conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at start and 13 degrees at target - have won a gearbox with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since train runners such as Gebrslassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed on long distances, the record time for Marathon in the last 10 years has fallen for more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, he reported to the press that he had two weeks ago had seizures in his Wade and therefore could not train for a week.
Apparently he has been refreshed after a break and has not returned to rest.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything is perfect.
I took the training back a week ago and I had some more concerns today, but at the end, everything was great."
He has been criticised for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - that he is excessively orchestrated, many of the world's best Marathonstars generally feel that he relys too much on the racers as if it were a race, and a world record on the competition.
However, this criticism does little harm the size of the germination glasses as long-term runners.
With four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselasia reached the center of the route at 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai, and Charles Kamathi have continued to challenge gebrsselase after the tempomas left.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselasia made his last entry to separate from Kwambai, which came as second at 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third at 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Deutsche, has completed a remarkable year by showing at 2:19:19 the fastest result of all times.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the United Kingdom.
Last spring the 36-year-old Mikitenko had won the London Marathon by surprise at 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing due to problems described as rear injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon for five minutes.
She had planned her course by leaving a quarter of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to travel, but only 30 kilometres away.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became second at 2:21:31, while Helena Cyprus arrived from Kenya as a third at 2:25:01.
The pride and the traps in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hiding between the expansions of leisure parks around Orlando, a few miles away from the glittering, loud and gigantic drives, there is a quiet city in which the pride and complications of African-American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the home city Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet squares, 300 brown hides, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guaven, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it's a pilgrim's place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of Harlem Renaissance.
And yet it is and remains the city it describes – and it made it a tourist destination by taking it into the Florida Travel Guide, which was produced at the time of the depression of the federal writer project – in many respects a place of very special variety.
Eatonville is so independent, dazzling and private as in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "so little knows about us that he doesn't know what's going on with him."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, called for an open debate on racial relations, many are still sorry to be observed by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a community member of the oldest church of the city.
There must be a vote."
Eatonville has long been defined as the paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is a historical example of the black movement as well as a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
On the one hand, it is a capital of literature and on the other hand an example of - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south that has its roots in the American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on the hat.
And so rightly the concerns about Eatonville's image began with Zora, as all Hurstons here call it.
She introduced the world to her hometown in books that came from hearts and were written in mouth, as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida Travel Guide changed the city, which lies very close to Route 77, a road leading through the often forgotten centre of Florida to the shadows of black history and human drama.
Frech and Oskar both in real life and in literature, Hurston reader led to the loading of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"Besides the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown, well-browned modern school, with its planted gardens and playgrounds, which always takes care of Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of Witwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks of any kind and what-so-ever fits in hourly rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston thus linked Eatonville with self-esteem, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
I'm sure this wasn't a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
"Zora described the things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls lived the Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty that were full of sexual toys.
She added, "Many people don't like this."
You still remember Hurtson here as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came to town, she did this mostly without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that today pictures something on her precious style of dress.
According to Mr Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, but many of them despised them.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added, while he was staring in his chair, on a terrace behind the Sabelia Lake, in which the Hurston of all probability was baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and buried her books.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there were no great memorials, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution in the world or their legacy in the wild," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to lay a five-track highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-track main road of the municipality.
Orlandos Voororte had already pushed the 4th motorway through the western edge of the city.
The proposal was presented when Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in his history.
Compulsory integration, among other things, had put an end to the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the Community.
"In this time a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and soap on the people who were sitting aside," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston demanded that the Supreme Court require integration by calling for Brown to be "respective of my race" in the case of the school council.
People today say that although the lifting of the racial separation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group's cohesion in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember it - they hugged their teachers in the morning and hugged their teachers in the evening," says N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville Community.
This could be maintained for so long, added them until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"I didn't hug his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural struggle," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who have gone about prejudices, as they have done, with positive self-consciousness and saying, "How can anyone deny the joy of my society?
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker made his way to Hurston's unnamed grave and began to fight for the restoration of her fame.
Five years later, a very popular Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookstores, and she again became a part of the American literary canon.
The road project came just at a time when the most famous daughter in Eatonville was once again in public light.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-track road inhabited the city, accelerated the whole with peak speed, sparked real citizens' shocks," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said something simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the road project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
There came more and more journeys, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been in the church since 1993, and locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was incorporated into the national historical register in 1998.
A new single library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly embellished and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a specialty in Florida: only 6 miles from the city centre of Orlandos can sometimes feel like a back gas in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is today 90% black.)
Externalists looking for the history of Eatonville and its importance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, a prior approval is necessary and certain things - like the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a wiseman and represented by black men at field work - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that their protected community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival grew, an increased degree of homestead was also born.
Above all, young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their whole race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither bad nor better and just as proud, creative and jubilant, alber and blends through like any other group of races and peoples in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who went back to Eatonville College to work in the city administration or in the police who could use some help, according to him.
And even the young, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who just go through here will think, "But this city is nothing compared to all the others," Alondra Kenon said recently on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, you talk about financial latrine.
At first glance nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from newspapers and violent TV screens in Times Square, they would not notice that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that their heads, in the shoe-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the Monopol in New York have the worst horror working day ever since 1929.
The suppliers still slide the metal tea scales along the citizens' stairs and carry tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latinos still wander between apartments, like human packers loaded with the 50 curved T-shirts hanging on a jock-like pole lying on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting for food on the citizens' stairs on their breakfast bag and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 16 and 19 hours.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until I decided on Thursday afternoon to open a new savings account because of all the world's intervention.
Although I decided to place my duty on the late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase Family Branch, about 20 people were already standing.
Not to raise or deposit money on the money switch, but to the customer service switch where customers order cheques, tourists ask for the way to Macy's shop and where to open new customer accounts.
Most of the time, I later learned from Starr, my "personal bank employee with license", stood for the same reason as I did.
Unlike me, however, they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, in places from which they were commuting, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from the so-called trifles (a little similar to a building park), social banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state and say they treat their customers as family.
Last year, 15 of these banks were silent and silent.
In the last few days Washington Mutual, a bank with facilities of $327 billion, in competition management over and as last Friday of New Yorker went home for the weekend, was Wachovia, another bank with a savings facility worth $440 billion, looking for a life-saving buyer.
In the fear of another raid, the office and shopkeepers who stood before me brought their bar to a bank that is viewed as a safe port, a bank that is responsible for most of the purchases on Wall Street.
Quite normal New Yorkers have adapted to the current financial latrine in the last few weeks.
A woman who telephoned in my Chinese supermarket took so much confidence in Lehman Brothers, the bank that went to the court and its deposed CEO Dick Full, as if she would be reading about a false colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my living block, has come from our usual entertainment themes about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"Now I have all my savings in money market funds" she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking any risks anymore."
Muslemic graves broken during the legal run in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing director of the Austrian Right Party of Freedom of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian Right Pertei Vlaams Belang, participates in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, to represent the organization "Citys against Islamism".
They wear signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed with a red line.
The police accused law-extremists of excrement at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, and on the same weekend, they recorded significant gains at the extreme right party in the country's parliamentary election.
In the night of Friday to tomorrow, more than 90 miners at the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in an organized action, according to the police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Star on some of the graves, but criminal officials hold this as an attempt to obscure the motive of the extremists driven by hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the event is in any way associated with the elections.
One speaker of the local Islamic community said she was "extensively scared" about the message of the burial that took place when the religious month of Muslim Ramadan turns to the end.
At the same time, there is a round of conscience research in Austria after the country in the election of the elected Parliament to the right.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, which received almost 30% of the votes from the two far right-wing parties, joined in their campaign for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of its election languages were criticised as being foreign.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, took part in a ban on headaches and burkas and even witnessed his refusal to food that is generally associated with Islam.
In his last speech in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosques and minerals with the argument that these political symbols of continuous Islamism are Austria and Europe.
Investigations and analyses carried out immediately after the election and stating that the extreme rights of the political strongest bloc in the country are indicated that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel block for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam Rockstar convicted of child sexual abuse, was ordered to travel to France and Spain in court.
Glitter set up a six-month suspension after informing the authorities that informed him about it, he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The police in Kent were granted a ban on foreign travel on Thursday after presenting evidence to the judges of Glitter's pre-trial punishment for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Court of Justice in Kent, but was represented by the Attorney General Cork Binning.
EIN spokesperson of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday, 25 September, police Kent, at Ashford's Court of Justice, asked for permission to prevent travel abroad from Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not present in person."
According to the register for sexual offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a five-year prison sentence.
The police in Kent said they wouldn't discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible place of residence in the country.
A spokesperson for Kent's Police Unit said: "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the highest concern of the police in Kent to protect the citizens of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual offenders in the country to minimize any risk that might exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter fled to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to fly to London.
But he said he didn't feel comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through the passport and he fled for one and Her to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused his entry and fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Finally, on August 22, he arrived in Heathrow at Terminal 3 and stayed there during his legal counsel David Corker went to Uxbridge's court in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter was arrested in 1999 for 4 months in the United Kingdom because of the possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was calmed and satisfied that Glitter had been stopped to travel to France and Spain.
`I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character’, Günter brewer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no Russ, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the large flamencotenders who refuse to concentrate and devote themselves to the interpretation to gain a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
One-sided artist
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, in these moments that are foreign to the public, I know when I can find for the personality typical gestures, the depth of a stolen glance or expression of the hands that are concerned because they are not going to enter the stage.
In his project 'Flemenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents varied theatres on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this page he was still not known to the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flame-code display at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the programme of the month of photography of the Flamenco, 'respects the international importance of Flamenco, which is growing from day to day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that 'Flemenco-people' may be any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical pictures of artists on stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sorrow, joy and so move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures on stage.
Her personality and character are in her heart.
What I was interested in was creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the biggest flamencomers with the camera.'
A farmer, inspired by the festival 'Cante de las Minas', went on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images have been created that remind you of classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, thereby giving the image the modernity and the idea, as the peasant Flamenco understands: `music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
This is not only the dance, the song, or the instrumental play, but the personality of the artist, his character, which with his art seduces the audience.
The search for the essential, for something that becomes visible in the form of the ear, of the being, is and was the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of the El Fotómata.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the narrow selection of almost seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project became an anthology of the flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea two years ago and to carry out the "portrait of the veterans of the sport" ('SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project 'Flemenco-people' are different, I like the photographer very much to photograph the people, to know them and to move me in their state of life, whether for a short time or for a longer time.
I think in the field of photography, the portrait is the most difficult type.
You meet people, people you sometimes don't even know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of the flamenco portraits of today with the title 'Flemenco-people' is shown in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located on the street with the name la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hercules. The exhibition can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says that the Rome he just writes is "a great crowd."
He does not yet know where the Roman's action is taking place and what is going on there, but Mario Vargas Llosa is trying hard to advance the project he is working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in Congo for 20 years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia Festival, the favorite Nobel Prize winner added that the project he is dealing with is 'a great festival' and 'everything indicates that he did not have to write the novel'.
'If I could have, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel sometime', so he concluded his participation at the festival where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La stadt y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the prize of the Hay Festival and who gave most of the audience their voice, is compared to the old edition of 'Our mutual friend' and is seen in the theater Juan Bravo.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo, and noted that he had a audience before him, who noticed that the Peruvian, who had a wonderful memory and great sense of humor, had not been given enough time to go through all of this: how his vocation for literature was created, which came from ‘extraordinary adventure desire’, from ‘peace on reading’ and from ‘more to experience’ than before; how he writes and ‘discipline’ to complement `the lack of inspiration’, his intensive work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions that he does; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what `discipline' are the foundations of his stories.
The Hispano American novelist argued that there is no way of measuring where and how to know whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an experiential experience', stresses Vargas Llosa, who claims that it brings out 'effects' and 'people even more apart', so I asked the writers 'not to abandon the ease' and 'to take responsibility' for his calling 'over'.
At the party in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: Styrian champions fell partly.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the bullfight with which the festival should be concluded in Pozoblanco was to be held in the morning.
So the organizer, with the agreement of Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to move the star competition.
Thus, the festival of unstoppable weather was exposed, so two of the three festivals could not be held.
On Saturday it was raining why the second scheduled bullfight could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group was composed of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who entered the bullfights on and off.
That's the only way that there was a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after whom he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than by his starry art.
And even worse was El Juli, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, most of the audience responded to his second fight with Buh-Rufen.
In Álava, two persons wanted to leave the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand Kilo Haschisch.
Tomorrow: five minutes before ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon (Ålava).
Two policemen called on the car drivers to stop, which led them to escape.
It seemed that with the loading of more than two thousand kilo hashish, they should not stop.
The police followed her and found one of the drivers, the 28-year-old man known as A.A.J., as reported by the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic officers of the Alava region had already completed traffic control at N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to run the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to get out of control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped after a few kilometers on the edge of the road. At the moment, the drivers stepped out of the car to fly across a road in a forest area.
The city police finally seized one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, drug dealers transported 2,178 Kilo Haschisch, which was seized by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with Haschischbindels, which were later led to the precise laboratory analysis and to the balance of the bundle to other police stations.
The officials also found that the mark was `double', so that it did not match the marks in the Kfz papers, and that was why an additional arrest was carried out because of the error of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigations to investigate the arrest of the second suspect who, as mentioned above, could flee, but also to identify the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old A.A.J. was taken to a police station for arrest.
The actor Heather Lockler was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
The actor Heather Lockler, known for the role of Amanda in the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
A Witness observed how she tried to get out of her car accident in Montecito in a rather unusual way, spokesmen of the California traffic police told the magazine 'People'.
The Witness told in detail that Locklear `after 16:30 p.m. expressed the gaspedal and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forth from the parking lot, and when she drove back, she stuck several times on her sunglasses."
A little later, the witness saw that the actress probably did not know at first that Lockler was on a nearby road and went out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had `Angst lived around Locklears'.
When the police arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which was standing on the street and blocking traffic.
'They seemed to be unoriented', so they brought the police into a special drug and alcohol center to make a test.
According to one police speaker, the actor showed himself to be cooperative, excessive alcoholism was excluded from the first moment. `The first observations of officials as a result, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug," said the speaker.
Locklear was suspected of driving under the influence of an indefinite substance that could not be determined, and brought to a local investigator by 19 hours.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released after treatment from a clinic in Arizona, where she was treated with anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and members of the United Left, today has ensured that the Regional Association for Education will be the one who will take the decision in the case of the former Council for Youth and Sport of the Council in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who was retired last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
'In such cases I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be those who must take responsibility for it', Llamazars pointed out what action the party must have in relation to which until now sits as a council in the municipality of Seville.
Nevertheless, the president of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the violations of the rules that Silva could have begun: 'The VL always insisted that such cases should be given maximum transparency'.
In this regard, he stressed that education has a strict ethical code for all public offices.
'Sangre de mayo': Heldenbuch von Garci
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in 'Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous Spanish rebellion against the French. This is a wonderful film in filmography, with about 15 million euros of investment for spinning works.
In this way, the cinema has tried to present a lot of personalities and social analysis, which he has always admired in the works of the famous Roman writer, Carci explained today in the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of the performers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday is presented in cinemas and later shown on the broadcast telemadrid as a four-hour ministry.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that thanks to his work, he went into fulfillment. He thanked Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the autonomous community Madrid to film a memorial to the second century festival in Madrid on 2 November. Especially because the story is based on the basis of "Episodios Nationales", he accepted the assignment.
The total contribution of 15 million made by the Madrid autonomous community for rotational work, Garci, as he added, offers the ‘one-time possibility’ with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing the image of the ‘confused Spain’ who sought the false leader for the fight because the people had been abandoned by the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand VII.’
However, the cinematist regrets that with funding such as 'Alatriste' or 'Los phantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as 'Sangre de Mayo'), some scenes from the spinbook with Horacio Valčarcel, with which Garci worked almost all his career, could not be turned.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in `Volver a empezar', has been involved in his usual way of working: he focused on the stage with the actors with whom to try first to turn and for those who did not casting, he appeared 'depressive' and respect, `part of the director's profession is to provide help in the theater and cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which you work.'
Many of the performers he runs in 'Sangre de Mayo' must repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larranñaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he has won one), is the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de Mayo', nor 'Siete meas de billar francés' nor the selected film `Los girasols cigos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
`In the beginning you believe that you are working for the offspring, later you notice that it is only for virtues, and now you are satisfied if you have produced a film,’ Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón calls back the dancer from Sevilla Tortola Valencia
A flamencotender from Seville honors a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother, Andalusierin (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert in Oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian and set herself up for the abolition of the corset, which limited the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left behind her traces of dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which was impossible for me."
'We're not trying to tell you about her life, but to keep her spirit,' said the flamer.
Your dance bases have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
"The dance of the schmetterling" came to me, for example, like Guajira, or "the dance of the snake" like Tango.
Her dance was sensible and I was told that my dances are also in this aesthetic field," she claims.
The stage consists of two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in 'La porta aberetta'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
`Matilde plays Tortola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to be involved in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The stage also includes musical composition and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the song of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Juarez, he `overtakes the role of the companion of the artists, the divas in which he always fell in love again.'
In this work we also tell a certain way of life of this woman, who was known in such places as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she normally lived in London.
'I wanted to call her back in memory, because I think she's one of the women who have a huge influence on a certain age and whose works are no longer known and therefore they're even less appreciated,' says Bayón.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 in the theatre Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta reincarado' also includes the trienium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta reen cadado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married 1916 Zenobia, offers a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the 'Trienium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The goal is to remember the 50th anniversary of the award of the literary Nobel Prize and the death day of both.
"The Trienium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" will be concluded with the new edition of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the hiking exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: "Aquel chopo de lus", which was opened in May and after it was held in different places in Andalusia, New York is now reached and presented in the course of the International Congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Dario de un poeta reincadado', which were published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The goal is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet better known.
Without Paul Newman, the United States can hardly imagine itself.
'Many times God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.'
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in the "sensation reporter" and from the then dominant performance of the American cinema, which was released in the paper, from all over America to Newman, with his exciting performance and followed her.
Now, look what it cost him to lend Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a great blow to everyone.
'What one feels at times is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,' said Robert Redford crying, 'my life and my country were the greatest nightmares of his life.'
No one was afraid to laugh or overstep.
As the 'father' of the cinema and the country, he died in a sad moment, in fear of terrorists and the collapse of the market, in which the depressed self-esteem of the U.S. is on the hopeless search for reasons to maintain dignity.
If in this hard time without duty only a few people who can be admired remain, then you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he incorporated almost a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as well as various losses: from the foundation that directed itself to the fight against drugs and to honor his son from the first marriage, who died at overdose, was founded up to his own brand of home-made and organic products.
This is all a gift for the country in which it took a lot of effort to carry out itself against a deadly food culture.
A wide range of surprises is worth taking home Hollywood without regard to nationality and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar Prize winner, said that working with Newman was no more or less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, was waiting to be called Newman's greatest inspiration.
'We have left the greatest of us all,' said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today are trying to live faithful as Paul Newman lived: getting high demands on justice, a responsible private life, leading far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example.
He was divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although there were certainly not many possibilities.
‘Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have a file at home?’ he often screamed himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily usual in America.
'Of all the great roles that he played, he was not as proud as the faithful husband, the loving father, the attentive father, and the Philanthropic,' they said.
The streets in Madrid are lacking for the Olympic games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some of the Olympic disciplines in Madrid after the 2012 failure, but it may be 2016.
But I ask myself, 'Are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
It was described as the perfect road, and after my assessment, it was the worst road with everything through and through that there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense if you were to observe the evaluation and I could check it, that would clearly not happen.
But let's go through from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the tickethole that allows you to go as first.
I don't think it's bad either, but if they let you go, they should also give you everything (including chip to avoid the strain on the street).
So don't.
Here they let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that exists there only to go there) and (after an infinite waiter) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where are we actually living?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts from less fabric?
So good, things like these are a little compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting line of at least 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
The waiting lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was also expected, the road began and we had not left our backpacks before, even if it had succeeded once, but it would be harder to recover.
It also looked to rain in this 40-minute waiting period, so it came to the attempt to organize a riot of the people and to invade the houses.
I think in the morning some 500 people will certainly have lung inflammation and some like me will not appear in time for the classification because of this chip I have received, I can already think that the exit was mismarked.
Of course, if you asked me about a perfect road, this road would never affect me.
So I think we're going to dream for a long time from a city that's well prepared for the Olympic games.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', held by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft it is a route planner to move on the company's campus).
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, these 'receptionists' can recognize how many people are in space, who they are, and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the key words of their entertainment.
It can also bring the members into the groups after the talks.
In the presentation video, "the receptionist" notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group that conducts her conversation, and that he is also not a company employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will be heard soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
That's definitely the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked very superficially about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computer were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling it with the commercial waste, it would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will be only for the poor.
Everything is just a statement when you think that Microsoft added some function and `Extras' in Windows versions.
The change in direction is worth it.
Microsoft has the right, the operating system loses its weight all the time, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared in the network, it was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Sends a lot of people to point out that the browser is not a operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary so that hardware and software can work at the same time.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to sharing something with his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People give less attention every time to the operating system, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to perform the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome, and every day we spend more time on surfing than in the 'window' environment.
What is the use of half in the computer of existing applications?
Less Than
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
The interest of Microsofts is more about integrating its online services, which can then become the alternative to Google.
In fact, they need it, no doubt, I'll give you a little example.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refresher drinks automat is a sign: `Your search. Our future'. It prints a letter to use its own online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of the employees at Microsoft used Google for research in the network.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has arrived late.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso held it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `Der Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it is part of the clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we begin to count the countless star performances, we can go back to the image of a very powerful man, with a sharp bart, who had raised weight in a hiking circus.
In fact, it is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, without sleeves and trilled.
The English-speaking people call it 'tank'. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, exceeds all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is named in the narrow circle `Marcel'. The legend tells that the name stand is related to sport and stems from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the singer’s lover Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' surpasses all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive Unisex cut and is distinguished by a small Belgian flag (unrecognizable) that have these T-shirts as a detail on the neck.
And attention, the Belgian company not only focuses on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and shirts, cotton pants, T-shirts with strips, babies, mini shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's very bad to use them as underwear.
They're very funny.
'I want to be a young mother. I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great performance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is a sightless, but full of life.
At present, the Gruz brothers take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
For Monica, it means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of Mango, leaving her residence and also making the presentation of the most important awards in fashion that sponsors the Spanish fashion show.
Merciful and fearful, winner on short routes.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I had designed for Mango, and I also attended the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and shared the dinner with Valentinos.
A very intense working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, as well as I am fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I would like to go through a city and watch women dress up how they combine their clothes, which I often do.
Dancer, actor and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but finally, everything happens in one area and these areas have many communities.
Since I was little, I was thrilled with the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to get around my aunt's clothing and see her clothes.
It was great to go almost better than to go to a leisure park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to look at the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in teaching and in the samples to look into the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actor, when you get the costume, you move into the real role of the performer.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so much respect for the costume designer and its professionality.
You've been 30 recently, haven't you been in a crisis?
Oh, what.
I feel better than ever, I feel better than thirty years old.
I find that the woman becomes mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've done the things I've been doing since I was little, wanted to do, and this has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking of becoming a mother, aren't you?
For a long time, I have known that I will be a mother, because this is what my body requires and I want to be a young mother; I do not want to let it go.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
I'm going to convey great happiness to my child and bring it up with a lot of love.
With regard to film art, you keep in mind the works you took part in and the last year turned.
That is exactly the case, and I would very much like them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theater, am very impatient and impatient and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that `La last hora' and `En busa de la Tomba de Cristo' will be listed for the first time.
See how you like them.
A couple of days ago, you showed up on the race with Naomi Campbell, right?
If it's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the ladder to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a while, has simply called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the welfare event of her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothing we show. I know that two pieces of clothing from our collection for Mango were raised to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
I, like the one who knows her, would tell you that they don't agree.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing that she is involved in.
She asked me to share in the parade for this great thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a handle, I will do it too.
To support women in the Third World, whatever is necessary.
The drivers who can be returned because of the alcohol level will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for alcohol abuse, installs in his car this system, which prevents him from starting the car in a drunken state. If he is alcoholized, then the car does not jump.
The initiative has already been announced in June last month and is now part of the report of the Attorney-General. According to its information, it is a pilot project that will last a year.
The aim is to resocialize the driver, which is why he is given a course for the conversion of traffic behaviour.
The Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Vehicles will participate in this work, with the exception of the Public Prosecutor-General, with experience.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of the drivers who were shown more than once because of driving under alcohol influence were taxed again.
The 'alcohol' would prevent it because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaust air and prevents the autostart when the driver has made an alcohol test; or when an alcohol concentration is detected which is higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1,000 euros, the costs are borne by those who impose the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices were already preventing up to 65 % of regulatory infringements in the first year following its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to engage in this behaviour before it becomes a crime.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be carried out in the ordinary way, yet a reform of the basic law is required which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still available on the Spanish markets, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
In the morning, the House of Representatives will vote for the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., at the time scheduled for the program, next to the Presidential hangar of the Benito Juárez de México DF Airport, the Spanish Air Force aircraft traveled with the Asturian Prince and Prince.
The sun went down, but their beams had yet to be forced to use their hand as a sunscreen to see the royal pair that got out of the plane.
Direct at Gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and the Prince of Asturias were visiting the city to formalise the official journey.
- Ah, very well, so, you can't take people at the airport around this time you're from here or so
No, she's the Spaniard, but she's lived here for a few years.
- Oh, that's very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and the Prince of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are many who are waiting in hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 soldiers of the Navy, who give the honoursalve.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the Prince, with long hairs wrenched from the wind, without normal 'peep-toes', may have been told that it is expected a wet in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official order is waiting.
At the door of the hotel, where they are accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, awaits a reporter from Mexican TV who likes to joke.
The best premium of fashion
There was probably no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly excellent fashion designers and Bonvivants than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Boton-Mango Fashion Awards' for the promotion and international promotion of young fashioners.
This is awarded with a cash price of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, yesterday saw her drawings in the Mango Branch window at Boulevard Haussmann's 54th in Paris and almost won because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The biggest business is in London.
So many events have happened that you want to thank fashion designer Valentino for his jury presidency at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board of directors organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by pain, because his brother had recently died, got together. He drew the suit from the fashion house and wore some jewelry from ELAH that were stunning. He stood at the arm of his son Luis, who is nearly two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, to his honor.
Andik, the owner and Lord of the House of Mango, welcomed the guests and was such a knight, so he ended up with the Baron of Rotschild without jackets, because Jacketts lent them to the ladies.
Monica Cruz, who had gone to the store and had a dress and a shirt that she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a room for ballet samples, so she got excited, remembered the old times, took a stick and made a sort of 'great pile'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the palace's rooms, but before she showed us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a person who always evoked a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own bed sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, had prayed in advance to have a room with no taste.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Council against stress
There are no 1000, but one more possibility to forget chaotic everyday life.
And even if there are few, they are all collected in a book where there is how to relax. The book comes into the book deals on September 30.
The Weeker is a punishment when he sounds at 7:00 a.m., but the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that requires the current life is worse.
The office is called the voltage and the computer that leads to back pain.
The stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two ways to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of turning off from the world of work.
However, the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga settings, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the full list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called '1001 possibilities to relax' and thus comes the peace that the book conveys in the book deals of the Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who believes that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as the workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual rejects such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered, how to stay in contact with nature or propose the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins is no longer high enough to restore balance of the body and stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to put yourself on the sofa to turn off the brain and concentrate on reading.
Talk in bed
Some children talk at night
I mean, not those who wake up and tell us something about what happened the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case, you will be frightened, but in reality it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called sleep talk.
It is quite widespread, especially among children and young people.
Surely, more than one of you was told that you had talked at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example, during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), on the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason to cause this phenomenon.
Often relationships with other sleep appearances are sought, such as alpine dreams, panic anxiety at night, Enuresis noctura (night's bed), talk in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we mentioned earlier, there may be very high fibers, stress situations or overload.
Anyway, it's a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak in quiet words, whisper or it may be quite a opposite (screaming, wine, long discussions ).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and to consult with a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and thus comes to be.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, unless it is related to another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnoe or with stress).
What can be done is a series of simple prevention measures:
Don't try to get the child to go to sleep.
So, choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are scary and something too wild.
For the nervous children who are recommended to relax, relaxation methods can be used to help them gain some inner calm.
It helps the child to sleep quietly.
If the conversation occurs once in bed, try to keep the peace.
Think of it as harmless for the child and the next day it will be able to remember nothing about what happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you'll get it out of bed.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it relaxes.
Think of it when a couple of appearances seem frightening, it is recommended to consult or find out the reason why the child is afraid.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on to perform a reception and get more information.
So you won't be able to do anything about it, because when the child is asleep, it's unconscious and can't think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says it, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe it doesn't tell the kid that you hear it at night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That causes a lot of fear.
So don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that takes just a few minutes.
Illhouses ... at last
After a long hard drive, Illhouses on the playing field are finally back to a successful course.
Without great effort, the yellow blacks played numerous torso and made it possible to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers were struggling to show their ability, was not very high.
After the first attack of the guest captain Kauffmann, whose remote shot was barely at the corner, Illhausen should easily dominate the game, and it was the first to change the floor with a remote shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot-tip to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and left only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half should be decisive with two Torchancs first fought by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately with the first door for the Illhauser by Marais, who was right to accept again a ball that had been rejected in a first attempt by Diebold.
However, the innkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for a long time and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, so that his crew cameras would continue to play a large number of subjects.
However, Denmark did not know how to use this and did not face any major problems of an Illhaeusian Elf, which only retreated a little, to defend it to 'defense', except in the last seconds of the game, in which the ball was very close to passing through the latte after a great cross.
Sarkozy Meets Angry Fisher
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another abstinent to the British.
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked the access to several British and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to meet with their representatives there on Tuesday morning in the port of Guilvinec in Finistère.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he will come with 'concrete suggestions'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a general meeting of the crisis committee established by the Breton fishermen to carry out measures in view of the extreme increase in the price of diesel, which has reached an average value of over EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the press speaker of the Elyséepalast David Martinon, the President will discuss possible solutions to help their companies to become competitive again, and to ensure the working conditions and the payment of the seamen.'
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning, they launched a protest march in Morbihan and Calvados, causing a staus of almost ten kilometers long.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break off.
The Quiberon peninsula was delimited by a barrier.
Already on Monday, the sailors express their determination by burning them from early morning on tires and pallets before the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc demonstrations were held.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic Coast and the Channel, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing boats do not export, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvre of the commercial ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantic in the evening solved the blockade of the significant total refinery in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec has to decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the national fisheries committee that has not supported their movement.
'The strike will continue', for 'the fishermen will not be noticed at any point' and 'will not go to Paris', for example, said Liliane Cariou, President of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman of the Wonderful
The unforgettable performer from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 following the consequences of cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes agreed to the filmmaker and the dedicated actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
This year, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer counts 215 aircraft delivered, despite the threatening recession, as a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, approved its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, 97 aircraft were delivered by the manufacturer.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects much from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of size range from 30 to 120 seats.
To this day Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times, the American International Group, which was financially supported by the US Monetary Authority, is considering spending more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the 85 billion dollars that were allocated to it.
AIG is willing to direct the sale of a large part of its business, via its international life insurance and its age insurance in the United States.
According to the FT, the AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to review possible sales.
At the AIG, no confirmation could be obtained.
Among the assets that AIG might possibly separate from, are its airline lease branch International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% in the back-up of Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate and its investments in the private equity, the FT further explains.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, FT continues.
AIG must make the most of the sales to repay the loans of 85 billion that it has authorized the Federal Reserve, even at the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and lose the current shareholders to the same extent.
Analysis Historic Paris meeting Historic morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the representative board had rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks, a historical case of the courses: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss of approximately 800 points, and the Nasday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has dropped by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As regards the points, the strongest case of his history (684.81 points) was recorded earlier on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final figure, the Nasdag index, mainly in terms of technology, dropped by 199,61 points to 1,983,73, and the widely distributed Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106,55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to save the banks by the Chamber of Representatives, which should allow for some stability in the markets again, Wall Street, which was already attacked at the beginning of the quarter, broke up.
On the other hand, with 228 votes and 205 votes in favour, the Members rejected the funds he had requested from Finance Secretary Henry Paulson.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
`Here is a bad picture in circulation that makes the Congress unable to adopt a plan,’ said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market was counting on this plan’, added it, and fears that a project 'too late' will come in several days.
‘If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will be the quick task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, Am. d. Red.) and other central banks to get the crisis in the grip, which would limit the credit conditions even more,’ warned Brian Bethune, Head of Economics at Global Insight.
And Ms. Piegza stressed that she highlighted the feeling of extreme urgency even more, 'that every day that she spends on bringing the ruin of a financial company' into the United States'.
After the Washington Mutual competition on Friday, the US authorities planned to purchase Wachovia's banking business through its competitors Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated suddenly and led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets “not only face an American but a global crisis”, added the analysts of the FTN Financial.
The market for basic goods has grown dramatically.
The revenue of the State Fund has fallen from 3,632% in the evening to 3,827% in the last 10 years, and revenue from 4,161% in the evening to 4,357% in the last 30 years.
Obama, winner of points in the first television show
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday followed another to find out who, as the winner of it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory for the choice of both Republicans and Democrats in this television show, which should be followed by one third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite apparent, was not 'brillant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in election questions five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday, according to Obama with five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that democracy makes the better figure clearly.
In the case of the undecided voters, that is, those to whom it is now coming, Obama went out with 39% as the winner of the polls, while according to a CBS survey 25% of them viewed McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his preference on Thursday with the good performance expected by his rival Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but warned this weekend, Bill Clinton.
The seven-year-old McCain did not stop to put his undisputed experience in the field of foreign policy in the foreground, and thus clearly stressing his opponent's 'Naivety' with regard to these issues, which were the focus of this first television show.
'Sentator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...' he stressed several times.
'I do not believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and the necessary knowledge to become president', he also assured.
A point of attack that has been preached in the Republican polls since yesterday.
Obama himself emphasized that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely without getting out of office.
He looked forward to making good decisions and renewing the picture the world has of the United States.
`McCain has still not understood, Obama by the way', this weekend set up a democratic election campaign against the Republican in which it was proposed not to be able to capture the full extent of the crisis imposed on the 'Americans from the street'.
'During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama called on 20,000 people yesterday, who had gathered in a streaming rain on a election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'middle state' or 'worker'. 'The financial crisis provides Obama, who the Americans consider to be the most suitable to save the economy even at the edge of the background, a clear advantage.
'The next week could be a crucial turning point', estimated yesterday by the influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared Obama's 'good economic instincts' with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For democratic candidates, the current crisis is the final part of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Once again he stressed that he would probably even create a reduction in taxes for 95% of Americans, despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, was the top priority for him.
On the other hand, McCain wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates are taking note of the questions raised on the plan to save the financial market of over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was adopted yesterday evening by the Congress and is extremely unpopular to the people.
‘Did you notice that a choice was made in Minsk?’
Youth and opposition protested Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital to deny the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred white Russians gathered on Sunday evening since the closure of the Wahllokale on Minsk market to protest against the deceptive character of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against Alexander Lukachenko's power: 'The dictator should return'.
Some admit that they haven't even chosen: ‘What will it be useful if they do what they want with my voice’, says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime which has shown itself to foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-participation of Visa for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the disposal of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
'We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the census', Juri Potemkin, spokesperson of the Union of democratic forces, complained of a heterogeneous combination of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, notes Alexander Milinkiewitsch, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and a leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who is counting the votes, and with us this is the executive.
If the members of the opposition enter Parliament, then because they were appointed, and not elected.
But their accession to Parliament can mean broadcasting time, meeting in the regions and legislative proposals.
The opposition is thus guilty of interfering with the political game, because dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which Russia is heavily indebted to, is facing a crisis and we are not reforming ourselves, we are in danger of becoming a Russian protectorate.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election process, does not recognise the election as valid.
It stresses that the voter participation rates appear too high and that the extension of voting fees in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for any type of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that a choice has taken place?, the leader of Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the lobby.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are primarily in line with the government's ideas.
The silence of the night decreases again over October.
On TV, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Undermining - From blood that has become safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its establishment, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to be happy because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, which has been severely shaken by the scandal of blood tried in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood vessels administered by the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated during the 1980s with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and the dissatisfaction of the public, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation conducted by Judge Horace Krever in February 1994 aimed to bring light to the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to draw up directives to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While Richter Krever was still reluctant to report, several provinces at that time set up a committee on the legs, whose aim was to develop a new system for administering blood cans in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
According to the reports of Gélineau and cancer, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company, to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when hema-Quebec took up his work, almost 38% of the people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and through the work in this area over the following years, we have regained public confidence," she says, before she proudly stresses that at the beginning of 2008 almost 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, maintains in consciousness that `trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting in accordance with the principle of caution.
At that time, we experienced the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of bovine disease in Europe with, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been in charge since the founding of 1998.
And we didn't have the slightest idea if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
So we rely on one of the main guidelines of the reports of cancer and gélineau, which, according to one to apply exclusion measures, if one does not know this and if a disease progresses only slowly, as is obviously the case with the Creutzfeldt Jacob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
Thus, in April 1999, no blood was taken from persons who had remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, there was no doubt that this disease was transmitted through the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied has absolutely a meaning.
In 1999, there was a much more accurate technology on the market to detect HIV: the nuclear acid tests (NST) that allow the donor to directly detect the occurrence of the virus itself in the blood of the donor, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the previously used tests.
The NSTs allowed to shorten the incubation time that occurs between the time the person was infected and that, if the first viruses can be proven by our techniques in blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced for a period of less than one week.
So the risk that certain donors might be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements allowed the risk of transmission of AIDS via a blood transfusion to a considerable extent.
Today, one out of 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
In other words, it means that 12 million blood cans should be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood cans every year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurs where HIV was transmitted via a blood cans.
I think you can feel it today if you get a blood transfusion or write it down to restore health," says Hema-Quebec director.
Our challenge for the next ten years is to keep our products safe.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
Just last year, on the island of Réunion, the Chikungunya virus, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted by insects over the blood.
We need to keep an eye on ', Dr. Décary continues before she stresses that hema-Quebec must also provide adequate supplies in addition to a safe supply.
'The need is rising, because the population is ageing.
As treatment for cancer is more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood supply network, of which on average only 3% of the inhabitants of Quebec suitable for blood donation.
Every healthy person, who is 18 years old or older and meets the eligibility criteria, can donate blood every 56 days, so six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people who provide their blood are not accepted because they are ill with AIDS or malaria, for example, and who is travelling to a country where malaria is spread is excluded from the blood donation for a year.
`With this 3% we create to receive an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Missing stocks are very rare.
But the members of this donor network must be renewed when they are older and no longer able to afford blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep it and bring it to become regular donors.
Life today is so hectic that you rarely find the time to spend an hour in the blood donation,' says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec not only supplies blood preservatives, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eye drops and skin, which are used almost exclusively for serious fire injuries.
These tissues are investigated, processed and frozen before they are intermarried with Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public nabelsnurblutbank Quebecs.
In the navel cord that was previously considered biomedical waste, there is plenty of blood on stem cells that can be used to treat severe diseases, such as leukaemia.
A few weeks ago, we celebrated the storage of our thousandth nailed blood sample, and we plan to take more than a thousand each year.
`We should begin next year to make it available for transplants,’ explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of nabelsnurblut-absorbing as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-final
Montreals Impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all the towers) against the satellites from Seattle during the second and decisive game of the quarter final series at the Saputo Stadium, where the total ratio is counted, qualified for the semi-final round of the separation games of the first league of the USL.
The middle-field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive door in the ninth minute of the game.
After a first half-time without a door for both the one and the other, the middle-field players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the Montreals formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the sonders.
We remember that during the first game of the front and back series on Friday Impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila had introduced a 2 to 1-down position in a headquarters Seattle.
In the semifinal, impact will be measured with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit in the back game in Minnesota through a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps entered the semi-final round with a total ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short - victory by Kovalev
The number 1-Trio of the Canadian team is ready to attack the season.
Yesterday evening, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostsyn will launch the attack on the Panther from Florida with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a door, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass into this game, the fourth of the tricolore into six preparatory games.
Kovalev won the victory by shooting the only door of the entire shooting.
I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel good.'
`He's fixed too much on it in the first half, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he's lost the end of the game.
He's been hit by a storm.
Charest on the North
The Prime Minister shall not refuse to hold elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general meeting of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest moved yesterday to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (Linke) is trying to be elected in today's partial election.
`Move the course of our last large border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levi, following all the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydropower plants, mining plants, viewed by Quebec in `Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large funds as during the election period.
Against the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude him from holding the elections this autumn, even if he claimed that his timetable was very full.
The 'Nord Plan' is the fourth element of a 'vision' which the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely a 'new economic space' which provides for an agreement with France on labour forces, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has often been mentioned in the Prime Minister's speech in recent years, the opening of the north - the northern area at the 49th latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was 'a jewel with enormous potential' but did not call a date, no investment sum or precise priorities for the coming projects.
At the top of some views on what could be done more: mainly on water energy, in the forest, but especially in the mining sector, benefits from the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr. Charests, the North has 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This 'area twice as big as France' 'is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only near us, it is in us', he stressed how to show clearly that he is looking for a national founder dream to realize.
Quebec grew very much by its connection to the north, he stressed: the road to the gold in Abitib, the technique Quebec, the James-Bucht.
'It belongs to us, it is our future', he added, after he had put a theatrical pause to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always called for, the prime minister of the press explained.
This is a traditional attitude that all governments have followed.
There is a border line in which there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity is offered, I will accept this attitude on behalf of the government again', he said.
Moreover, 'with the climate change, we need to rethink our vision from the north', he explained and spoke about the Northwest Passage, which will be manageable due to the ice melt all year round.
In view of this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is precisely an obligation to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the region, the inhabitants of the city, and the inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very friendly with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létoureau (former Pakistani MPs from Hungary) have already started consultations with some thirty communities.
A committee of ministers led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and land estimates) took up an important position, took up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity where 'man will create a common vision'.
The development of the North will, moreover, be replaced in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
the North plan will be 'convened, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as if it were a continuation of that of the liberal prime minister who was before him in the office.
Like the Liberals who were before us in the office, we have thought about turning the challenges into new growth and development change.
This was in addition to one of the ever-refused topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a big cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the taking over of the party by Jean Readage.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename Beauharnois's power plant into Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
`From Godbout, who created the Hydro-Quebec, about reading that achieved the quiet revolution and the state of water electricity, to Burrassa, who made the James book, our party always knew to determine the future’, explained Jean Charest.
The press took reference to another conservative project, this time on the program `Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project Water Force Staff Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
'That remains among us, but I have to be there,' he confided to his party members, which occurred in those crashing storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and of course also in 2009, has in fact not yet been excluded from this autumn's election, which is possible by law.
He stressed, however, that his timetable is complete, especially because of a mission by the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The general meeting of the weekend provided the Liberal Party with a platform of nationalist plans, especially those relating to `the Constitution', which were adopted without further adoption: the PLQ specifically calls for recognition of 'the particularity of Quebec' in the Constitution.
She also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Remote Reporting Council and to have a veto regarding the decisions that were taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the guidelines of the Northern Plan were included with Skeps.
The leader of the Québec Party, Pauline Marois, reiterated the policy for the development of the Nord-du-Quebec, which the Government introduced in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If she had done so, «we are going a lot further today», Ms. Marois, on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today), judged Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has agreed to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
`But what we want is that this is not just going to be a big idea,’ said the leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who comes back from the holiday today.
Letters - A country of refuge
Mr. Vic Toews, former Justice Minister (what irony) at Harper's office, it was the last summer he allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'sand' for Canada.
This woman, who has led an unending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says just as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We have to do this with a government that, as the only one of all the countries concerned, has not taken their countryman captive in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even consider Omar Khadr as a young man when things happened that were going on for him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and leaves a child soldier under inhuman conditions.
The only one who goes down to a judicial parody to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that, above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers advocate bringing Omar Khadr home to get him a fair trial in Canada.
This government also closes its eyes to torture: It is of little interest that a young adult after so many years of age will certainly be broken for ever.
We are not aware of it yet, but we are just experiencing here a wilful violation of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word, which harper constantly carries on like a flag, and which does not sound so saturating out of his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morals: a Canadian citizen can be deliberately abused, tortured and imprisoned, even after the well-being of a government leader, who is only supported by the minority (may be one of the minority after October 14th...).
Many voters believe to find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order. But they do not see that this government has given up on what has been called the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this dissatisfaction, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The Orwellic Talk of Barrick Gold
In her issue of September 17, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of Canadian Goldmine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and pursues an orwelling logic, that the world's largest gold-making company sought to open up a public transparent debate of over six million against three authors and a small, medium-sized publishing house.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of slanderous complaints, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely suspended by Mr Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way is to conduct a public debate, to drive everyone into the ruins, which is to represent one of their opposing views.
Just as the process requires, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare for their defense and fight with very uneven weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the almost incalculable pockets of goldmine.
The tactics of these unequal struggles are also often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consistent regime that causes the opposite side to die and also frightens anyone who dares to re-examine the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things before the public opinion.
In contrast to what is going on and on in many of the countries where Barrick Gold is working, there are usually debates in Canada due to the exchange of ideas and not the linkage.
So it would have been enough if the goldmine had revealed its books and documents and opened up a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent testing teams that could have brought light to this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in the public opinion and erases the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he could at the same time ask for a 'public' debate and, at the same time, reject the views of this public.
It seems that this word in the Vice-President's world includes only those lawyers who have paid generously, and not the community of all Canadians; a very well-contained view of the concept.
In a democracy, even devious people have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this primarily because it rejects the brutal attitude of goldmines.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many people believe is a key issue (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just addressed a request to the authors of Noir Canada, in which they demand that they no longer use this term...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and the truth that is fundamental to every democratic society.
It is entirely right to quote credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world, then who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has long known to get debate and disagreements in the grip and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate complaint clearly shows that, contrary to what she is proposing, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take measures that restrict this type of unfair complaint.
Rescue for the Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand themselves
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached agreement yesterday on the most extensive economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan of over 700 billion US dollars, which is to stop the financial crisis, which has been killing Wall Street for months, still needs to be adopted by the two Chambers of Congress.
The main content is: Better control of the Members on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public funds used, new arrangements to mitigate the number of houses due to payment delays, as well as the right to monitor the fees paid to the managers of the supported companies.
The US Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be marketable," explained the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
'It was all done to protect the real economy and the American people from the crisis at Wall Street,' the Democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: If we don't do this, the trauma, the chaos and the unrest will be huge in the daily lives of Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, in fear of the effect that would have had a new loss on the spirit of the investors.
The deadline agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two candidates for the US Presidency, who were only recently involved in the negotiations, showed themselves rather as supporters of the agreement, but without neglecting to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barack Obama was on the addendum of certain provisions to agree, especially those which would allow the owners to keep their houses, and those which concern the salaries of the heads of employees of the state-owned company.
‘If the taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures due to the inability of certain persons, that is nothing to which one might wish to be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary', he explained on American television stations.
When he was asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: `I would like to know the details only, but I hope so.
The guidelines that I have read show that this is a thing that we all have to digest and with which we can proceed.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable', he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at the taxpayer's money
He comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the location of a real estate bubble, which led to the first collapse of the risk-rich mortgage loans (subprime) before it extended to other forms of expanded bonds (PCAA) and finally to freeze the financial power and in the ruins of banks and money institutions.
A group of Republican MPs failed last week's first attempt to reach agreement.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of companies in need are only to be secured by the government and not to be bought, one believes that the gas is out of the way.
In order to round out the perspective for everyone at the Congress, a provision has also been added that, if the government should lose this programme within five years, it could raise new taxes in order to retain the capital used by it.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the President sees it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be adopted in a renewed vote by the Congress.
In contrast to his help, Washington receives shares from the supported companies that bring him in the case of dividends and that can sell it again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to suspend the detention procedures for the apartments covered by this plan and also to set deadlines for the repayment and accommodation paid to the managers of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber to vote on it today, and then the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all her efforts, she is still not sure that her plan will get green light.
In fact, more votes were taken against yesterday, both on the part of the Republicans and the Democrats.
'Unfortunately Washington does not understand us,' declared Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Board's Financial Commission.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are in it to ask the taxpayers to cash.'
The democratic MEP Brad Sherman, leader of a group in the Congress called the 'Caucus of the Skeptics', represents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written us to inform us: we ask the Congress not to be put under pressure and carefully to determine which way to go', he explained yesterday.
At the same time, we have again received evidence in Europe that it is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial publication of the Fortis Banking Group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The accession of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French Bank of BNP Paribas announced that it would refuse to buy its competitors, which is in great difficulty, since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis through the risk-rich real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty-largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, explained yesterday by Dutch Finance Minister Wauter Bos.
To compensate, we receive a right of choice and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households value, now that uncertain times are announced. '
During this time, the British government was on the other side of the arm's length channel just to put another bank under pressure from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would purchase the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to be made public by the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of an engaged icon
His beauty with the blue eyes was his trumpet for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor get rid of the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensation, his sensitivity, and an obvious talent have held him back from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters to the world.
But what a great long-term runner!
On Friday at the age of 83, Paul Newman, who died of lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, for whom he resembled and for whom he had long been a kind of rival on the canvas, more careful in his performance, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as a son of a German Jew and a Hungarian-speaking mother.
Its European roots should be one of the peaceful faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality features.
Because in him, a whole country that was in love with the self-made man was again reflected in the fighter who was injured in the Pacific War in the fight, who studied art in Yale at the beginning of the 50s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York, before he had success in the theater, in television and soon in the cinema.
Even this man, who fought for the rights of citizens, was also the driver who became Mans II in 1979 at the 24-hour race, and also a sex symbol, although he had lived in a pretense relationship with the actor Joanne Woodward since 1958.
He also disappears from the unknown aspects of this mysterious, retaining, committed and oversensitive star with respect to the glamour of the show business, whose puzzles will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans moved the cinematographers this weekend to Tamil, while the dark screen of memories played all his great roles.
More than half a century of American film art is constantly changing with it.
The charming Cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) represses into memory, and the young man who returned his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) to The Cat on the hot Blechdach filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter memory (1990) will be called to mind, which will disturb his sensitive Mr Bridge, who will be disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all of his promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A hand full of shit) by Robert Wise, a role that James Dean thought was taken back after his death and made the Newman correctly known in 1956.
This beautiful Ganove in the outstanding The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a little bit.
This face through the times, it was him.
He's still there.
In his course of life epochs unite.
The youth knows him from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in The Hudsucker Proxy of Brother Coen in 1994.
With a last role in 2003 as the path of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several filmmakers who have retired early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the satellite for a long time, and thus betray Hollywood, its assets, its punk and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humour, as a living challenge to the 'underplaying' when he assessed his very expressive performance.
The metaer was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, who had been flying the roles for a long time.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotics, alcoholics, fieslings or doubts, with their perfect representation he reflected his disparity and appearance.
As director, Newman revealed unknown pages of his true fine sensitivity.
His 1968 Rachel (after the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife, Joanne Woodward, in the lead, drew a fine portrait of women full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, dedicated this 1984 to his film Harry and Son, a work full of feelings and sadness.
In the flood of honors yesterday about Newman ergoss, his close friend and former gun-fighting friend Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid): `His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Generosity and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, he is now also a great advocate of citizens' rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of the Hollywood drift, there.
We may have seen him with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, bakery or other foods, and this made it quite tasteless, even though at first we found it funny.
However, the profits from its sales flow into its foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myths, Newman engaged to the shooting.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: "Always and to the end your father was incredibly grateful for his good stars.
It was an honor to be here.'
And for us, it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
A voracious citizen, in the narrowest and widest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of supplement & amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the negotiations in the criminal process began against János' award and his complicity.
In particular, the accused is accused of engaging in organised crime, as well as grossly dangerous damage and fraud, and other criminal acts, including document fraud.
According to the Public Prosecutor, the funds obtained from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often charged with false invoices.
Government funds and grants from self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to be part of the funds of the organization Fiatal Balldal, part of the private funds of each other.
As announced by the investigating authorities, fictitious calculations have been submitted in relation to the tendering money, and the associations are not required to comply with their obligations.
According to the prosecution, most of the bills were to be faked.
The billing blocks were purchased on the market of Józsefváros, the round seal was placed in Kisunalas.
The decision on which companies the invoices are to be issued was decided on that round trip north of the Plattensee, on which István Lados of János was awarded.
In the course of this "Experience Tour", Lados should find out about pensions and restaurants.
He requested invoices on consumption to be able to submit later calculations based on these models for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest.
These calculations are intended to have been manipulated mostly by István Lados and his complex, András ‹ri, which should later have been responsible for the drafting of the corresponding reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "Expert Tour" was a beer room.
As two of the additions and Co's invoices issued in 2003, the gastronomy company is expected to have won the nine-year group of Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the head of the company says that such a large group would not have been able to fit into the premises at once.
Another bill, published in the summer of 2002 at the Jobb Jöv ürt Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évesredért, also showed serious form and content errors.
In a guesthouse in Badacsnotomaj, which has only three rooms and cannot accommodate more than 10 people at the same time, 130 guests are expected to stay.
The fantasy of the accountants was apparently not as limited as it was about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company in whose bookkeeping documents of customers Job Jöv ért and Hoppá according to the prosecution authority did not appear at all.
As Managing Director Gy†zˈ Farkas of hvg.hu told him, he immediately realized that it was false documents when he was presented to him by the Public Prosecutor during a survey.
"Our company name and tax number were wrong on the stamp."
And further: Apart from the errors of form, the fact that the company should have accommodated hundreds of people after having a total of eleven rooms that are impossible to accommodate so many people was also wrong.
The restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The taxable persons have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel office, taken from them in the visa, offers exclusively travel abroad, and thus they have indicated Hungarian travels on the cash account, which also contradicts the company’s accounting practice.
As was known during the investigations, they have also pointed to VAT on the invoices, although travel agencies dealing with a country outside the EU are free of VAT.
The amount of VAT was totaled at four of the Révfülöp Kft. invoices issued to the Job Jöv×ért Foundation were wrong, as the operation was charged for 25 only 15 percent VAT, and only machine invoices were issued by the employees, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another error that had occurred to the "accountants" was that they had indicated in one case "warningstransport" as provided performance, although this was not offered by the company specialising in investment advice, the public prosecutor informed them.
Other forms errors - false accounting format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the calculations displayed on Együtt a Harmadik Évesredért Alapítvány, as well as on the twenty-first. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be disproved as false.
Also in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managers assessed never to have issued the bills.
Another "error" is the fakes at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This society was at the time (2001) just in a resolution when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület were supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore stated that the accounts had not been issued by itself.
Consciously False
The other group of accountants are persons who were fully aware that they had to lay fictitious accounts.
At the request of the Fiatal Balldal - Ifjú Socialisták, the Foundation of Esély Budapest Alapitvány has issued invoices for the Foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évesredért, with an amount of about HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the manager of the Collab Kft. was transferred from one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to exhibit the fictional calculations.
The Biogate Kft, which is currently in liquidation, is also intended to have worked together with a supplement and co.: In 2003, the GmbH will have provided the Job Jövʹért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the Athlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenny® Egyesület with false calculations in the total value of HUF 5 million, which relate to unspent services.
However, there was also little payment traffic, as the accounts were destroyed immediately after their exhibition, but what the interested parties had forgotten in their documents.
The third group of accountants shall include persons directly involved with the accused.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian Managing Director of Delta Trió Kft., a company based in Budapest, but not located there.
This company is expected to present several invoices for the sale of EDV components in the total value of HUF of around 18 million between October and December 2005.
According to the investigation authority, the cash investment Kft., which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is expected to have been the buyer of Kisunhalas.
The company's manager was a Romanian who should also be provided with company documents by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov stood during the investigations to have invoices on behalf of the GmbH. at the Atlasz and Hoppá Associations, as well as at Együtt a Harmadik Évesredért Alapitvány and to have cashed their own counter value.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos-Investment Bt. are to be founded by Romanian wallers on Iván Kubatov's express desire.
In fact, however, none of these companies were active, which, according to the defendant, was in the absence of orders.
However, he was able to benefit from the companies: At the request of his complicity, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was commissioned to prepare the company's submissions, he presented invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations linked to the grant, such as atlasz and Y-Generací.
In total, Kubatov will have exposed 15 bills worth HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The public prosecutor assumes that Kubatov could have cancelled 10% of the amount of the invoice as well as VAT.
Kubatov should even have abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictional calculations - in this case the calculations were attached to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért presented their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Tancsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but these amounts were used abroad.
To avoid this, they presented to the TMA five fictitious calculations of the Works Team Kft.
These calculations were also provided in the Ministry of Education when Arpád Kemecsei was surveyed.
In the course of the negotiations, some defendants are now charged with an opinion on the conduct of the accounting error, as they have already been brought before the State Prosecutor.
A feeling could be if the main defendant, János, decided to make a comprehensive appeal.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had already promised to report more comprehensively about everything, his statement still stands out.
The question remains whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him with regard to the restoration of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether a contribution is prepared to take responsibility.
But it is quite possible that the supplement now plays the "unfortunate" after his attempts to soften the arrest and house arrest were thrown into dull ears.
While other criminals who have suffered far greater damage and have not paid them, on a free foot, or at least under house arrest, this possibility remains rejected.
The psychology of the area - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overestimate the error bid.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people in a competition, such as a rise in eBay, do not get beat and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto, while the others participated in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the sample were investigated through functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to earn money, however, an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain, was measured at the loss of the auction, where the opponent's area played a major role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore considered that the price increase was explained by avoiding an overreaction of the contraction.
In order to undermine their thesis, the economists in the research group have also undertaken additional investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups against a partner should be provided under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product and then made their interventions.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward, in case they come out of the game as winners.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the case of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was that the emphasis was on one on the gain, while the other on the loss.
However, as evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the group against "losing" were willing to make higher approaches than those in the control or profit group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These are the behaviours observed in auctions so far only based on the joy of winning, or risk prevention.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so that we have now prepared a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you visit your doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
However, the number of infected is estimated to be hundreds of thousands, but only seven thousand are treated, which means that patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for hepatitis caused by various viruses, infectious liver diseases.
Symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the errors and diseases differ.
Hepatitis viruses are reportedly spread to two different types: in hepatitis A and E by the digestive tract (e.g. by contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, secretion, or storage).
Travellers are recommended for vaccination against viruses A and B, and there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A are approximately two to three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal pain and vomiting.
Then the yellowing occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine is dark, and the healing can last up to two or three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die from hepatitis B-induced diseases such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis each year.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only every 10 infected are treated with medicinal products.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected don't even know about their disease, since the bug destroys the liver cells in a home-made way - in many cases the first symptoms are shown after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular control tests, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more frequent: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory study, it is advisable to seek the doctor for the first signs of unknown origin.
At the right time, the disease is healthy, the virus can be eradicated, thus preventing the risk of infection and preventing cancer.
The World Day of Hepatitis, 2004 is the first time that patients are represented worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of these chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their emergence and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As recent research has shown, religious belief as a kind of "serious" has been shown to have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: it was investigated how much the belief in God affects the pain of the human being, the British leaf reported "Telegraph".
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, every 12 believers and atheists received electroshocks, while they studied a painting of the mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to disable most of the pain.
By means of a brain scan technology, the Catholics were able to activate part of their brain, which is responsible for pain control.
The study was the first in a research project in which philosophers and theologians from different departments of the university also participated.
When the test was performed, the samples were connected to the left hand, which gave the electroshocks.
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: To one image of the mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and to the other Leonardo da Vinci "Dame with Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would trigger a sort of religious trance among the believers, while they chose a picture of Vince, because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt as soothing.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and at this time they received 20 electroshocks in four stages, while they were supposed to view either the religious, or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they had felt at the sight of God's mother "in safety" as if they were "uncareable" and had felt "peace and peace".
While considering the religious painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the attempt, thought that similar effects could also be produced with other, highly effective images even in the atheists, one had to find only the corresponding photo.
"We should find a picture that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and it does so in many cases," says Wright.
After these excellent results, only the question remains what effect a Madonna image of Leonardos or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the believers.
Would the high-quality young woman Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you're telling me about yourself.
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can claim that she is in people's pockets as well as about her heads in the sky: she knows where people spent their holiday, which doctors they go to, and what they are moving.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's CEOs.
In the direction of Skeptics, which are predicted by Orwell's Horror Visions, he can point out: They would just ignore the essentials of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently thought that Google’s main goal was to collect even more personal data about users and thus to get closer to the company’s original goal, which they want to “order all the information in this world”.
Schmidt explained that after ten years of global change in work, Google was still only at the beginning of the information collection.
Asking for status Quo in five years meant Schmidt: he wanted Google to be able to ask questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What kind of job really suits me?", however, software programs were not yet able to do so, as they didn't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches, search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the visited pages.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to store his or her own search history and then retrieve it later so that the results can be generated much more precisely later, and on the same logic the so-called "recommendations" are also based on which the system recommends tailored products and services due to the previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the case of a data abuse - "If you look at what I'm doing" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential force represented by the company, which has an enormous effect on fear, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the pursuit of power, which in many internet users is at odds with rejection.
However, it is evident that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event, and in these legal cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A parade example for this was the recent action against paedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which the Brazilian government provided information collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also made it possible to identify the paedophilia.
However, in May, users who were concerned with personal rights were able to breathe when Google successfully brought EFF against the FBI together with the civil law organization: therefore, Google can also be forced to issue information to the FBI on a secret request with no point of the Constitution in the future.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the issue of 50,000 Web addresses and 1,000 search terms, with reference to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but it has been able to keep the list of individual users, or their web and search terms back in two months.)
Google's image thus remains controversial: those who release their personal data to the public because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy by using Google's services, the company is making a contribution to the companies that are producing conservatively.
Indes sees the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and delights in computer fans, activists and users, the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leaders, even though both fight for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google does not require identification codes for its users, unlike Microsoft, and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, continuously updated source code and program package seems to be much more attractive, younger and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, geeks are seeing the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet, a relationship that has been focused particularly in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is nothing but collaboration, speaking, leaving users deliberately tracking and using the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are different individually, the main thing remains the same, that is to say, public.
At the same time, an average youth can manage his profile on several community portals - from Facebook to Xanga, they can connect them through other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can finally integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that are hosted by Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples prove: When you look at the party photos last night, the friend will soon find out with whom she has enjoyed her unfaithful friend, or the employee will be released, because in his blog he is only making his trouble over the management of the company - one is sure: the term "privateness" has now been fully reinterpreted.
Whoever leads an online life is what he prizes from himself - in this way, for example, you could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even run the Google Monopol, can do it well - like with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google's search engine, but deliberately does not leave any traces.
Not few people deliberately register not on community pages so that they are not found, but also the online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphics tools and RSS feeds, can deal with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and therefore not generate the best profile from the user.
The public opinion is bound to wait until Google shows its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even in front of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising areas of AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, and the increasingly fast-impeded services provide not only Microsoft, but also other software developers.
However, critical observers also find the disturbing opposites: For example, the Group Management rejected a protest by the employees after the fee of the company's kindergarten was doubled, and the management considered that the multiple maintenance of the employees was too expensive. However, it is quite mild that in 2006 Google even went to the knees before the Chinese government and agreed with an agreement, which would filter out all the critical hits of the regime, or those who violated the good taste.
The Group's internal rules say that no new service will be sought in advance, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could be re-enforced again: While some believe that Google's book and magazine scan or archiving project is currently taking into account the extent that the company should soon be confronted with the Supreme Court, others are more concerned about the "Health" system, which enables the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already delivers the material - for example "Scroogled", the famous Roman of Cory Doctorow describes in a better orwelling manner a future in which a human being is appreciable thanks to Google-related data.
Two young people help the double killer of Ózd in the elimination of the trace
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interviewed two young people who are suspected of having been involved in the destruction of the traces, the spokesperson of the Police Commissioner Borsod announced on Tuesday.
The young people were steadfast, they are currently being accused of aid.
According to the news agency MTI, it is two girls who defend themselves on a free foot.
Aid is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was investigated on Sunday.
The man is under the urgent suspicion of having killed several people on purpose from money.
In the course of the investigations, it has been shown that the 23-year-old owed a 53-year-old a larger amount of money.
However, the suspect did not want to pay off his debts, so he dragged his believer on a site in Ozd last Wednesday, where he and his nine - year - old daughter killed him.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act long - this also proves the fact that he has committed the murder with a weapon hidden in the tattoo.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapons and the circumstances of their use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange offers for Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered for the 100% purchase of the Prague Stock Packages.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer that Poland had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
Following notifications from the Czech daily newspaper "E15", the Polish offers include the highest purchase price offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far made offers.
Petr Koblic, Chief of the Prague Stock Exchange last week said that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owners, and he also did not conclude that it could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange to 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 per cent stake, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In its comments devoted to the ongoing international financial crisis, some leading European leaves already spoke on Tuesday from the "second 11 September".
We have to thank the US President for the global financial disaster, for example, "La Repubblica" - the President has not even been able to get his own party behind the draft legislation, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as billions of heavy investors Warren Buffett called it, it would be appropriate to speak of a "second September 11th".
Parts of the press in Madrid also placed the sin bucket in Washington.
According to the El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now at the edge of the collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and it will suffering the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote at the Congress, the danger that Washington has no political means to deal with the crisis is threatened.
The world economy depends in the air, just at a time when one of the biggest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, for example, is referred to as the Geneva "Day Advisor".
Although some countries could still provide their money institutions with savings packages and save banks with the money of taxpayers from the bank's debt.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and no more banks are involved, then neither further financial prices nor other immediate measures will be helpful.
In the long term, EU Member States had to jump over their shadows and centralise control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid to weakening money institutions, the Viennan "The Standard" recalls. Furthermore, the newspaper continues to be increasingly realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers now had to get a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not taken the crisis seriously, which is now moving like a tsunami over the old continents.
Although the "jurors" did not have to "wed" immediately with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable, however, to consider in which case it would be reasonable to take the money from the taxpayers to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car simulates the flight of the sky
What would be the best way to develop new accident prevention technologies if we didn't imitate nature's barrier sensors?
For example, the bees.
At the CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented, in which the Nissan engineers of Hummeln were inspired by the creation of new preventative systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic system controlled by Autoboters of the type BR23C, a mini-auto, equipped with the properties of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In the flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protection shield", Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology-PR and research development, said at the exhibition.
The combined eye of the bees, which can see in any direction and in an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role.
In order to reflect the function of the composite eye, the researchers come up with the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles to the BR23C in an area of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates its distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision prevention process.
The obstacle is recorded in second fractures, and the autobot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the legs, by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this manoeuvre is purely instinctive.
"If it weren't, the autobot couldn't react fast enough to remove the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the Autobot project.
The system needs to react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most internal and invincible part of the shield - a layer, which is still inevitable within the accident.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of bees if they deviate from other bees.
And that must take place in a fraction of a second.
However, the deviation, unlike the bees, can not go up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the turnability of the tires.
While the bees here are finally open many possibilities to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to use only the rotational movement, or acceleration and braking.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are easier and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it is coming to the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less to the processing of the data, and even less to the ability to store it.
This device must process only some inputs per second and respond accordingly.
It doesn't have to save it, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction on the basis of previous maneuvers, so it takes on only one handful KB memory.
There's no need for gigabyte and megabyte-hard memories.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision prevention technology, which will be serialised in production after the assessment of Nissan within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology at GPS satellite navigation by making the driver aware of obstacles and thus leading him to the goal.
A name for the sinner child
Now there is the written version of the 700 billion-dollar heavy rescue package law that will be applied in several stages and aims to buy the bad credit of banks.
In the first pass, half of the money is to be spent.
At a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight on the eastern coast, the congressional delegates, following a multi-day debate, went through an agreement on the 700-billion-dollar major rescue package, reported Reuters.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, a democratic president in the U.S. House of Representatives, and thought that the agreement should be brought to paper only.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson referred to the result: the program will be effective and it will be effective, but more is needed. According to Pelosi, it was not about saving the Wall Street, but about the noise of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, so Washington's time Sunday, 8 a.m. (Middle European time Monday, 2 a.m.), but did not trigger a flight to the stock exchange.
On Monday, the House of Representatives agreed first on the draft legislation on the stabilization of the economy in 2008, and then the Senate is on the line.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and also the White House welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, spokesperson of the White House.
The program, however, deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush Administration, which should issue the 700 billion dollars once for the purchase of falser, with loans of charged securities.
In a first instalment, a maximum of half of the 700 billion amount is to be spent, with 250 billion immediately available after the Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday. This sum is to be spent for the purchase of credit-payers, poor securities, and over the next $100 billion is to be decided by the President.
The programme will be reviewed by a Commission itself, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combined tactic: it can at the same time buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-loaded securities, or other "toxic" credits.
As reported by the Ministry, the purchase can be carried out both in an auction and directly.
The law enables the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the funds concerned and the companies pay the fees due to the damage to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to 700 billion dollars can be provided as immediate aid to the American financial system, whether for the large purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, as Paulson says.
However, the heads of the banks in difficulty and now targeted at state aid can expect to be cut short by the government by their manufacturings called the "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang.
A reduction in fees will only be made in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The reduction essentially means that if the department purchases an auction, the "Golden Handshake" will be taxed unless the retired bank manager is retired.
In the case of a direct purchase of the default credit, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the managers are not transferred.
The picture also includes that the existing Gold Handshake contracts are not amended - the restrictions relate only to new agreements, so that more people can participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that reductions in managerial fees are regulated by law, the Democratic Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, commented on the measure.
The State gains participation rights in participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers is reduced, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the savings bank get better.
The draft law provides that the President must submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years on how taxpayers should recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were two sides of skeptics who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect the taxpayer's money at all, so the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: The measures were preceded by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

No more visas in the United States since 2009?
Kingga Göncz sees good chances of the coming into force of the US-Hungarian visa agreement on 12 January, as the Foreign Minister explained before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In your view, "all is now dependent only on whether the electronic immigration control system is introduced in time in the overseas. "
However, it also stressed that there will be no entry permission in the new system, but tourists had to register in advance.
The Head of the Hungarian Diplomacy has been conducting negotiations in Washington since today.
She meets with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will transmit the "Middle Cross with Stars" of the Republic of Hungary, and she will also conduct talks with the foreign political advisers of the Democratic Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue packages for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support on Sunday for the 700 billion-dollar heavy bailout for banks. However, there are also politicians who call for the Minister of Finance's resignation.
The congress and government representatives announced on Sunday that they had come to an agreement on the bank's rescue package after lengthy Marathon consultations.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the rise of the frozen credit market, have become the main issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claimed to be better than the respective opponent in order to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
After recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand its momentum thanks to the economic themes, while McCains Hoch, who protected him from the presentation of vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was also silenced.
At an election in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress would quickly adopt the law on the 700 billion-dollar heavy package.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passports of consumer protection that he has supported with.
"We need to act now, and while responsible (...) - your jobs, your savings, all industrial branches, and the stability of the whole economy are threatened" - he said before 35,000 spectators.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic vision "absolute".
In an interview given to the sender ABC, McCain said: "Daran we will all have a hard time... but there is certainly no alternative."
The Republican Senator said that the plan also presupposes the establishment of a control commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the limitation of the completions for the top manager - something he has been on.
The CBS said Obama, McCain would not have played a final role in the negotiations, but Obama, who was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives would probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press release of the German-speaking area
The right warehouse is intact, only the voters became aware within the camp - thus "The Mirror" comments the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spell.de)
In the online issue of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayerns Revolution Versatiles Her Fathers".
According to the renowned politician, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein Huber-Duo took over his office.
The Christian Christians have renewed Bayern for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
At the same time, the epoch break is a problem of Christ democracy, as is Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the CSU disaster did not come, but on Sunday something came to an end, which was already quite exactly ten years ago: the unmistakable hegemony of a state party
Because 10 years ago, 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent and thus fell for the first time since the 1950s under the 50 percent mark.
This was repeated three years ago at the 2005 federal elections, which is still in the much quoted Stoiber era.
The modernization carried out by the CSU in the Federal Republic of Germany has ultimately poisoned its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted this 40 years ago, but at the time it was estimated to be significant. However, without any impact, the secularization, the educational success, the closure of East and North Germans in the prosperous Bavarian regions could not remain faithful to the CSU voters.
Modernization is always a matter of increasing options, and that has political implications.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and self-willed.
It is noteworthy that in the last few weeks, the classic citizen groups have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with abitur as a university degree.
Here, CSU's support fell to less than 40 percent.
The Press (depresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily newspaper reports in its "Who with whom? Participating in Coalition issues" articles on the chaotic internal political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the EESC.
The OEPS prohibits the involvement of the SPÖ in internal matters.
The BZÖ shows itself open in all directions for discussions, while the Greens do not yet want to determine a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is moving around the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the parties barely looked into their maps.
SPÖ-Chief Werner Faymann confirmed his wish to negotiate with the EVP.
The SPÖ wishes to show that cooperation between the two parties is very much possible - in some countries and in the social partnership - this is already the case.
The question of whether he could present himself to a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current CEO of the OVP as vice-cancer, was left open by Faymann.
As he said, the voters would have chosen the Schüssel-Motterer course.
A repetition of this direction is not in question.
Manyer has responded cautiously to red offers.
Cooperation could not be fruitful, he felt that if Faymann tried to get involved in the internal affairs of the EDP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or in coalition, is currently fully open, and these issues should be discussed internally.
BZÖ-Chief Jörg Haider showed up in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are prepared to take on government responsibility," said Haider.
Járóka: The devil's circle of poverty and the sect must be broken
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, which is now headed by the EU Presidency of France.
In her speech addressed to the plenary, Mr Járóka, Members of the European People's Party, in particular to the Education Section, made attention to the fact that this is one of the most serious violations of the law, which the Roma children reject, and this is the greatest obstacle to their need for validity.
The high-level conference was opened by French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The participants included representatives of governments, European social partners, as well as the most important European law enforcement and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As reported by the Press Office of the MEPs of Fidesz, Járóka noted that, in addition to discrimination in the search for jobs, Roma would be forced primarily because of their low level of education from the labour market.
"The vast majority of Roma youth have no secondary education, and because of poor primary education, only a small part of them can reach a university degree."
Járóka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right, which has a key role to play in the application of other human rights.
Investments in early training of Roma children could boost the economy of the EU Member States.
In the view of the honourable Members, it is important that this relationship be made aware of the widest possible circle of Roma and non-Roma.
Because earlier, a Roma student starts school to increase its chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; and through income and income tax, they contribute to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high quality education - the poor and segregated education must be set aside" - says Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Members have said, a common, objective and action-oriented action by the European Union is necessary to accelerate the deregulation process in the education sector, and it is essential that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be properly adhered to.
"We must break through the devil's circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as a full-fledged citizen," Járóka asked.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit will be organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advancement of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also national, levels within the meaning of the European Year of Equal opportunities.
CSU: Pleasure on time
At the end of October the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election break, there are still no heads, at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the personal debates were held.
Participating Erwin Huber and Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace is worth.
On the fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17-percent loss of voice will be decided at the extraordinary party on the last October weekend.
However, the much trained duo already made it clear that it did not want to stick on its chairs.
They want to address the angry group and the party base, which one day after the "Bayerian tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority of personal consequences.
Five years ago -- admitted, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at his high point in career -- the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent. However, now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of the votes were secure.
The CSU was a 46-year-old "allein director" in Bavaria, which produces 18 percent of German GDP.
The conservatives remain the decisive force in which the Hungarian economy also plays an important role, but they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the internal restructurings, the potential successor Huber, Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the research team, which will lead the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "Free Voter" polling on a possible Munich coalition.
One irony of fate is that with the list of "Free voters", that Gabriele Pauli enters the Legislature, whose anti-stobes appear the Huber-Beckstein Duo first used to look at the goalless politician.
The CSU leadership now concentrates all its forces on the stabilization of Becksteins.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who so far pulled the threads out of the background, will become an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU president called on September 28th the "big day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made some toxic remarks towards CDU - in his view the CSU would have earned much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has contributed a great deal to success at national level in 2005, is not put back on its legs with a common force, Merkel cannot be a chancellor again after the German elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who from her disappointment over the Fiasko, did not make a hill, believes that the land loss of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukaschenko Opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, there was no representative of the opposition in the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is the state of prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukaschenko, but the OECD suspects that there is legislative contradictions in the number of votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
The legislature of the 10 million resident state has come out without opposition for decades. However, the opposition party, which has been gathered before the contested elections under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS), has seriously hoped that Lukaschenko, who has renewed his presidency for the fourth time in the course of the unholy elections and a constitutional amendment in 2006, would "allow" some members of the opposition in Parliament this time.
That's why the ODS even took a distance from the pre-planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming more and more dependent on the increasing prices of gas imports from Russia, and even credit has been taken to alleviate price increases, and the country has also agreed to the Russians to sell the Beltrans gas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading by the country. Thus, in the light of the opposition's expectations, Ukraine wanted to improve its relationship with the EU, after Lukaschenko and other high-ranking politicians have banned entry as an anti-democratic political system in the EU.
For temporary relaxation, the OECD election evaluation report, in which emphasis was placed on the positive movements rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report criticised the campaign already Monday - therefore opposition should not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition should not be present when counting the votes.
Despite the fact that the opposition has been able to recognise an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been placed on a free footing, and Minsk is even more willing to confront Moscow by continuing to reject the recognition of the independence of the despicable Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federative state on the paper, has been considered independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important is that dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our blog.
According to the 2006 presidential election candidate, it is desirable to continue, although "the mighty have got the fear of leaving only one opposition to Parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest measures in view of the results, but rather attempts to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We have many problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the way when selling stones, but I still see that more and more people support change, even older ones," said Milinkewitsch, pointing out that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agree with the Lukaschenko regime, whose sole merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the debt of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" that begins to break down at the silence of a cemetery," said Milinkewitsch.
In contrast to opposition politicians, Russian observers have referred to the elections as democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, stated the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe the facts, not the words." The absence of the opposition was therefore a proof of the ripening of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on we're getting breakfast before work"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are rotatable doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
From now on, the measure will enter into force against those slummers who will only stamp out and then go for coffee drinks during working hours.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, the Minister for Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
">"Treatable doors are a means to increase labour efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," says Brunetta once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
Masi refers to this: "The choice of the rotatable doors is also of great symbolic value".
On the part of the officials there was no resistance, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides".
So all in all there is now no breakfast during the working time; close with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises about this with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the High Committee of the Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Administration)
from Rome, the Minister announces that "within three months the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, which means 60,000 people per year are more present at work".
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy
"their pay dynamics - as the Minister has said - have been twice as large in the last 8-10 years as the private sector and far above the inflation rate."
In the meantime, thousands of officials have joined in opposing the Brunetta Decree as part of the Codacons-supported profession.
"While the Minister for Public Service is profiled with numbers of lower absences at work - as the consumer centre writes - the people of the 'active faulpelze' grow uninterruptedly.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have joined in declaring war against the law."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is being combated for additional financial compensation for work-related diseases, and the planned extension of the compulsory pension of the sick worker is also called for, while the control visits can be made and further aspects of the Minister's innovations are called for.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents at work is crucial"
Every day there were 2500 accidents at work in Italy, three people died and 27 people were left with disabilities.
For the year 2007, the data of Inail (Instituto nazionale contro inforuni sul trabajo) confirm that the fatal accidents at about 1200 occurred.
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that almost doubles the number of deaths caused by murder.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will take place in all provinces of Italy on the 58th National Day for Victims of Work Accidents to draw the attention of the social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The data provided by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del trabajo) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention of jobs, the protection of injured workers, the assistance for the families of victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"An empirical "Basta" has risen to this; of course, in tragedies that, measured at their size, trigger some spindles in the media and public participation. But the everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even be repeated in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "in any case there is also a resource problem: there must be a decisive investment in education and information."
There are a number of initiatives that are particularly important for a more direct awareness of the school environment by young people who are getting closer to the world of work.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to detract from its social seriousness.
On the other hand, the President of the House, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of labour-related deaths is an urgent social emergency, which affects the conscience of all of us and forces all of us to work on certain rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
"The data on accidents at work seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not mean that the number of accidents at work is too high," says President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive trend" to mean less attention. That's exactly what ultimately causes tragedy."
"How do you think you're actually doing too little to deal with the phenomenon of accidents?
Stronger controls and inspections are necessary in our opinion – Mercandelli, but also stronger measures to clarify the workers who are already starting in school."
"An additional effort is necessary - he adds - as regards communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, there is a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers to a phenomenon that is a social emergency."
Mercandelli also referred to "the progressive deterioration of the protection of victims of accidents at work" and called for "the abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the worker a guarantee of insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident of work does not depend on voluntary or accidental donations that are decided by a legislator from time to time."
Mp3 player in charge: danger of hearing damage
Listening to music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which, in a report published today in Brussels, cites the opinion of the EU's Csseri (Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks).
"From the report – as it is said in a note – it becomes clear that 5-10% of those who hear music with portable musical instruments for at least five years longer than an hour a day risking permanent loss of their hearing."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who usually place portable music devices and phones on a high volume, their hearings without knowing it irreversibly damaging," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings – that is, since the eu – there is a clear risk that acts too quickly.
What really matters is to sensitize consumers and make this information into a community.
In view of this scientific knowledge, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology".
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people.
"Scientists - so close the EU's communication - confirm that you are fairly concerned and that the European Commission, together with the other members of the European Union and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable musical devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB. The concern about the damage that could result from excessive noise.
These damage can be very limited in which solutions such as noise reduction and the length of noise exposure can be taken into account.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the Eu points out that when users of portable music devices hear music only five hours a week (less than 89 decibels) so that the legal limits are already exceeded which apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who exceed this limit risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
So this is 5-10% of the users of such devices, whose number can be estimated to be between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the Eu.
Rome, Germany gives the start committee to the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, in March it will be over, in June it will be taken into account.
This is the outcome set out in the chapter for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the capital of Rome". The Commission met this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla.
In six months President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the city and municipality will evaluate the analyses and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the capital and the mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," says Germany. "It will make proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders remain in charge of the city and community.
There is no re-allocation of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where you can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will be relaunched, as such a project must have a temporary end point.
In June, as announced by the mayor, we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work carried out by the Commission."
Those who question the competence of the Commission because their view of obligation is lacking, says Germano: "Everything depends on the work which the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, like in France, she delivers quality results – and this will certainly be in Rome – then her contribution will be fundamental.
The policy is too often concerned with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the other hand, we want to have a longer period in view to work with a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city".
The mayor of Rome values the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a robbery: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to mind. It will occupy the best heads of the capital".
According to Germanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetical nor static to allow our city a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a common step into the future".
A future, the mayor of Rome, which "will not only restrict itself to the present municipal borders, but will continue to be much more visible", not only as regards the role of Rome as a metropolis and the political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here's a statement
A well-known American politician, who has much to do with being considered independent, wrote: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who disembarked the US economy through his decisions and maintained the relationship with the demise of Islam (and still does this as a private man today).
The attacks on Obama are getting stronger, right now, where the elections are approaching.
A woman from Miami wrote on an Internet site: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very frequent: he thinks he will be given the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!".
However, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there are also the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with great advantage.
In this case, too, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in her editorial: only in the election booth will we know who will give his voice to the true American patriot.
Here comes a mentality of the United States, which has been kept hidden until recently.
"Say what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our crusades, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we'll get out of America.
Something you never heard before – just now, where the success of the black candidate seems so secure.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the ultimate weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his term of office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a walk in the back.
In Iraq 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weakness.
The one who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
Fifty-five American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about their situation and mental control of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they explained that the information concerning the competent authorities was not really concerned about the general credibility.
They don't feel as alone as before.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed for these journalists.
In addition, the major problems arising from the cuts in the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work, in order to compile the newspaper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved – as the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the great audience understands it, from shrinking substantially.
A clear but complicated pessimism is fulfilling the American journalist today.
Six of ten journalists and executive seniors of the press believe that journalism is on the wrong track at national level.
In the local area, the executives are even 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine what direction the web is going in.
The main publishing groups are on their way to the Internet, which is viewed by many as the "killer" of the press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping "they will bring some good for journalism".
The biggest rice is in American journalism today between the chief editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of heads of directors at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level only 23%.
Some think it has to do with "security in work."
The managers who are afraid to lose their work within three years are 47% at national level.
Of the journalists, there are 30%.
The theme of "safer work" in the team (our "editors", note d. Red.) is always a current theme in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, such as the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV broadcasters and Internet operators, employers offer as they like and so it will be a question of taking it or leaving it.
The editors get very often very high wages, but the editor can sometimes only get 10000 euros per month, including pension and insurance payments.
With regard to vacation, the matter is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, as well as so many after the third, to finally reach after a certain number of years 15 days of vacation.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, are often "sick" during the year.
It's a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: JERICHT IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA LIMITT IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Chamber of the Court of Justice in Rome, Carmelo Rinaoud, decided to reject the application of the real estate agent, who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola because of its bankruptcy in the context of the counter-agreement investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was turned into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate broker to be transferred from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the Court of Justice, such representations (against which the Public Prosecutor had expressed itself) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to obtain evidence from him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already appeared some days ago when the Chamber of Representatives voted against the 700 billion-dollar savings package of the White House: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than the economy.
This confirms the harsh edition of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis in the course of the process is being carried out by the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and modern East Coast soul, which has always benefited the state institutions and the business community and those neoconservatives, which are "in Washington" and the financial world, and, for example, winning in the south and in the centre of the electoral states.
This part of the party thanks to its rise, for example, the voice I mentioned above.
This just mentioned example is just a small part of the major changes that announce the current economic earthquake or even present it: not only in the USA, even in the whole West, but perhaps beyond these will be affected.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the long-feared events that finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the re-discovery, the uninterrupted renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in the banking and financial institutions that have close connections to the rest of the world and at the same time manage a disproportionate amount of the assets of private households living in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for governments: that is how the families in question are treated, which is also a huge voter mass.
So the crisis appears to be economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have turned aside and lost its right of speech: the clear evidence for this has been given by the EU, which, due to its duplication in various national and international conflicts, is not known to find a common way.
Therefore, all of us are now counting on the intervention of our own country; rescue plans, new rules, and, for example, the distribution of aid funds: since the crisis has become more and more serious, only the United States is able to save itself in the economic situation without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use them: therefore, two conditions that are not overestimable – in certain circumstances – which may not otherwise be possible for an international organisation or for a market in a similar way.
The new emphasis that is placed on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that will be linked in the economy to a more closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxer's way is just now, when we were so convinced of it, to be in a networked totality for the longest time, in a wealth of ever differentiated technologies, of the immaterial that we have to find out at once how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although they can all be transported from one place to the other in the world, they are still at the very end connected with a closely defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, one who has such a territory is in favour of another who lives in a land free of disturbance, waterless or oil-free environment.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short incision.
Who's territory, who's government, who says politics, that's what Leadership says.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for leadership, so the need for someone who knows how to handle things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of equipment on existing routes, such as those of the economy, which have emerged as insufficient and full shadows.
Finally, there is a deeper richer and in some sense even more disturbing: a loss of confidence, an indictability, an image of insatiability, a feeling of distance that is all about a whole class of managers of the Western countries.
It seems thus that the conviction of the majority of the population seems to guide the way that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but it is already their idea world, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is the majority as always foreign and superior.
The demand for leadership is therefore undermining a demise but powerful movement of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This occurs in the unforeseeable "revolves" of voters and in the unmistakably changing collective mood of the last time: beginning with the rise of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain, towards the rebellion of US MPs against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the rights in Italy here plays a role).
One wins the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, magazines, intellectual believers, some would say their format, increasingly problems of understanding, and therefore less representative value in terms of what is happening today in the lower social layers of the West and is still strengthened by the financial crisis and driven to over-dimensionality.
In view of all this, it would simply be exaggeration to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping the eyes open is certainly not.
The superclipper that leaves up the walls
The forces of gravity can be overcome by a adhesive and can climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four U.S. research centres, one of which seems to be almost focused on the goal.
With an area of only 2.5 qcm glue, the researchers managed to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – has an American magazine, has published the results of researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which uses a special carbon structure called carbon nanopipes.
"The principle of glue can be represented as a series of tubular tubes arranged by a stack of spaghetti," says Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic herbs, which give the animal a perfect stop.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the stamina of the Reptilian feet and at the same time "lets remove troublelessly from the wall", says Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
AN MAUERN ENLANGWANDERN? "This material could be used as a transmissible adhesive," Liming Dai adds.
Somehow like Spiderman to import walls? Perhaps already, but researchers are thinking of less fascinating benefits, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanopipes are also leaders of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall in the area of space transport.
So for the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER ART OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new kind of glue.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present a adhesive made of microfibres that clean themselves like hair by moving on a surface of dust itself and thus maintain a perfect liability.
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness in the summer, may cause serious health damage when taken with certain vital medicines, as they may have an extreme effect on the absorption of them by the body.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of both packaged and fresh fruit products in conjunction with drug intake. As part of the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again sounded alarm: There is enough a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital drugs to the extent that they are practically eliminated and thus endanger the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, anti-asthmatics, heart circulation drugs, anxiolytic and neurological resources, to toxic levels.
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.
ES IS NOT GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice contain substances that may inhibit medicines.
The list of active substances covered by fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the call by Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually transmitted immediately to the various international manufacturers, who are so free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended that you always read the package leaflet and, if there is still any uncertainty, do not have a shame to ask a pharmacologist or doctor," says Ansa Agency expert.
Economics Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The economics prize is at the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of Enron’s collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times headline that this second event was more decisive for the history of the United States than the Attents.
A forecast that has not received little controversy in response and that the economy has been held back years later, but it is now quite right.
"I'm surprised and also shocked at how fast the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public view," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economy of great value", but also a banalizer with a "very aggressive style that is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, the third version of the Anti-Microsoft package appears
The day of the publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source software wins as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office an ever-increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among liberators and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself with some news to the public: in addition to a revised and now more spartan-designed start menu, it is now finally one of the reasons for ensuring compatibility with Apple's Mac OS x operating system, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Eight against the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as the one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitates sending via email. This also includes the possibility of importing PDF files into the graphic editing module and at the same time preserving the original page appearance image.
Thus, "hybride" PDF files can also be generated, which expand the typical graphics of the Adobe format around the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the strongest elements of the applications: tables can now be processed by multiple users, thereby avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the text processing system, each editor will be asked to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are just about to publish various functions of OpenOffice on the cloud on the Internet, while in the coming weeks the final result should be made public.
The Italian version is available on the following link to download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. It follows the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
Upon request, you can send the installation CD home or to the office.
In order to encourage the distribution of the program to private households, it is also in the business area where OpenOffice could succeed in the big project: various public administration and schools have already been transferred to OpenOffice.
In fact, it is not even missing from a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus opens even business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the word corresponding to the text editing program; Calc, the table program that aims to force Excel; Impress, to create presentations like with Powerpoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of the more familiar access; and lastly, Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for the year 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded by 3 million and 600 thousand now.
Also coal tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens up to me as part of the last tour of France: it is the Austrian sportsman Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is a third-class winner and winner of the trikot of the best climber.
The message was published in the daily newspaper L'Equipe on her website.
The 26-year-old coal from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver who was tested positive for Cera, the Epo of the third generation. Previously, this happened with the Italians Ricardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analysis of the blood samples of coals included those performed in the last few weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the countertests now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrians will lose their third place and will be excluded from the race for two years.
The chief of the French Anti-Doping Commission Pierre Bordy confirmed the positive epoch, and the Austrian authorities also reportedly, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian came behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans on the podium and also claimed the trikot of the best climber for himself.
THEME IMPLEMENTATION: THE NEW YORK TEMES QUESTION: IS ITALIAN RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the single country of immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only being taken up by opposition.
Does this make a nation of racists from the Belpaese? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article devoted entirely to the subject of racism in Italy and comes out of the case of a young man named Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after he had stolen a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times refers to as the "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and employment" and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiment and the greatest support of the North Lega".
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times draws on other episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation, introduced by the lega against immigration and the faster designation of illegal immigrants, is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also underlines the Pope and the President of the State: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal to cooperate between the Church and the State in combating racism."
Student victims of up to 900 Euros per room high rental price
The housing market for students does not know any crises.
According to the last study of Sunia, the rental company, a single room can cost up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken up very difficult moves. A lot of students lose their right to study so effectively because their families are not able to support them in this amount" – according to Sunia’s supervisor Laura Mariani – "in these cities the large demand from students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also damaged the other residents.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, lack of registrations, without price limits, unauthorized rentals.
For the Sunia, there is the need for exceptional measures leading to a revision of taxation at lower rental prices.
For more detailed consideration of the investigation, it appears that in Milan a sleeping space is needed in the area of Brianza approximately 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the district of Bande Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the area of Lambie, Udine and Fiera or even 900 euros in the district of Vittoria.
In Florence, an average sleeping area costs 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the districts around the university, 250/280 euros are for a sleeping area of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices are around the Union for a single room, 450 for a bedroom in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rentals in the districts around the other universities of Rome: 550 Euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those outside the district can save money: 300 Euros for a sleeping area and 450 Euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping area, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive areas, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleeping area costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smaller cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting to foreign students is more frequent, as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rental that is 25-30% above average is required by foreign students.
By looking again at the old cinema paradise – the cities close their historic cinema halls
The historical cinemas are closed because of the favored multiplexkinos.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This image of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the large urban centers of Italy, as well as in the provinces.
The process of demarcation of the cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-saal complex in the periphery, means long-term death for the single-saalkino in the center. A process that not only appears to be impermissible and irrevocable, but also carries the trains of a cultural crime.
Most of the historical places of memories are affected: "It is like losing a friend, with which you have returned a piece of road full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oscar and the great price of Cannes 20 years ago. It is the story of a pre-city cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a probably forever lost cinematel.
The figures supplied by the Anec, the central trade union, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the untimely quantities of 316 traditional cinemas have to be closed; these drawings paid mostly the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions include Emilia Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This proves that the main debtors are the multiplexkinos, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, the Lombardy leads the lists, 81 are both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful that new structures are also emerging, but first of all, the preservation of the existing one, because it closes a hall in the city, not all of his family customers are ready to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
There is still the missing state for the commercial association fund, with the government's debt burden of about 10 million euros.
It is a violation of the ethical-moral position that the government does not observe the existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be needed in the year".
It is interesting to note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to the fears of the old cinemas, decided to protect it through an agreement between the community and the Anec; it is the first such agreement in Italy, which aims to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
The measures envisaged also include tax advantages for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in relation to proximity: it will be allowed to drive in the traffic restricted areas of the centre and also to park for more favourable parking charges.
"It is a happy initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also develop new concepts.
But of course, we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to focus on the superpower of the multiplexs, as the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of the traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "supercinema" of Baghaira, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to establish the "Newo cinema Paradise" even though I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have been living in Rome; if I pass through the Rialto or Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side so that I do not have to see the dust-covered poster.
The links between politics and 'ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to adjust the decisions of the community to the interests of the Mafia group Piromelli.
The charges against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his representative Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for the development of mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromelli, the senior mediator between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew, was also taken into custody: the lawyer, who bears the same names as the boss of the clan, had already been convicted for the development of criminal associations of the Mafia, at that time to an amount of compensation of EUR 10 million.
"Any kind of moral and legal norm mindless," the lawyers wrote, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromelli money for consulting activities."
"So the Mafia Group was made possible – thus the judges – to officially enter the Council houses and agree on public administration policies."
The president of the Committee of the Regions, Agazio Loiro, in his region, does not deny that "all other than an exception is to strike links between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others, in which such links are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of 'ndrangheta: heroes who get a white West."
The arrests of this morning follow those of the last July, with which the Piromelli clan police were excommunicated.
Since the end of April, the municipality of Gioia Tauro has been dissolved, but in 1991 – and also at that time due to alleged links between organised crime and local administration – local politicians of their community have been removed.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of Udc, was elected as head of the Central Committee after the election of May 2006.
He screamed when the prefecture arranged the settlement of the municipality.
He was interested in the vice-minister Marco Minniti, who decided to have invented everything for political and strategic reasons. However, the judges explain in connection with the arrest warrant this morning that the Piromelli-Clan had even dared to apply for an amendment to the A3 project.
A consultation on the Dal Torreone case investigations has shown the willingness to respond to the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – which has made the public administration's actions identical with the interests of this clan."
When energy comes out of the waves, the big ones suddenly run on
It is a non-performing source of money that covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and only now seems to understand the world's large energy companies.
Waves, currents and currents are the new renewable energy sources that are now all looking for, and also seeking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of acquiring energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years, and these studies have not been substantially intensified since the first earthquake.
When the oil price fell by 1980, the idea of marine energy was forgotten, but now the environmental organisations and the increased oil price are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the global energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by the oceans.
This is equivalent to the double energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and currents are still coming.
Giants on the attack.
The first company, which now operates on marine energy, is Enersis, which signed in 2005 a contract establishing a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy sector that focus on marine energy generation.
"Chevron investigates these technologies" – the speaker of a company known as the American giant in the Wall Street Journal – and hesitates to cooperate with us."
This is about obtaining approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project on the coast of Alaska.
This is a non-estimating sign, e.g. when you think that oil is still being promoted by the United States in Alaska and President Bush recently put the plans for new drilling in progress.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new sector; the details are also not known, but observers say of an increasing interest.
Even better technologies.
Experts speak of a technology that is still emerging, which is not last, as the last doubts of environmental protection have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy to a large extent, technologies with far greater environmental impact are needed.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power uses, for example, a system of interconnected Bojen.
The foam of the waves that move the bojens up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmers over flasks and cylinders.
This one drives a turbine, which then drives a generator.
The current is sent to the coast via underwater pipelines.
Up to now, there are four planned facilities of this kind, which are only waiting for the state's approval, and some of the energy generated could also be used for military institutions.
Verdant Power is already producing energy for a shopping house and parking with underground turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the seasons are driving the turbines, which feed the generator through the rotating motion.
According to Verdand, a long chain of potential customers is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
Only the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Recovery, a particular interest is currently worth the potential that lies in the times.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the times are better predictable than wind currents, sunlight and also waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely what the federal states, such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million have already been planned for 2009.
