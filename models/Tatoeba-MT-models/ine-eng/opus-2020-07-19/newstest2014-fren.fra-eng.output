Spectacular salt in "wingsuit" above Bogota
Sportsman Jonathan Florez jumped Thursday from a helicopter above Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a moon combination of wings), it passed to 160 km/h above the famous holy Monserrate, located more than 3,000 metres high, where many Badads gathered to observe its operation.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners find it hard to find the money needed to repair the decommissioned motorway infrastructure, many are those who discuss a solution in the form of a small black box that is located above your car's boardboard.
The devices, which record every mile through a car driver and transmit the information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to maintain the obsolete system of financing major American roads.
The sector generally lacks interest in the planning of the major axes has suddenly led to a strong animated debate and moving alliances.
The liberators have joined environmentalist groups to pressure the government to use small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly of the road on which you travel, then use the information to write a bill.
Tea Party is landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress are not able to agree to whether to continue, several States have not waited.
They are looking for how, during the next decade, they will be able to move to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of thousands of journeys.
Thousands of motorists have already loaded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental turn.
This is truly essential to our nation.
"It's not like we had the choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, director-general of the Southern California Association of Governments, which provides that the state will start recording thousands of roads by each California driver by 2025.
There's going to be a change in how we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed by taxes paid by Americans to the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much fuel as they used to.
Cars can travel more than a mile with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Political men are reluctant to increase the tax, even 1 cent, while fuel prices are high.
"The fuel tax is simply not tenacious," said Lee Munnich, a specialist in transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
His State recently installed tractors on 500 cars to test a mill payment system.
"This will be the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Wunks calls it the cost of using a kilometer.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces the citizens' liberals, as taxes could be used to change the behavioural habits in order to reduce the fillings and emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the State's ambitious climate heating laws.
However, representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Committee on the Transport of the House of Representatives, said that he also considered it the most viable alternative in the long term.
The free market participants of the Reasons Foundation also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay a mile.
"It's not just a tax going on in a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of the Policy at the Reasonon Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they are being provided.
The movement was also supported by two former US transport secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go the way of payment to the mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90M pilot project last year that would have carried about 10,000 cars.
But the Presidency of the House killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who must spend many thousands of days going to work or in the city.
Several States and large cities, however, are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the country's most important experience.
These drivers will soon pay the State of Kilometric Fees instead of fuel taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York is considering one.
Illinois is trying a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in States off the coast, is American (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) studying how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their least facts and practices.
"The concerns about Big Brother and this kind of thing are a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who runs the strategic management of performance in the Nevada Transportation Department.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the test, Nevada's ACLU warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-scale location devices."
There is no need to build an enormous and comprehensive technological infrastructure that will be inevitably expanded to preserve the recording of the trips and daily arrivals of people.
Nevada is one of the few States that are moving now to find an affordable technology that would allow the State to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact location or the exact time.
If we can do this, Khan added, the citizens will be more at ease.
Research of this technology has led some state agencies to appeal to a small start-up of California called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help car drivers paying taxes to States.
She was looking for a search in the emerging car insurance market, in which drivers would pay on the basis of their mileage.
But the devices it tests have plenty to schedule large axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't record their speed and do not locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Director General of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are far less expensive means and far less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try to experience by offering different choices to motorists.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have any equipment at all, preferring to pay a fee based on the average number of thousands of travels by all residents of the State.
Other States hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transport managers are trying to develop a tax facility that would also be equipped to pay parking charges, provide a "car payment" insurance and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid bottlenecks.
"Car drivers would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them," said a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder if all the debate on the payment of a mile is not simply a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay Area, the officials say that Congress could manage the failure of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on fuel.
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and on other vehicles with low fuel consumption, so that each pays its own share.
"There is no need to resort to radical surgery when we simply need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs with the Commission.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: four unpublished listening
The English musician has not finished surprising this year.
From The Next Day, released in January, he concoctioned a luxury edition scheduled for 4 November, with several unpublisheds.
Four have already emerged on the Table.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left the whole world panicked.
On the day of his 66th anniversary, on January 8, 2013, he stated that a new album would come out in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, date 2003) and too rare appearances in public, English musician proved that he could still be counted on to spark the pop scene.
A party for his fans
No surprises, David Bowie had more than one tour in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke thus planned to re-edit this album on 4 November.
For the occasion, he had a real feast for his fans.
This recast, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three disks: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already opened.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional songs compared to the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially released for the occasion, as well as two replays.
David Bowie also made presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces each of the disks, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pockets, a book to share its own impressions, a book with words...
And, above all, it gives a taste of its new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very early guitars and a highly controlled rock electricity.
Already Listening to Inedibles
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal her charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the canvas.
The Informer is double-faced: a disturbing intro before a light cavalcade that slows down gradually to leave space for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to the Rocket Man of Elton John, or even Gravity?
With this title played, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on earth.
Space Oddy, on the other hand, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie makes a new reference to his alienity: would he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, sending, give you the desire to leave the Earth.
Bowie has fun playing the chameleon with these titles: a tour informant, a man on board a rifle, martian potential...
He dissimulates and reveals both, plays to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, especially with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photography of the campaign The Invitation to Travel, of the Louis Vuitton brand, whose new face he incarnates.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, released from 10 November.
The Minister of Defence Rob Nicholson insisted that the wounded soldiers were not completely released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transitional process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to life.
Attacked by the liberals and neo-democratics in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, members of the army followed a transitional plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to life and none of them is released before being ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured soldiers - who do not meet the rule of the army's "university of service" requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for pension benefits.
In particular, they cited two cases reported by the Canadian Press, including one of the released soldiers on Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a London reservist in Ontario, was released from the army despite his request to remain a year longer in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed to the exit before being ready because he did not respond to the universality rule of service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultations, but that it was completely different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said during an interview with the Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was any way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major struggles in Afghanistan, the army has hardly been able to determine the latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks but who are not fit to fight.
Under the current rules, soldiers have been severely injured for up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data submitted last year to Parliament indicate that among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 did not reach the service period required to obtain pension benefits.
The Liberal spokesperson for former combatants, Jim Karagiannis, asked for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins on Wednesday, while the neo-democratic Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney on the tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to favour the tablets on its own television channels for the next release of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on the watchdisneyjunior.com site or via its application for phones and tablets.
Its global launch on Disney Group chains is scheduled only in 2014, details the communication of its Disney Junior Division.
The animated drawing, for children 2 to 7 years of age, tells the adventures of the Callie chat, sheriff of a city of the American West where it regulates the order with a magical lasso.
Each episode contains two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, vice president of Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the communiqué.
This type of experience comes within Disney's efforts to "extend the life span of its series and build new relationships with its audience through increasingly important digital platforms", he added.
A survey published early in the week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion of the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of the under 2 years of age had already been used with a tablet or phone, and 72% of the under 8 years of age, respectively, 10% and 38% two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, the denouncing U.S. information services, said that he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the United States National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers to their activities.
German Member Hans-Christian Ströbele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was entitled to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts has been positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a fugitive and seeks to penalise the political speech with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he felt that the support of the international community could persuade the American government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
In the context of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, it is accused of espionage and theft of property of the State.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the German Interior, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will make it possible."
The relationship between the United States and Germany was severely tested following complaints that the NSA had been listening to the mobile phone from the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who runs the parliamentary group to oversee foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance of hearing Mr. Snowden as a witness "without putting him in danger and completely ruining relations with the United States", he had to take advantage of it.
Mr Ströbele, German MP Vert, posted a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
On his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the former NSA consultant's lawyer, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden witnessed in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be "safe" there, he said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a "severe and sustained persecution" campaign that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the global response to "my political expression."
The citizens of the world, as well as the top leaders – including the United States – considered the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance to be of public service.
The letter makes an offer of cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved”.
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and the latest video service on request via their TV in a future that doesn't seem so far.
Cogeco's branch indicated Thursday that it was currently conducting preliminary testing of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to develop more friendly interfaces and more options," explained the president and head of the management of Cogeco, Louis Audet, in an interview.
Cogeco Cable thus moves the step towards its competitors, like Bell, even though the Cogeco branch has not yet specified date on this new platform.
"We need to adapt and change or resist change and failure," said Mr. Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our customers currently do not have access to.
The Rogers telecommunications giant has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which were not mentioned, could be regulated.
In the United States, the popular video service says to be in discussions with some major cable distributors to make its service available through their broadcasting platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable’s p.d.g. also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during his talk on the Throne last October 16th.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite TV providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for the services on the map.
"It is almost two and a half years ago that we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important chains is not working," said Mr. Audet.
However, he hoped that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council (CRTC) would lead to interesting recommendations.
"It will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of new reference framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy on television," said Cogeco's father.
The CRTC has conducted consultations with the public since last week and should continue with the industry in the next spring.
On the side of the results, Cogeco indicated that it had recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82¢ by action.
This is a reduction compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83¢ by action, of the same period last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this decline by cost of depreciation related to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the Atlantic Broadband cable distributor, established in the United States, for $1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the failure in Portugal.
In December, the Montenal Society also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet provider established in Vancouver, for the amount of 526 million.
As for Cogeco's income, they had a growth of 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They amount to 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90¢ by action, in decline from 45.7 million, or 93¢ by action, in the same period last year.
Cogeco Cable's income, however, has grown by 45% to reach 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers during the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of customers of Cogeco Cable is increasing by 5546.
Mr. Audet is not worried about seeing the number of customers fluctuate like that.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, has he observed.
It varies from one quarter to another with a very lively competition.
Horse in beef products
The horse meat was found in cattle-based containers, sold by two small British low-price distribution teachers, today announced the food hygiene agency.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save channels, contained 1 to 5% horse DNA.
"Because horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the British agency explained.
A scandal on the presence of horse meat in cooked foods broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to the European Commission's reviews, France was the country's most affected by the presence of such meat in products intended to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles caused four injuries, early Friday, on road 131, in Lanaudière.
Just before 4 o'clock, a motorist traveling north, in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and hit a car that arrived in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid for their lives.
The traffic returned to normal at 6:00 p.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to make luggage pay by hand
Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 to passengers who carry luggage by hand on their flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start making up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could bring the unopened canteen with them to the plane's descent.
The new hand luggage costs cover the bags in the upper compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said she would pay $25 if the charges were paid in advance and $100 if the passengers paid only once at the port of boarding.
Frontier's spokesman, Kate O'Malley, indicated that $100 was planned to encourage travellers to pay the costs in advance.
"We do not want to pay this price," she explained.
Air carriers began to pay the first and second baggage registered in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these charges put as much stuff as they could in hand luggage in the upper compartments, so there was often no more room in these compartments.
These charges are a means of ensuring that passengers carry fewer items on board.
O'Malley said that these new charges would not really be used to collect money.
This is to make it clear to the most loyal Frontier customers that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find the place in the superior compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline's site will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger who makes the queue at a Frontier boarding door could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers know the existence of these costs before they reach the door.
Frontier baggage costs will not be applied before summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage maintenance costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay.
Many people at Wall Street consider adding baggage costs as a sign that air companies pay cheap enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, many of them did not touch baggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand luggage charges three years ago, and the Allegiant low-cost company followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant to airline Jay Sorensen, who follows the additional costs.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that the cost of baggage by Spirit was $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines framework, recently traveled on Spirit and asked what he was going to find at the boarding door when passengers would discover the unusual baggage costs imposed by the company.
"I've never seen a boarding procedure so fluid in my entire professional career," he said.
I was hoping to see a toothbrush and a squeezing bag at the door.
The plane was full, he added, "passengers are on board at the speed of light."
Frontier also makes like Spirit and applies $2 for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can carry the unopened canteen with them, and those who take coffee can be reserved for free.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to pay for the drinks in 2008 but returned seven months later after the passengers complained and no other large airline followed.
Frontier's decision to pay baggage costs by hand when passengers do not buy their ticket directly to the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go to his site.
Air companies pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of addressing an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, she began offering only half a mile of loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced the premium of thousands of 25% on a trip.
Thus, a 1 000-mile border trip purchased from an online travel agency would make 250-miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in his hometown, Denver, but his activity retreats and she loses money.
Revenue fell by 9 per cent and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent during the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its mother, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic attempted to re-establish Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
NSA calls into question a "internal error" and not computer pirates for its site's web site panel
The National Security Agency working in the shadow said Friday that it was a bug that had caused the panic of its public site for a few hours, and not of hackers like some who claimed it online.
"The NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update," said the spy agency in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the panel was due to a devious attack of distributed service [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, the online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been on board for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromises.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson explained.
At least one group of online activists claimed to be responsible for the NSA's site panel by a DSD attack.
The DSD attacks aim to launch a targeted site until servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber tactics are not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the target system.
The NSA had previously been extremely secretive, a time named "No Such Agency", has been found under the fire of projectors and has been strongly criticised in recent months as a result of a wave of revelations about its extensive national and foreign communications monitoring programs – which are part of the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the former consultant disembarked by the NSA, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency caused many speculations that the incident of the night was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Delta Centre-Ville is now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montréal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who would turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Among them, 200 have not yet found a new job.
Delta promises not to let his employees fall.
Employers came to meet employees directly on the spot, employees were met individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains the Regional Director of the Delta Hotel Relations, Félix Bisson.
The closing of Delta takes place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
Whether he reinvested in the building to continue operating it, so there were tens of millions of investments while the competition is very fair, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
"Or he sold it to someone else, and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM Science School.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for older people.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be the day of two years.
For Titan's PDG, "the Goodyear Amiens purchase project starts with zero employees"
After having released the release with failure in January for partial resumption of the Goodyear of Amiens-Nord site promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the PDG of the American pneumatic Titan, states today that it is ready to save 333 jobs on the 1 137 that counts the factory.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced it on Monday, 21 October.
After giving up the plant purchase project in January, you come back today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" per day, of "false" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this face-to-face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Work seven hours a day when in other countries eight hours are working in France.
In India, China, and many other countries, ten to twelve hours a day work.
But I have no prejudice on France.
What I see is a plant that manufactures good agricultural tyres, has good equipment, is well located and has space to expand.
Why does Titan need this plant so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this plant.
But with the right price and competent workers, it's worth trying.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the plant, Goodyear had offered the employees a good start compensation, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys the factory closed at Goodyear.
At the same time, Titan could move the machines to Poland or to any other country of the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the Amiens plant with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them among some 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
Mr Montebourg also needs a Titan commitment before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is for the CGT and Goodyear to enter into an agreement on the starting allowances for all employees.
Then there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said that you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on the starting allowances.
If all employees accept them, the plant purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we provide long-term guarantees when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg finds out that the CGT and Goodyear agree and that Titan buys the plant, we have a strong intention to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
The benefits of Bombardier are low, while air delivery and orders are declining.
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian air and rail manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent drop in its net profit on Thursday, under the pressure of lower orders and delivery of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montréal, has no longer provided flight test data for its new new CSeries aircraft or information to determine whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial service schedule before next September.
After the inaugural flight of the test plane about a month and a half ago, the pilot only stole three times, and then the question was asked whether the test phase was in the right direction.
The results were not expected and the rate of action declined by 8 per cent to the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank of Finance, reduced his rating on Thursday, from "surperformance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential increase in the stock exchange during the next quarter or two quarters.
"Although the drop in air delivery has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport Division," said Cameron Doerksen in a note to customers.
We believe that Bombardier will record new commands for its CSeries aircraft as the pilot program will advance.
However, if no new orders have been announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family will be able to catapult it in the lower segment of today's market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was detonated in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries planes is modest so far to the height of 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding energy efficiency and the potential of the new airline's economies.
Currently, the company has recorded a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, president and head of management, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft commercial service.
The leaders also reassured the analysts and the media on Thursday, indicating that the program was advancing according to the timetable.
"The test aircraft did not remain on the ground longer than expected," said Mr. Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that the ground tests and software updates were planned during the flight stop time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take the first flight and provide for an update period, and that is what we did.
This will take place throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test planes should fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly thereafter, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first client can only fly a CSerius plane 12 months after his inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that she was assessing the schedule of entry into service and will provide further information in the coming months.
"This slowing of flight tests – although it is apparently consistent with Bombardier's internal calendar – strengthens our view that the entry into service will be restored in the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter closes on September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents by action, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents by action, a year earlier.
The result by adjusted action remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Income decreased slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 Md.
Analysts were expected to result in 10 cents per action and income of $4.56 Md, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world indicated that he had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared with 57 a year earlier.
Net orders are dropped to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics Division was $32.9 Md as at 30 September, an unchanged figure compared to 31 December of the previous year.
"In Aeronautics, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and the general market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Aeronautics revenues fell by 13 per cent to $2 Md.
Bombardier, the largest railway manufacturer in the world, said that the revenues of this division had increased from nearly 11% to $2.1 billion.
The Transport Division's order book totaled $32.6 billion as of 30 September, or a slight increase compared to 31 December of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division have suffered execution problems for some large contracts.
The leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
The course of Bombardier's actions, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, head of the financial management of Google Inc, would be in the board of directors, dropped from 8.5% to $4.83 Canadian dollars in the afternoon of Thursday.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third aircraft manufacturer in the world and the closest competitor to Bombardier, reported a 10% reduction in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two Spelologists from 23 and 27 years of age were taken missing in a dyke under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday night, we learned Friday with the Speléo rescue of Iser.
They were located this Friday-after afternoon.
The two men, one in practice and the other in practice, went underground on Thursday at 21:30 a.m. to perform a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located on the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We've been out of the news since then, has explained the same source.
"Spelegologists should have pointed out around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, a technical advisor to Speléo relief in charge of the relief organization.
Tens of persons on site
Twenty rescuers, ten members of the French Speleo rescue team, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were in place.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It's another group of speculators who, after finding them exhausted but in good health in the cavite, sent the information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers at the 13th Battalion of the Alpine Hunters of Chambéry were found "pulled but not injured".
They lost themselves in the network, returned to their step by waiting for relief, specified the prefecture.
In fact, they should come out of the cabin with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German Journalists' Union invited its adherents to stop using Google and Yahoo online services on Thursday following new revelations on the activities of the United States and British information services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends journalists to avoid up to a new order to use Google and Yahoo search engines and messages," she said in a communiqué.
It considers the information of Washington Post as scandalous, according to which the National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) collected mass of information by infiltrating the international networks that allow both firms to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the coordinates of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union who claims 38,000 supporters.
Repeatedly: a Member asks for the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
The project by Minister Brigitte Grouwels of "reliefing" of the signal lights in Brussels does not please everyone.
For the record, the Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday at the centre of Brussels a test project consisting of reopening 16 light tubes of the region's yellow and blue colours.
The aim is to "enhance security" and "bruxelles identity".
Finally, the idea is to repeat all Brussels signal lights for an estimated cost of about EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels Member Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of "flaming" the capital and demands the "demission" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"It is not good to spend entirely the money of the Brusselsans in lifting the signaling poles to the colors of the Brussels region, Brigitte Grouwels continues his flashing operations of the Capital," said Mr. De Bock in a communiqué.
After her black-and-black taxis, she finally repeated herself in dark-blue yellow-and-black the Brussels potions.
According to the honourable Member, there is now no "more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brusselsers deserve better than seeing their money spent by a CD&V minister who carries out the NVA program itself.
It's a long time to stop Troie's horse from Flanders.
"To remember, Brigitte Grouwels was only elected by 2 245 votes to 0.5% of the Brussels people!", concludes Mr De Bock.
the Portique de Pont-de-Bus removed
The Portique Ecotaxe de Pont-de-Buis, which took place on Saturday a violent demonstration of opponents to this tax, was dismantled on Thursday morning.
Grapes arrived on the ground shortly after 10 hours, and the circulation on the national was diverted into the crowd.
The decision of the decommissioning, announced by the prefecture of the Finistère Wednesday, was taken by Ecomouv, port manager.
This is the last of the three ecotax ports in the department of Finistère, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launching a accessories store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple Google Glass accessories, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google's connected lenses.
They can thus acquire an earphone, a charger, or even a set-up tube.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers a few accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a micro-fibre protective housing or an intra-auricular earpiece.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction glass, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago, my father disappeared from the world of the living.
At the beginning of his death, I was talking about him now,
I was so afraid to forget it, or rather I didn't know how I was going to continue to "frequent."
There is no recipe, no way of employment to pass the wall of the invisible and find its own.
Then there were signs.
The first time this was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a mild wake full of night to watch his watch that doesn't leave me, placed on the table of night.
It's the image of my smiling father who's accompanying me in my everyday gestures.
Our mother left us after her fight against cancer.
That's at least what I thought the day I found her empty body, spattered on this hospital bed at the cold drawers.
Similarly, his funerals were a glacial adieu focused around the blind light of the candles that would fall into his circle.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little day or night appearances, a little shy, a little confused, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving in the fur and as she took her place in the landscape of my thought that she believed in mourning.
And then she revealed herself to me by revealing my own faces that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost the person of my mother but simply a woman I did not really know, a woman who incarnates that person during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her full and complete.
This distance from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "to the bottom as outside" he seems.
I've always been told.
I never believed him at the time.
I've had difficult relationships with him until he's old, sick.
There, I wasn't afraid of him anymore, and I could love him.
One day, he's dead.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was sick...
He talked to me, he encouraged me all the time, he lived my body.
I saw his hands looking at my men, and I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me alone.
It took a long time then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be included, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I constantly feel them close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence, because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought?
I keep dreaming about them, maybe not all night, but several times a week it's certain.
I often dream of the last moments I have to share with them before it's too late, only there's always something that keeps me from fulfilling this moment.
I often get anxious when it happens to me and I feel deeply about their absence.
Sometimes some dreams lead me to the contrary and to my history and actually, they continue to live and share my life.
The night of my ultrasound where I had to know my baby's sex, I dreamed I would wake up, I would get out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the floor and he would stare at me, and I was glad to wait for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he shared with joy what had happened to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I loved sharing this moment with him and I'm happy to tell you this shared memory that lived after his death.
Just five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That's to say, the shock that his disappearance caused me to be at the time at the bachelor's house.
I've done everything I've done pretty quickly.
But she continues to influence my life, especially when I find myself in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested in the Middle East, at the point of making a master in a large school, was not, with the decline, anodinous choices.
In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has instilled in me are always present, so I can think about how she would like me to act at a given time.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to be at the height of generosity and the rightness of the spirit of the one who was a devout believer.
Now, I feel like a daily presence, a kind soul, a saving spirit.
I see her eyes looking at me.
My mother died ten years ago now.
She died after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all phases: misunderstandings, anger, pain, tears that start alone, no matter where, in unusual places, unusual moments.
Then the time has end.
It was only the lack, the inadvertent void, the need for it, to trust me, to reassure me of the cross of its mildness.
Yet, she's here, silent presence, she's here and she's looking at me.
Every morning, I see her eyes worried to sit on me, I see the candles that brighten her eyes, the lips that grow cigarettes, the most that mark the front of the days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and mother of three children died of a 43-year-old cancer.
We always feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we had little to say to smile, and to pronounce his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I'm talking to her in the middle of the night when the absence is too bad, she's invited into my dreams when morals are a little caught up.
We feel worn out and protected in difficult times, the decline of time makes us realize how much she was the head of the orchestra and we try to stay in the way she had led us.
If a person has loved you very much, the absence can not take you away from your heart and memories.
In a way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 from an asbestos cancer suite.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I couldn't attend his inhumation, and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I sometimes have different beliefs than hers, I still wonder if my actions are consistent with her vision of things.
I have also had problems in my work for these beliefs.
For me, it's impossible to go in a different direction, I don't sleep and I always wonder what he's going to think of it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is that genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, it's here every day.
I feel his presence, and that makes me happy.
I was about thirty years old when my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 and our son was 6 years old.
The huge pain that then invaded me certainly slowed down, but it's always close to me.
Very often he "departs" in my dreams in such a precise way, so vivid that in the wake I am even more sad to find that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was going well, I said no, he answered me "I'm going down" but with a voice so real that I woke up in the air, anxious and I lit the headlight looking everywhere, convinced he was coming.
I always live in the same house, and often, I feel watched and I come back to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In all parts I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we were happy and or his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since I left, it is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am associated with a responsible profession, I laugh and I sing, I go out, I am my grandmother, I am full of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him, and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October has been the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the month of the most murder in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad published official figures this Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This publication shall take place on the day on which the Prime Minister of Iraq received it from the President of the United States.
Nouri al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We do not tell the world to be on our side and to support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," said Al-Maliki this Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not regulated, it will extend, and what is happening in Syria will extend as well.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? It spreads.
Nouri al-Maliki spoke at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They were branding him as a murderer, among other things, and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a police investigation drug sponsor was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed to the public.
He was sentenced to three years imprisonment by the Liverpool Court of Justice
A major defence lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of an important police investigation because he feared that his secret addiction to drugs would not be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave sensitive information to the crime master Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug-related activities after being compromised because of his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was named "Bash" and considered by the criminals as a "first-rate case", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police hearings directed to Scarborough, which he had represented during a previous drug trafficking case.
Police officers reported Sarborough, 32 years old, depositing three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, in Lancashire, while he attended a dinner at the Bar with nurses.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her portfolio and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he sought unlawfully information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by the police in an important investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for £1.5 million, as well as more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to the criminals, for he feared that his drug addiction would not be revealed to the great day.
Today, at Liverpool's trial court, Ditta, who works in the Forbes Seeker's office in Blackburn, has been indiscriminate after being found guilty of two charges against justice after a trial of three weeks.
He had accepted the possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The drop of the lawyer occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, found that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and noticed him coming to Detta's home and placing the drugs, which was 60 per cent, under the lawyer's cupboards in a black golf course.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in contact with Ditta, who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, the club of the Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drug and called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this Class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but refused to consume cocaine. He stated that he had spoken to the drug dealer suspected because it was his client and claimed that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and a sample of hair was taken.
In an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his place of work, and that customers would appeal to him for legal matters.
But the court heard evidence that he called major actors in the drug trade, some of which he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were in the news.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know that the law is not to be violated, he is a criminalist lawyer."
Mr. Ditta was accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with particular clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the normal limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He interrupted the police investigation to the extent possible to enable him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored him.
He got too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and he let himself be compromised by his independence.
Ditta refused any illegal action and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 3 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police stated: "Mr. Ditta has been a criminal lawyer himself since he began to seek drugs from criminal organizations."
Its addiction to cocaine has never compromised it and has made it vulnerable to the back-thinking of members of the leaders of organized criminal groups who have entrusted it with valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of trust with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to cover up his profession's paint.
The Lancashire serious and organized crime unit has conducted an investigation into Mr. Ditta, who has been found guilty of the three leaders of the charge of possession of cocaine and is now in the process of infringing justice, bearing witness to his commitment to prosecute the criminals.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals to know that no one is above the law.
We'll find you and bring you to the courts.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after claiming guilty of complicity in heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a question/response session on herself during which he said his dream job would be a lawyer to represent clients in the death row in America, his last invitation to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and the inequality would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will be on stage in December
The Detroit News reports that the soul queen will take place on December 21 at the Sound Board room at the Hotel MotorCity Casino.
Ms. Franklin is about recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music in November, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she suffered, the famous respected interpreter had said to the media on October 16 that the secondary effects of a treatment she received were "hard".
She claims to be "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lights
420 motifs, 2,2 kilometres of seashore covered with a light coat: the heat cut in Menton could be broken with the lighting bill.
A invoice that, contrary to many commons, is also regulated by taxpayers, not by associations of traders.
To alleviate its costs, the city has used aids.
But also a different management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport evacuated after a shooting
A shooting took place at the Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened the fire.
According to local police, there would have been at least 2 injuries.
This would be an employee for the United States Transport Safety Administration (TSA) and the author of the firefights.
The incident would have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a panic wave.
Travelers and staff flocked to the exits or on the tarmac.
The police were involved very quickly and a man suspected of being the shooter was caught on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is being stopped.
From classical song for adolescents
Every time, it is the school client who will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five satinettes imagined and interpreted by artists in the region, vineyards with a high dose of humor, adolescents are allowed to aprivilege the classical song.
In addition to this show, the lyrical Art Society of the Kingdom will return with its lyrical Destinations, a formula that now completes the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will take place in summer 2014, giving artists in the region a chance to show what they are capable of.
The lyrical Apero, the beneficial concert held last August, has been added to these activities, with the soprano coloration Marie-Éve Munger competition.
It was a beneficial activity, parallel to the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization to produce a financial balance that is as soft to the ears as a windshield air.
Without providing specific figures, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi, to prove himself reassuring.
Despite the concern that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is well drawn, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more constant support.
"The finances are fleeting and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the opera, a step we will take in seven years," the administrator commented.
"I would say even more," added the Director General, Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at the Gabrielle Roy school in Surrey faces six accused heads, according to the Royal Canadian Gendarmerie.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was accused of taking hostage, kidnapping, threatening, carrying weapons in a dangerous design, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to disarm the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Packaget via communication.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New application for collective appeal against the Saint-Croix brothers
A new application for collective appeal was filed against the Saint-Croix brothers regarding sexual assaults that would take place this time in the Oratorium of Saint-Joseph and in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The application is based on the applicant's testimony, identified as "J.J.", which would have been masturbated in the 1950s, first at Our Lady-des-Neiges by his teacher the brother Sumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Oratory of Saint Joseph, where he was serving as a minister and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was aimed only at three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people said to us, "I was in such a place, can I sign up?", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends victims in both appeals.
The collective appeal that has just been filed has particular implications for the addition of complainants to any institution where abuses could have been carried out by members of the Saint-Croix Congregation.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been attacked by the Saint-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, as several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also emphasizes that the Congregation of Saint-Croix and the Oratory of Saint-Joseph, which is a distinct entity, "have allowed sexual abuses to be committed against children", that they "have exercised a moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims", that they "were aware of the sexual abuses committed and have nevertheless been stifled", and that they "have deliberately and deliberately chosen to ignore the problem".
These last accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by Saint-Croix's lawyer, Me Emile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also by research done in the archives in this regard by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former Saint-Croix's brother who publicly denounced the abuses.
The collective appeal must first pass the stage of admissibility in the Supreme Court.
Once the admissibility accepted by the Court is taken at the second stage, the hearings on the ground are held.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Saint-Croix had agreed to settle with the friendly before hearings were held on the ground.
Importance of fire in a trade
A fire seriously damaged a trade in LaSale, Montréal, on Thursday night to Friday.
The reliefs were called at 1:00 a.m. on Friday, because of a fire that had been reported to the basement of an Indian kitchen restaurant on the Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
Thirty firefighters who were sent to the places spent about an hour controlling the brewery.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building", said the Chief of Operations of the Fire Safety Service in Montreal, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firemen arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but almost twenty dwellings, located on the first and second floors of this commercial area, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments might have to be temporarily housed, the SIM indicated.
Many opposition to medical aid to death at the Congress of Palliative Care
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, which takes place this week in Ottawa, occurs a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the Bill on Medical Assistance to Die in Quebec.
It is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to relieve their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their days, according to a spokesman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the focus was on palliative care in Canada, the Euthanasia approach would be minimal.
The President of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical assistance to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences of the next generation.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
Most palliative care houses will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Palliative Care Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless in any way.
We are never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Québec Bill disorients the population regarding the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario's gonna make it.
On the other hand, the Liberal Member of Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, said that the concept of the end of life should be clarified before the bill was passed.
Kenya's press demands the controversial media law
"It is a defraying country and it is legitimate to ask the following question: what will prevent Parliament from flouting the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" the newspaper stated, contesting the bill and asking for it to be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Director General of Capital Group, owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and Internet sites in Kenya.
He said that the new media court "will always be partial because it is a extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the world economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to the parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have "the media handle." The Standard, as for him, indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya had "suddenly suffered" and festered the bill as a "draconian".
The adoption of the bill takes place at the same time as a train of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the siege carried out by armed Islamists in the Westgate mall last September.
The kenyens media provoked the anger of the authorities by spreading images of video surveillance cameras on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack were devolving the commercial centre of luxury.
The chief of police, David Kimaiyo, responded by summoning two journalists and a media officer to interrogate them, although the summons was withdrawn from the media as a result of an increase in loopholes.
Under the new bill, the media will be able to pass amendments up to 20 million shillings kenys and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "radiated" or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if he has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations".
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "animated blogosphere".
By reducing the media to silence, political men know that they can do what they want without impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing the media knowys as a key source of control in public life.
"In books themselves, political men would defeat the country and bring us back to hunting and shooting."
The Kenyan legislators were the target of the anger of the people in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission on Wages and restored their Mirobollant Wages of approximately 532,000 shillings per month exempt from tax – which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists to the Health and Social Services Centre (CSSS) in Laval has caused a great deal of excitement at the direction of the City-de-la-Santé Hospital, which was in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirement leave, maternity leave or short leave, the pharmaceutical department was very poor in staff.
Nearly 30% of the necessary personnel were missing, making this financial year very difficult, according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS decided not to engage in independent work, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
There was no use for detention, Mrs. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities within the institution have been rationalized or reduced, while things are being replaced.
Of course, we have worked hard to interest our young [pharmacians] so that they come and stay here.
There is a competition of circumstances that caused us to be in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this severe period, the year 2013-2014 is much easier for the Department of Pharmacy of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists have returned to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in the last few months.
In addition, the Department's efforts to retain fruit have been successful, as the four students are currently resident in Laval also decided to remain in the use of the CSS.
Now, it's going a lot better, he stressed the pharmacy.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
So this will end our departures from last year.
ever-increasing health
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or a predominance of young women in the field, make situations such as her life in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of employees] is always careful, because we have a young environment and many young women are employed, so with pregnant women, we are almost always on three maternity leave when it's right, she added.
In the last year, there have been many more and there are no pharmacists available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The top 22-year-old model doesn't start his career in cinema by the small door.
The director Lars von Trier chose him to incarnate Charlotte Gainsburg young in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This violent pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will come out in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), is the erotic memories of an adult quadrant.
Stacy Martin's likeness with his grandfather is striking: a silhouette of brandy, a diaphane tent and Franco-English origins.
Without forgetting a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to put nude on the ice paper will appear in much more sulphurizing situations on the large screen.
An extract from Nymphomaniac caused the temperature to rise on the Table: Stacy Martin appeared there in bed and with a full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker has asked his actors to put their power in the poster, he has used X professionals for the most ossetian sex scenes before mixing all the bodies numerically: above the belt, it is the star; below, the double.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, passing by Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is used to pushing his actors into their last retreats, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A room of the Narbonne CGR evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday night, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR of Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, following bites to the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the head of the facility conducted the evacuation of the room and prevented the fires for a suspicious smell.
About 70 people were released from the meeting.
People have been examined and full recognition of the room has not been given.
Bad pleasure on the bottom of the lacrimogen jet?
Or an involuntary incident?
Still, the film management has played the precautionary principle and the security of its clients in the background.
The room was aired and everything was back in order.
The film has been able to resume its rights and customers find the pleasure of images.
On screen only.
It tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into lemons
Taking advantage of Halloween day, a woman tried to get two kilos of cocaine dissipated into the country in lemons, Thursday morning, at the airport Montréal-Trudeau.
It was during the passenger baggage examination that the drug was detected.
The cocaine had been distributed into three citrocles that had been previously emptied.
The drug was then transported to the Office of the Royal Canadian Gendarmerie (GRC) who took the lead in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (ASFC) did not reveal where the woman was coming from when she was intercepted.
It is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, CBSA spokesperson.
What I can tell you is that she arrived in the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border officials at the airport of Montréal-Trudeau have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border officials in the Quebec region carried out a total of 1653 drug arrests.
Air raid against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli planes entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday in the early afternoon, but hits took place in the evening.
A short-range SA-8 short-air missile load would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new raid of Tsahal's aviation in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances close to the one that had taken place on July 5th: at that time it was also an anonymous U.S. official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, aiming at this time at the suicide missiles of Yakhont, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials did not hide their irritation to see Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy
The Standard & Poor's rating agency reduced Ukraine's solvency note on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet Republic to meet its financial obligations for more than a year.
The country's public debt note goes to "B-", focusing on the category of speculative investments.
It has a negative perspective, S&P seeing at least one chance of three that it is once again down by one year.
"It is less and less likely that the government strategy will ensure sufficient foreign currency to meet its high external funding needs," the US agency explains.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This complicates the reimbursement of foreign loans.
These reserves, to which the authorities have made massive use of to support local currency, hryvnia, as the agency finds itself to be more and more likely to judge an evaluation, which would inflame its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which charges it not to have paid an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for the Ukrainian power in a period of live tensions with its Russian neighbour, angry with Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public on the following day of the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had undergone its fifth quarter between July and September following the contract.
Its slowdown, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimated it to be 33.5% of GDP, compared with less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in a budget deficit, has been calling for the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, which had granted it $15.3 billion in 2010 and has now only $3.4 billion.
However, the Fund refuses to pay any new instalment until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
As a result of a new unproductive mission in the country, the IMF found this week that "the important needs for external financing" constituted "vulnerability", as well as "significance of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "a short-term improvement cannot be expected".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," Presidential elections are scheduled in 2015, the expert replied to the AFP.
The only hope is to improve the international economy.
S&P also reflects the "insecurity" associated with the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditionals on the release of opposition Ioulia Timochenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade, but there could be negative consequences in short and medium-term terms related to Russia's reaction," said S&P, who feared the "commercial restrictions" on Moscow.
Russia, which represents the fourth of Ukrainian exports, has predicted that in the event of the creation of a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls on imported goods.
Green light from the United States at the Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday that they had received no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus drawing closer to the creation of the first world advertising agency.
The merger actually approaches the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the review period of the merger previously announced by Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended", announces both groups in a communiqué.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the SSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in other jurisdictions will meet many of the conditions required for carrying out the operation.
"The merger is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory authorizations and approval of shareholders of the two groups," they add.
The Congolese Army seeks the rebels of the M23
The Congolese Army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units were going to prosecute the rebels of the M23 to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu border of Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears on the point of being beaten after being expelled from the villages of the north-east Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that he had been in control since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurrection.
"We are going to pursue the M23 and take it wherever it is hiding because it is criminals," Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesperson for the FARDC, told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to restore peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure, and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military appeals would not alter his claims to peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, took place in Kampala on Wednesday between the Kinshasa government and M23.
Aggregates are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last locality insurgents to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion was seen today in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the head of the province of North Kivu, benefiting from the escape from the government garrison and the passivity of the blue helmets of Monosco.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission to RDC, the world's most important in terms of personnel, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade consisting of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
On the other hand, the FARDC's major state of affairs has been remanded and the army has turned to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of war.
The pace of progress of government troops is unprecedented today.
"The M23 seems to touch its end," said a Congolese business expert, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historical - it would be the first time Kinshasa’s government managed to defeat a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group associated with Rwanda would be present in the east of the DRC.
United Nations experts have accused Rwanda, which denies it far-reachingly, of military support for the M23, consisting of the departure of mutiny Congolese military elders.
The head of the British diplomacy, William Hague, invited the Rwandan President Paul Kagame to prove detention, announced a spokesman for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali had referred to the possibility of military reprisals as a result of shells falling within Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the people of Bunagana invaded the streets of Burgade to greet the entry of FARDC soldiers.
"We lived a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to us to be released by the army," one of Uganda's inhabitants testifies.
"We lived in terror (M23), we were traumatized," he added.
The tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected by the coronavirus have turned out to be negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 therefore remain the only two cases confirmed in France to date."
Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient had been suspected of being reached, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease had already killed fifty people.
Chevron, the second US oil company, reported a decline in its quarterly profit due to the decrease in its refinery margins, while its production of oil and gas increased while still lagging behind in relation to the group's objectives.
Its net profit for the third quarter has decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per action, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per action, a year ago.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters averaged $2.71 in profit.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, rising from 2.52 million bpj produced one year earlier.
The company aims at 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a 25% increase in production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
As a result of the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures increased by $7 billion in two years and should amount to $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities have decreased slightly in the third quarter, while the profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) have dropped from 45 per cent to $380 million.
This drop in refining margins affects the whole sector.
Thus Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil made a statement on Thursday of a net down profit, despite the increase in its production of gas and oil.
School transport: the complaint deemed admissible
The Sherbrooke Regional School Commission (CSRS) has been demanding from the beginning of the school year the cost of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students receiving school transport at two residences, a service offered by the organization when it is able to do so.
Before the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was requested.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the committee and I was interested," explains Mrs. Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediation and requested additional time to reflect on it.
"It's always better to talk about it, work together and find solutions," says Mrs. Lefèvre.
The School Committee of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not want to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation was part of the process during a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the Urgency of the Hotel-Gode
Faced with a number of months of staff and several trade unions, including CGT, the Minister of Health Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "cut down the project implementation schedule, and in particular the date of closure of emergencies that cannot occur on 4 November".
An official request was made "to avoid any risk of taking care of the emergencies in Paris at the beginning of winter" but was also intended not to damage the PS campaign within a few months of the municipalities.
In spite of the ministerial mandates, the closure should still be effective at that date.
Even though the APHP prefers to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of 4 November, firefighters who would provide about one quarter of the 40,000 annual crossings at the Hotel-God emergency will have all received to bring the thirty serious cases per day to the emergency of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of boarding facilities.
At the Hotel-Gode, interns in emergency will leave place on Monday to five interns in general medicine.
As for the transfer of internal medical beds, it is programmed for the current month.
"The hotel-God emergency reception service must be closed as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4th," says Loïc Capron, president of the APHP Medical Commission (CME), who supports the draft direction.
"On 4 November, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," says Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new Hotel-God.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in an emergency," he said, explaining the permanent presence of vehicles of the SMUR on-site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain in place, also ensure.
But it is for the ARS to decide on the closure of the emergency reception service.
"The things are happening progressively," says Nicolas Péju, spokesperson of the ARS for whom, on 4 November, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or we lied to him," laments urgent doctor Gerald Kierzek.
Released from its position as head of the SMUR in early July to have led the front against the reorganization project, it is defined as a "warner" in relation to a "cynic" decision made by "the medical-administrative technology".
"They're emptying and asphyxiating the emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago," he says.
For him, "if the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
But they're getting pregnant on a regular basis.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for Lariboisière's emergencies.
At the ARS, it is argued that thirty "disposed" patients on several sites are not at risk of being a "valanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources will also be strengthened.
In the ARS as in the APHP, the "new hospital model" has been on the way since 7 October and should continue to welcome 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal generalist physicians should also participate in the establishment of an "permanence of outpatient care".
"Where are we going if people are asked to self-diagnose," asks Gerald Kierzek, for whom "the concept of no serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This will happen as for grade 3 maternity.
People aren't mad, they're going where there's the best supply of care.
If the minister does not take measures by Monday, we will change our braquet, Christophe Prudhomme, an urgent physician and a member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Koscisko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, a Paris UMP advisor and elected to the 4th roundabout, clearly announces that "even though the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of the emergency at the Hotel-God, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to the responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, once again recalled Monday morning on France Inter that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there was no closure on November 4th.
If that were the case, she would mark her net disagreement, says Bruno Julliard, her spokesman.
Even though the restructuring of the Hotel-God has its legitimacy on the ground, we cannot accept it without an acceptable schedule of postponement to other hospitals.
Obama ends hearings aimed at the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to terminate its hearings on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its information activities, a United States official said Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to resume its hand in the matter of NSA's hearings after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time the supervision of the IMF and the World Bank has been mentioned by the information agency since the start of the scandal.
Questioned on this issue, a U.S. government official replied: "The United States does not carry out electronic surveillance aimed at the headquarters of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington."
Expressing itself under the seal of the anonymity, the person responsible did not specify whether such supervision had been established in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had ordered that these practices be discontinued over the past weeks.
This instruction was given at almost the same time as that at the end of the United Nations headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Information Commission approved a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programmes on Thursday, but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on the data that information agencies are authorized to collect and has imposed a five-year limit on the retention of such information.
The United Nations welcomes the new goals for combating poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been established 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in the development of the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that it was now time to "exceed national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and adapt to the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he added.
These ODAs will build on the progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals based on the success of the MDGs.
Security-related concerns in Mozambique grow at the same time as conflicts erupt among powerful personalities
At the feet of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder president of Mozambique, while tossing them, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace to come back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, director-general of an investment company.
Concerned about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes against a tea-shirt with the word "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowded crowd in the place of the Independence of Thursday capital.
For two weeks, there have been almost every day of reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst violations since the peace agreement signed over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, supported at the outset by the white Rhodésia and then the South African apartheid government in efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not fall into open conflict, but recent events have swept away foreign investors and the local population.
The issue is considerable for the economy in full growth, as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and carbon deposits in the north-west could attract more than $50 billion of investments in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale du Brazil, Eni d'Italia and Anadarko of the United States.
Frelimo, the power party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo reject each other's responsibility for tensions.
Renamo states that the government is at the origin of recent confrontations and that it launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional base of Renamo on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels then degenerate when the government forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman for the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for triggering the conflict, and the charge of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize the concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza said on Wednesday to the AFP, the French press agency, that Mr. Dhlakama was considered a "lost" who wanted to use "all the forces left to him to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government".
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said that Renamo had abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness," said Mr Mazanga.
The previous discussions between the parties failed to alleviate the tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
"These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who don't stop arguing," explained Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the open and specialist university in Mozambique.
None of them know how to negotiate and none of them are ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that she would boycott municipal elections before it took place in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled next year.
Some commentators interpreted its use of force as an attempt to obtain concessions and a war treasure on the part of the government.
The share of the supplies collected by the Renamo continues to decline since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, should obtain a greater number of supplies to the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who should retire at the end of his second term of office next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," Mr Mazanga said.
We do not know exactly what Renamo's capacity is, but it has carried out clear disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south motorway axis.
Most of the anchorages took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio could no longer use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when he was asked if Renamo would repeat that threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has strengthened the frustrations of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think that the country's future leaders are the government and the president, and that it is for the country to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protestor, said that people only wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to the roads," he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as "life-style models," says the author.
The Thor's Legend could show that "the brutal force does not make the weight against subtle Russians", while the Argentine legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "very violent, too scandalous and in some cases too obscenous to be taught at school", Crossley-Holland recommended a "minute selection" of works adapted to age.
"I find it amazing that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I've been complaining about this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are “openly educational” makes children“ completely decoy, ” the messages being “sublime” in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an adult author who writes for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or ended well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And he must be subdued; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The basis is known for what we show and that we don't say it.
One of Hamas' army fighters was killed this night and another wounded by an Israeli car shot in the Gaza Strip, learned from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists carried out a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they shot an Israeli blind.
NSA espionage: the United States is "going too far", admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in the matter of espionage, he acknowledged the Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first decade of Washington in controversy with Europe on the massive data collection by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and slander between the United States and their European allies, it is the first time that an American government official explicitly accepts the practices disputed in the understanding of communications and data by NSA in Europe.
"In some cases, I congratulate you, as the president has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this is no longer happening in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London that he has been participating since Thursday, October 31, through video link.
In his retransmission, in the presence of British counterpart William Hague, the head of the U.S. diplomacy has long justified information and information-collection practices through the necessary counter-terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry assured the US authorities that many attacks had been launched, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have actually prevented airplanes from falling, buildings from exploding and people being killed, because we were able to be aware of these projects," the US diplomat argued.
And John Kerry said to the address of Europeans, "I assure you that innocent people have not been misled in this process."
But we are trying to collect information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate way," admitted the Secretary of State, who had already expressed himself on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday night that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and that he was conducting a review of these practices so that no one would feel wrong".
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued to rage this week with new revelations in the press.
According to Washington Post, the NSA intercepted hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The journal, which cites documents obtained from the former consultant of the NSA Edward Snowden, states that the program "MUSCULAR", and conducted with the British counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from the optical fibers used by Internet giants.
It is believed that one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected during the only month of January - from metadata on e-mails, text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would have taken place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA would have intercepted data and communications from allies of the United States and their leaders, including the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
In the face of the wrath of the European States and when leaks in the American press claimed that the US President was not aware of such rumors, Barack Obama refused to express himself on this matter, calling for national security.
On the other hand, the master of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, accused him of having taken over tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even sent the ball back to European intelligence services that would be seized of these communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would be "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and that would not be the case for Europe at all, said General Alexander.
And the controversy extended to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has convened the Ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by Americans as part of a vast international spying network that has also caused China's rage.
The Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without his master's duty, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the League 1 club in a communiqué.
The PSG, leader of the championship in front of Monaco with the difference of goals, has published the list of players held for this 12th day match, without including the 32-year-old attack.
The communiqué simply indicates that it is "damaged", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered a left knee inflammation at the time of his re-election, at the beginning of months.
A ceremony in memory of the cremated dead
At 11 a.m., Father Lachase's crematorium organizes a lay ceremony, in memory of all the deaths cremated in his institution during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate in Paris, will attend and then explain his funeral proposals at a press conference.
To follow the ceremony, click on it.
For their own obese, more and more French choose cremation, rather than inhumation: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6 and 7, with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For a neighbor's obsessions, this is the opposite: the French prefer inhumation (53% versus 47%).
If they have the trouble of losing a child, they're only 15% to choose the cremation.
In his book La Mort en ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Funeral Ethics Committee, stresses the "violence" that constitutes cremation for survivors.
There is, with the cremation, "a violence committed to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a heap of ashes" in very little time, and not after a decomposition process, which "would accompany the phases of grief".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which holds to the "escapement of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymate" of the ashes.
Why is what is accepted without penalty in some Nordic and Protestant countries still poorly lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," answers Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Heatology and author of the book Approve death.
It has only been tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to adjudicate it.
To welcome the cremation, it is for François Michaud-Nérard, Director General of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to arrange for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as the one to which he would be entitled with an inhumation.
The annual survey of Ipsos shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their neighbors, whether it is religious (53%) or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen a cremation wish to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For ten years, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately following the resuscitation of the ashes," observed Mr. Michaud-Nérard.
70 per cent of the institutions are now proposing ceremonies, which are taking place in the presence of the body at the following ritual: welcoming the assembly, appointing the deceased, connecting the others, bringing it out, making sense of its death, organizing the adjournment.
This is the case at the crematorium of Father Lachase, since 1998.
The ceremony masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
In this context, since 2010, La Toussaint's day, the crematorium of Father Lachase has organized several commemorative, secular and non-religious ceremonies, to which he invites the families of the people who have been cremated in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is retransmitted in line with those who could not move.
The crematorium allowed us to relax.
A La Seyne, the relogation for rats turns to controversy
At the beginning of the week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructador D2 building because of the presence of rats.
In view of the urgency of the situation, the director of the South Habitat Land Office proposed, in an exceptional and provisional manner, to relog the couple and their three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken excessive proportions, according to Joël Canapa, the director of the office.
Rats, there's always been in the cities.
The detachment company carries out two transitions a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our own expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
We have thus made 64 interventions since the end of the last winter.
The neighborhood is not left to abandon, and rats do not puke in the city.
For reasons of protection of the environment and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, certainly, but for two rats, a goose will not be killed.
"We didn't invite rats at our house," defends the family father who left his home to stay at the hotel.
We are soon without the bread and we expect a new home, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange is down by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The quota paid back the dollar against the yen, harmful to export values and warning of its annual result launched by Sony Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and the Topix increased 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.33.
Sony dropped from more than 11% to 1 668 yens.
A house for the flame in the Old Quebec
A fire that broke out on Friday afternoon in the Old Quebec was quickly controlled.
More than thirty firemen were sent to the 9th of Hebert Street.
Flames were declared in a three-storey house on four floors behind the Québec seminary.
All the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the arrival of the firemen, who were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firemen arrived, they really saw the apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms happened, because it took the strength to attack the building, because there are buildings trapped here," explained France Loiselle, spokesperson for the firefighters in Quebec.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the actor of vaudeville Frank Fay, who held the role of ceremony master at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell lies directly to the audience, on the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it has been resumed more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolina stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of the posters emerged in Carolina, and they were very successful, until they became too famous to play in a club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comedy and music evening for the benefit of former combatants, organized at Madison Square Garden, where they will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has taken its place as well as the world of comedy.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival have been passed through non-traditional circuits, presenting, for example, small television shows such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a cabled chain ("The League") on the theme of fantasy football cheerfully lascife of the FXX chain and now has his own show of sketches on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the "Saturday Night Live" show and was part of the "parks and Recreation" cast, but she is still more known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians to the single voice (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of the racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products from the decentralized world of the American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but he became a film and television director, as well as an official comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he launched a TV show Land called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting is held at the Hotel de Ville, in the centre of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comic DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that, when he was here, sometimes he went down a street between two buildings and said, "Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come live here."
The oil price continues to decline and closes to $96 the barrel
The oil price continued to decline on Friday, while the concerns about the importance of stocks account for a report showing that the GORM manufacturing sector is strengthening itself.
The US gross delivery reference price in December dropped from $14 cent to $96.24 at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a drop of 5.8% for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price over the last few weeks.
The US Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which showed a growth in activity, suggested an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to recover after growth has increased to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decrease that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter.
The gross Brent, a reference to the international gross already used by the American refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 the barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Withdrawal of the right to abortion in Texas
A federal appeal court restored to Texas some restrictions on the right of voluntary abortion that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that State and that the right to abortion is largely challenged will enter into force.
The judgment given by the appeal court means that doctors who will practice IVG should have a "admission privilege" with local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, under his or her membership status, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to deliver a diagnosis or treatment.
IVG advocates argue that the content of the law is likely to result in an immediate closure of a third of the state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, it would be nearly 22,000 women who would be deprived of access to these institutions.
On Monday, a court judge had held that the provisions dealing with the right of admission were anti-constitutional at the time of the entry into force of the law.
But the Attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is in charge of the Governor's position, asked the court to cancel the trial of first instance that blocked the application of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has managed to return to force, alongside hearings, with 1.3 million TV viewers behind their TV station, 5.6% on the part of the audience.
But was the show on your date?
Some 10,000 candidates came to the hearings of this 10th season, to confront the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, the Persian André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really marked at this first prize.
Like every year, the first auditions create a wide selection of grass singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
But on Twitter, we want the show, the emotion, the originality, the music...
Fortunately, a few found their account.
They are many to have tried the New Star, and sometimes even to be gone to the end.
Behind television screens, successful singer vocations are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to laugh.
The court blocks a decision on NYPD's control and search policy
A federal appeal court blocked a judge's decision calling for changes in the New York Police Department's control and search program and dismissed the case.
The United States Appeal Court (second circuit) indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the outcome of the appeal by the city.
The judge had decided in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to monitor and question citizens.
The city appealed to its conclusions and correctional orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in modifying its policy and training program associated with it.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the application for suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be dismissed from the case because it violated the judge's code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of partiality, in part because of a series of interviews with the media and public statements in which it responded publicly to the criticisms of the court.
The judge had found that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men in their control and search program.
It has designated an external controller to monitor changes, including policy reform, training and oversight, and has ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras on the body in areas where the largest number of controls are taking place.
In August, New York City agreed to put an end to the practice of preserving the names and addresses of the persons whose case is rejected after a police check.
The hearing of the appeal by the city should take place after 14 March 2014.
Many civil rights defenders have criticised the tactics of control and investigation.
This control and search system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of registered controls has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls, mainly concerning black men and Hispanic origin.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
Participants promoting changes in the NYPD's monitoring and investigation program say that they will end wrong practices, allow more effective police forces to be trusted, and will be able to change the way police departments use policy.
The opponents say that these changes would undermine police morale without reducing crime, represent a waste of money and do not solve the wider problem of pressured police forces after police officers have been severely reduced in the past decade.
The judge stressed that it did not end the practices of control and investigation, which are constitutional, but that it reformed the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
The tenants have to vote, as each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of the accommodation that goes in taxes in the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each apartment.
We are forced to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
By voting, we send a clear message.
We need to make things change in the City.
All the candidates told us that they would face scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay us artificial lights at $100,000, land of $4 to $5 million for the case where...
Go vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say it's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entered into the 500 m2 of the elysene cuisine as a commission after working in the embassies, the cook took all the steps to become chief, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande by passing through Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation places, and fed an incalculable number of great people in this world in a nearly anonymity that breaks only today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years.
The man with the open face, skull degarni and intellectual glasses, born 24 October 1953 in Ferté-Saint-Aubin, is the holder of a Pastery CAP.
His mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I have passed from one castle to the other!", ironic Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the hands of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also their wives and some of their illustrative guests.
"He's always the head of the state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly into the kitchen," as she had banned women in the kitchens of Elysée!
It does not move to state leaders who displayed relative indifference to land-based food, "they are all gourmets," politely explains Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly more developed appetite."
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed cheese, the seats returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored cheese, "there's someone who likes to eat" and "there's nothing great that he doesn't like".
The current head of the state, who has recovered the lost pounds before the presidential campaign, has no "no specific regime request".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially at the state dinners at Elysée: "between 200 and 250 people must be used in about an hour".
The night before, it's almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there were mistakes.
The former chef of Elysée's kitchens, who took a glass Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, shared with a painting in the heart."François Hollande came to greet me."
He said compliments.
"His human side has risen," he says.
The leader will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who has been for his part for seventeen years at Elysée.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Québec
A historic house built in 1850 was the flame-pig in the Vieux-Québec on Friday afternoon.
The building of four houses, located on the 15th of Hebert Street, has been subjected to three fire alarms.
The fire went ahead, but it rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Québec Fire Protection Service, pointed out that the rapid intervention of firefighters has prevented the spread of fires to adjacent buildings, a size challenge for this sector of the city where the buildings are built in close proximity.
The fire house opened four apartments, but no tenant was on the premises at the time of the fire.
The damage has been limited, even if the water has caused damage.
An investigation will be carried out to determine the origin of it, but the tasters have deviated from the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wall Street Loup: Out of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets out a few images of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is incarcerated by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio is going to disappoint you in his role as a dealer.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "long Island Stock Exchange broker who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in the context of a large corruption case at Wall Street."
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then goes up a nest that will make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow her incredible ascent, but also the vertigo fall that will follow.
Without limits, man robs parties, women, drugs.
Disappointment and overindulgence in all kinds are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seemed to have found the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese took too long due to its installation.
It would seem that the film lasts at 2:45.
In the Chamber on 25 December, he will be able to participate in a fair course in the Oscar race.
Coulson used phone piracy to check a tube
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "telephonic piracy, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a Bidon pipe on a connection involving the Minister of the Interior then in exercise, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC stated before the Court of Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her "beautiful special adviser".
It was reported to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, with hacking Pawlby's voice box and "planting in front of his door," but Coulson also called him and left him with voice messages.
"The charge suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of the people's house while waiting to surprise them, is the kind of man to love to present the story to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He said that NotW used three means to investigate topics: telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Did he know about phone piracy?
He claims otherwise, but we say, “Of course I do. ”
The rumors about a connection involving Clarke were taken first by the NotW editor's office when a source, experiencing a sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, said that she had been told: "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A band, on which voice messages were recorded pirated on its phone at least three times, was arrested at the home of Mulcaire in August 2006.
The investigators also found arrests on the computer of the private detective concerning Ms. Pawlby and her sister listed in a "Projects" file.
During the period of the detective's investigation, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis added.
Meanwhile, former head reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former head reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Ms. Pawlby's minor actions and actions.
In a voice message he left on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about a relationship with a married woman while he himself attended the co-defender Rebecca Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks refused to have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to performing telephone piracy.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister, full of violence
The US President was to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, seeking United States aid to combat the strongest wave of violence for five years.
In October, Iraq experienced its most deadly month in five and a half years, according to figures published on Friday 1 November by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the October violence, 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations provides an even higher balance sheet with 979 deaths and 1,902 injured.
These violence is becoming more and more horrendous despite enhanced security measures and large-scale military operations launched months ago by the government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by the Shiite.
The total number of deaths in October was highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of US troops, the level of violence scares a new kiss while neighboring Syria is in the process of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men were beaten in the streets or even in their homes, and security forces were also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being marginalized politically and being the target of unjust arrests, has promoted this flame of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four persons in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 persons in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Baghdad.
A large part of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (sunist extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
Violence is at the centre of the United States interviews with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the US President, elected on the promise to end the military commitment in that country, had developed an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since its arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive, and the election of Congress.
On Thursday, he appealed for the international community to wage a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by republican and democratic senators.
But the latter also criticised Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, who attributed him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sector and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded from Barack Obama that he make Nouri Al Maliki understand that "the pernicious influence of Iran within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship".
Beijing accuses a Uighur group of the Tiananmen attack
On Friday, the Chinese Home Security Chief accused a group of Xinjiang segurgists of being behind the arresting car that killed five people in the Tiananmen Square in the center of Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, drowned on the crowd that was on the famous seat of the Chinese capital, symbol of the deadly repression carried out in 1989, and took fire at killing its three passengers and two passersby.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Office responsible for internal security issues, accused the Islamic movement of East Turkmenistan of being the instigator of this attack.
Many ears, a Turkish-speaking minority located in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province the eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for frequent outbreaks of violence, which occur in the presence of independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and pre-empted," said Meng at the Hong Kong-Phoenix TV channel.
"The group that was on the march was the Islamic movement of East Turkey," he added, his speech being repeated by the new Chinese agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he was originally oyghour and specified that his wife and mother were in the car with him.
The latter also contained fuel-filled containers and a flag with orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident caused 42 injuries.
The Islamic movement of East Turkey is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican polls on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has begun to carry out a major survey throughout the world on how parishes manage sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce and married couples of the same sex.
The survey asks participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each of the bishops' national conferences, with the aim of getting as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as an important gathering on the family that Pope François plans to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic journal of the United States.
A spokesman for the Conference of the Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide in an appropriate manner to investigate the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published an Internet survey asking Catholics to participate.
RDC: The Army Attacks the Last Feast of the Rebels
The M23's irreducibles, a few hundred combatants, were reduced to nearly 2000 metres above the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two locations about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fights continue despite the night," AFP reported to a resident of Jomba, connected by phone at 12:30 p.m., and according to whom a girl was injured by dance in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased slightly," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have slightly repulsed the rebels."
According to this witness who wished to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "passed the night" in Jomba before going up the front for a "warning operation".
It was very clear that he was being followed by feeding on small arms.
From Bunagana, political fief and the last strong place of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, a journalist of the AFP could hear heavy weapons detonation.
According to a source to the United Nations Mission for the Stabilisation of the DRC, the fights entered "in a final phase", the FARDCs having "closed the residual M23 positions to decompose them".
Since the resumption on Friday, the clashes between the Movement of 23 March (M23) and the army, the Monusco does not participate directly in the fight, but it provides the government troops with decisive support for information, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied in ammunition, mounted in the direction of the front line.
They were armed with kalachnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, borderline with Uganda, soldiers assisted by civilians were carrying a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a new FARDC flaming truck, to ensure that another machine was used to lift the M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila called on the rebels again on Wednesday night to "demobilize themselves voluntarily" without being disarmed "by force", but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December without results for the moment.
On the spot, M23 political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, there is no more than the Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, Vice-President of the M23 delegation, without any confirmation of this information immediately on the government side.
M23 was born of a mutiny, in April 2012, of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M23, which reject Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its sub-soil contains convoted mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where approximately 5,000 people had fled between Monday and Wednesday according to the United Nations, the movement of return to the DRC that had set off in the morning was reversed in the middle of the day.
"This morning we returned to go to our fields, but the soldiers told us to return," told AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including a baby on her back.
It seems that the flames are approaching the population.
At the beginning of the evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this beast of stage
Classics, sophisticated, popular, English or French, sing and dance productions take over.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: the musical in French affirms itself as a sort of success.
Long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart's rock opera, most of the attempts were in the joke.
And success like Cabaret or the Miserables carried the aureol of the mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin in Châtelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the woman.
Today, these two scenes keep titles like successful tubes.
The first one, this Christmas, is excellent My Fair Lady and announces after the world creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "The Beauty and the Beast" could well be one of the success of the season.
On the other scenes, musical shows such as "1789", "Bastil lovers" and small musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are placed in the range of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "History of Musical Comedy" and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard.
How do French musical comedies evolve?
The offer has doubled.
First there are the "musical shows" that evolve at the heart of producers...
Some use beautiful images projections and a real story as in 1789, the Bastille Lovers.
Others make a 15-year-old bond under the pretext that we can serve almost anything when we have Matt Pokora in the head of the poster.
After that, we have musical comedies with the suspicious productions of the Châtelet that bring us back to life the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes English-Saxon musical comedies of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are trying to make a difference.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Baiser of Araigned Women" or "The Awakening of Spring" are bad to be financed.
Do we have enough capable artists like Broadway singing, playing and dancing?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talent artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the berth of musical comedy is very different.
Young people are trained in these fields in many schools.
The jobs are numerous among regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The livery of talent is also the result of the number of positions to be held.
Why do provincial tours have so much success?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor parent of the culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often the theatre of boulevard for adults and not young adults.
Music shows fill this gap.
These are the same young people who like television and what it produces as epheres stars...
Suggesting beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance of an engagement of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are generally held by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a Zenith province.
Mayonnaise is raised in Paris and tasted by the provinces.
The show is designed to enter all the large rooms of France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury, Friday morning at 5:30 p.m., on the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart in the direction of Waterloo.
A driver's car has been hit by a ghost driver, who's being compensated for it.
The ring was closed to the traffic up to 9:00 at the site of the accident, the time when the road is lost and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
This situation, however, did not cause quite confusion as the accident occurred at the height of the Hoeilaart exit.
The circulation could therefore be diverted by this output/entry of the ring.
A child severely injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was severely injured as a result of an accident on an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged, but he is always hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It was closed to a new order.
RDC: Army prepares a new test.
Children are playing on a carbonized armor belonging to the rebels of the M23 in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, in the East of the DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing for a new siege on Friday against the last bases of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in the East of the DRC.
The aim is to disarm the M23 of the hills that surpass Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, which overlaps the hill of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall from herself.
There will be no more than the hill of Runyonyi.
"Cel de Chanzu is not very strategic," the Governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku, told the AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to go to Bunagana on Saturday.
Five political and last strong place of the rebellion, this town is located at the Ugandan border, approximately 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred M23 irreducibles have been reduced to nearly 2,000 metres above the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and nearby Jomba
In Jomba, a resident who had made war on Thursday all day said that the situation was "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the battles of the guard and buried.
One girl was injured by a ball, and three others were injured, including a cry, evacuated by the FARDC, added this witness quoted by the AFP.
Since the resumption of the battles between FARDC and the rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have given no balance to the loss of human life.
NSA's revelations increase the company's paranoia with regard to State surveillance
On a beautiful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew over the British Consulate of Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On behalf of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the National Information Agency of Germany, its mission was to photograph the roof of the US front office, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explained that the BfV expected to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation resulted in an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Capper, director of U.S. intelligence services, once again stressed in September that the United States did not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "flight the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant, became a denouncing consultant, has begun to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information about the secrets of United States surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director in words.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has spyed on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever triggered company paranoia with regard to State surveillance.
The revelation that the German chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that caused the vessel to land.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. information services and businesses transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.
"Germany must wake up," says BITMI President Oliver Grün, who represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the United States is at risk as important as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the EY Council.
However, in all the documents published by Mr. Snowden, nothing to date indicates that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Political men expressed concern at the idea that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believes that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A German MP says we should create a German Google.
I can't just close my eyes and open them slowly...
"This is not the right way to do it," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German company software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we did not have to let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, passing through farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, the magnitude and sophistication of the American espionage agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations was a shock to some companies who up until then thought that China was the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials are aware of the fact that data stored in the United States is governed by the laws of this jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional agency, about 10% of non-American members have given up their plans to use an American cloud storage service provider after revelations on the US Data Exploration Program Prism.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says: "Our clients today ask us a question that they did not ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you assure me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data should therefore be kept at any price.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been.
"It has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has changed fundamentally in the context of the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Director General of the manufacturing company BASF Chemicals.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially, just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to reveal the prevention measures they have put in place, if that would leave the advantage to an opponent.
The large companies have long had the message that it is at least unwise to recover a free USB key at a professional lounge or leave a laptop without surveillance in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi car manufacturer's board of directors, says that the collection of mobile phones before the council meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for many years.
The BfV in Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones prepaid when travelling abroad due to the risk of contact with the integrity of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorised access," BfV warns in a report.
The United States warns its own companies about the economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States, cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, as guilty of second-degree acts of economic information piracy, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former director of the French Interior, DCRI, said in a interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
Parents of a Georgian teenager, who dies in unusual circumstances, think their son has been murdered
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, whose body was found in a carpet of fighting in the gymnasium of her high school, think their son was murdered, said the family's lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in Georgia, was found on January 11th in a taped standing behind the grades of his high school.
The investigators of the Sheriff of the County of Lowdes concluded that Johnson was dead in unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy's family contests these conclusions.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, lawyer representing Kenneth and Jaquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the Sheriff's conclusions.
"They think this is a logical challenge, the laws of physics and common sense," Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person(s) responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a cartridge and made him into a morgue bag," he added.
The U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore expressed himself at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'm going to follow the facts, wherever they go.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson was killed by "positional asphyxia".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he updates the elements of nature to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to carry it out.
The representative of the sheriff's office in the County of Lowdes was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge ordered the authorities to return all video surveillance records that the investigators had examined on Wednesday.
Adolescent parents said they expected video images to contain clues about the circumstances of their death.
CDC publishes advice on allergies in children at school
Wednesday, the U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines on how to manage child food allergies at school.
This is the first series of guidelines published by the U.S. government, as the number of children of school age who suffer from food allergies has increased greatly.
A child in 20 in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in the child increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to sensitize the teaching body and staff to food allergies in the child and how to treat them in case of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have an epinephrine stock – the EpiPen brand auto-injector being the most commonly used – to be able to react quickly in case of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The legislative assemblies of States recently updated regulations to enable schools to have more easily of epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I feel something like I'm getting my tongue", "I feel like I'm having a hair on my tongue" or "I'm having bites on my tongue."
The NSA case highlights the total lack of debate on information
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which takes place in public by summoning the US ambassador on 21 October, and by the other banning the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the noise of the presence on its board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when the Minister of Foreign Affairs Laurent Fabius calls the US ambassador, they respond to a real discovery, which is the extent of American surveillance over all communications in France.
Isn't it surprising to read in the columns of the World in a few weeks' time, on the one hand, the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand, a condemnation of the hearings of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't there be a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but a search for the interest and relevance of information that enables every citizen to have an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis by American diplomacy of political issues or others around the world, we consider that, in the view of American power, this is an important enlightenment.
When we describe the US interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is not in any case to make us angry with this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France received information from the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we get rid of the U.S. collaboration?
The establishment of very powerful technological interception tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
In this area, France and the United States have, in particular, established procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily, which are described on the one hand and on the other as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to American services, and, on the contrary - it has already been said quickly - Americans can provide information to the French on other regions of the world.
Thus, the substantive question behind this NSA case is not so much the capacity or right of countries to have access to interception tools, as is the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly in Parliament, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and finally the issue of conflicts with freedoms.
What do the United States really risk? a degradation of their image?
It's nice to tell them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk posed by Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case in Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have developed.
Another effect may be more economic: more and more European or South American companies refuse, in the light of the revelations, to provide their confidential data to US suppliers under American law, and thus to the NSA.
Last element: the vast movement of revelations undertaken by the media around the world, which contributes to the launch of a debate on the monitoring practices of information services until almost non-existent, could lead legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their information services.
Parents of intersexual children can choose "unspecified sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of the newborns will no longer be attributed to them, in a rigid way, to the birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be obliged to report the sex of their child, allowing them to register an "unspecified" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions about a sexual re-assignment surgery for their infants and to combat discrimination against the intersexuals.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors have created, confused and embellished.
A child of 2,000 is believed to be born every year, not a boy or a girl.
They are intersexual, the intersexuality of the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorder, a generic term that designates people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testiculars) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to assign it, then wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, where appropriate.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and a specialist in sexual identification issues, said that the new German law "seems to be a good idea".
Intersexual children have an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case of most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how identity develops.
Science that is about how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersexuals as different from transgenders, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively that of a man or exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics may manifest themselves in secondary sexual characters (such as muscle mass, pylosity, chest and stamina), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender persons in the field of employment, as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young boys of non-conformity now have special destinations.
Australia and Nepal already authorize adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized as "neutral" after having won his trial in appeal, which allows him to keep a "unspecified" sex alive.
German passports will include a third designation next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of Interior.
In France, gender issues are always the subject of controversy, according to a report published on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from this country's land-based Catholic country signed a petition for the "theory of genders" to be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online also opposed the German law, writing that "since the world is drawn into a new realm where the kind is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are reversed."
In Maryland, the mother of a baby also said about Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex be attributed to babies at birth.
"The role of parent is sufficiently stressful without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the beautiful Greek god who had a double sex.
And hardly a decade ago, the medical community considered the kind as a chardoise, that one can be deleted and on which one can be redesigned.
But now there are many who challenge the ethical foundation of the surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors may stumble, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual re-assignation when he grows up.
“ In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency, ” Drescher said.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with ambiguity sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money, from Johns-Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be malignant.
He devoted the term "sexual identity" and supported that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with the genes and hormones of a child to shape it so that it would be identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as "John/John", his theories led to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a young boy whose penis had been cut off during a brackish circumcision to cast it completely, by also taking the testicles away, and raising it as a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but that was not the case," Drescher said.
At about the age of 15, he returned a boy and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “always repeat this model. ”
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who have survived these sex-change operations say, "[that]they are not satisfied with the result."
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguity sexual organs.
Doctors could not really say whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfying life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent a surgical ablation from the external body and testiculars and was raised as a daughter.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At 18 years of age, he suffered a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was not going on, he asked for his medical records.
What he discovered made him horrified.
I was sterilized at birth – and nobody ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone so that his sexual organs could develop.
After learning the truth, a man returned after a testosterone treatment and was removed.
The surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersexuals.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director-general of the non-profit organization based in California Lawyers for Informed Choice, fears that German law "is inviting labelling and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that the German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their child an "unspecified" sex," she said.
We are afraid that she will encourage the interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we didn't see what the law was going to give, so we can only advance assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said that his organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the third-sex title."
"Adolescents should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind," she added.
The German Act deals with the allocation of sex to birth.
It's not a battle that young children should lead at that age.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist who specializes in mammographies in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is affected by a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law would "responsibly" parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called a complete insensitivity syndrome for androgens.
Due to the failure of her androgens receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She's got a vagina, but she doesn't have uterus or ovaries.
Today 29 years of age, Katie is married and internal in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or portable mothers.
"The law leaves some room for parents not to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.
This leaves them time to do some tests and understand them, and a period before entering "male" or "female".
So it's all right – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of parenting.
You don't have to rush for a surgical intervention that is irreversible.
"This puts children at the heart of the decision and reduces the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what they need," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he/she feels more comfortable – and that is something amazing.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Leta trusted in the longevity of her government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta considers that his government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between the left and right within the coalition to power in the approach of the Senate's vote to abolish Silvio Berlusconi's mandate.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the left-wing leader said to have "strongly the intention" to continue to rule with his coalition until the next legislative elections in 2015.
The High House of the Italian Parliament will meet in the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council condemned for tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support from the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than partisans, declares his resignation.
But a part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL), Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated last October by his refusal to surrender to the injunctives of Berlusconi that already wanted to bring the cabinet down.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the US Transportation Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the firefighting.
Firearms called on the drama sites have claimed to have responded to a call made by "multiple wounded".
"The forces of the order are in place," says the airport on its Twitter account, while television images showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," the AFP stated a spokesman for the US Transport Security Agency (TSA).
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a branch card, and a second transport on a wheelchair.
The incident took place at around 9.30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. in Montréal) at terminal 3 of the airport, also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times states that the 2 and 3 terminals are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was unable to confirm immediately if one of its employees was injured.
All flights to and from the airport have been suspended.
The Israeli army kills a member of the Hamas in Gaza-Sces
Israeli charismatics shot on Thursday killed an Islamic Palestinian militant of Hamas and brutally injured another in the south of the Gaza Strip, learned from sources of health services.
A source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in this region, because Israeli chariots crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortar shots.
The Israeli army was pleased to address a "targeted action" in the area near a well-qualified "terrorist" tunnel by the Jewish State, which was crossed the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign considered to be a falling Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors to President Barack Obama planned, in the most secret, to replace Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most remarkable event in the very expected book of the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times received a copy of the book to appear and reported on Thursday night that the president's close collaborators had carried out "in-depth work in groups and polls at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's escape could help Obama in his re-election as his hopes declined.
According to Times Political Correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of the campaign and the White House, namely the former Secretary-General of the White House Bill Daley, to measure the effect that the replacement of the vice-president by the former Secretary of State Clinton could have on the vote.
The possibility of a trade is a secret that has been thoroughly stored in the Chicago campaign QG and inside the oval office.
Only half a dozen close advisors of the president – including Daley, the former leader of the Obama campaign Jim Messina and the former advisors at the White House David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was under way.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley has carried out the task of replacing Biden, despite their "close personal links", before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "would not significantly improve Obama's chances of success".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said that I had examined a whole series of questions, and that was one of them," Daley said in the newspaper.
Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, so we were told, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley qualified as a "con concerted" review, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had a lot of investment to find out if the change would benefit from the vote.
"The campaigns don't spend much money on polls and discussion groups unless they're serious about taking action," said Martin on AC360.
However, we do not know if Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement.
Martin said about CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss was aware of any change.
Although Daley said that he did not think that the president "was aware" of any change, the former secretary-general admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had known.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not respond definitively to the question of whether the political surveys had come to Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that Biden's escape from the presidential list was being examined.
"Perhaps," answered Martin.
You want a fluo ice?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent ice in the world based on medusa.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminous collision.
He had the idea of this after reading a study on the medusas and convinced Chinese scientists to reclaim the brilliant protein chemically.
The ice cream reacts with the language by increasing protein pH to make it bright.
Chris explains that since ice cream starts to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more milk we milk, the more it becomes bright.
Charlie, the founder of the ice company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", said: "It's something incredible but we're still only in the beginnings of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about £200."
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the neutral pH language.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH increases and the ice goes out.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives a brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've ever created because the light of the meads is worth four times more than gold.
So every ball costs me about $140.
But she tastes pretty good!
Charlie's experimental approach society, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But its next creation is even more ambitious.
He added, "I would really like to develop an invisible ice."
It is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that constitute the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
The ice uses fluorescent properties of the medusa synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a Thai chi session
The singer Lou Reed died while doing Thai chi exercises, he revealed his wife Laurie Anderson on Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" to the inhabitants of the town of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning, while watching the trees and performing the famous 21st Thai chi movement, with his hands of musicians who were blowing the air," writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was the master of the chi, a Chinese martial arts.
The singer's wife also explained that she had promised her husband the week before her death, to get her out of the hospital and take her to their house in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we're citizens, it's our spiritual home.
"He was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs on the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of living that he had," she added.
Lou Reed had a fever scratch last May.
Halloween 2013 : In figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and drive us to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more pinger.
In the last two years, I haven't distributed one candy and I'm certainly not going to do it any more this year.
But the states show that I'm the gay sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion in candy, decorating and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to every Halloween party is trends.
The disbursements should represent $1.2 billion over the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, sexy inanimate objects get angry.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizzas, burgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the television series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men of the Daft Punk space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after discounts are zombies, Batman, pirates and mercenaries.
I guess there's nothing wrong with being traditional.
We tasted our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million in animal jewelry this year, according to the NRF.
It makes a lot of cute dogs tasted in hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't make it.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion in bonuses this year, according to the Nielsen firm.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, sucetes, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is a great news for 41 million children who go hunting for candy in their neighborhood, according to the US Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, we don't tell stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Maize beans are the only thing we don't want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion corn grains.
It's a mystery that I haven't been able to elucidate yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than the houses that have been used.
They bear the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Screen" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 houses officially recognized in the United States, which generate about $500 million of revenue, according to the America Haunts, and this includes these wonderful photos of you as you are pissing on what your friends put on Facebook and that you can't remove and on which a guy you love very much leaves a comment in the "beautiful head" style.
Finally, let's talk about lemons.
Charlie Brown presented The Great Citrus when we were boys, and sculpture a citrus in the shape of a lantern, it's like decorating a Christmas tree – it's something we've been doing since we've been little.
Fortunately for us, the "baby-citrolysis trend" began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these potions and did not have to sit in them.
This year, the Americans will spend around $106 million in citrolliums, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The latent lemons that fluttered gently over the pores of your house probably came from Illinois, where 542 million lemons were cultivated this year.
If you're trying to make you notice more, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal deficit structure ("bad bank") comprising 38 billion books (EUR 45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to relax its relationship with London and accelerate its privatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of suspicious assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleared it in the next three years.
RBS also said that it would include a provision for depreciating the suspicious claims of four to 4.5 billion pounds per quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantoning structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free between 10 and 11 billion books of capital, thus strengthening its ability to lend.
The bank and London pointed out that the "bad bank" would make it possible to draw a deal on the past, and the government, in particular, had been accused of engaging in the management of the RBS.
"We can now move forward, we worry about the future and 90% of the assets that constitute a really good bank and build a large bank for the clientele and the UK," said the new Director General Ross McEwan in the press.
Land Rover announces his sponsorship of a series of rallyes
The interior has six-point bacterium seat and a Intercom system.
Among the options, include improved brakes, a service giving access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, Director General of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The rally lovers who join Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and real access to international events.
We are very happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try various forms of rallying in the United Kingdom and the international, and to prepare for the rigours and realities of raiding rallying.
We had a lot of fun to develop the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship will really be palpitating.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will propose a day of training and testing in February and the possibility of participating in events in the North and Middle East deserts.
The firefighters were called to rescue a lost shell after being stuck at 15 m above ground on an unstable frame in a career
Ruby, a cocker's spaghetti, had escaped after a road accident without gravity
It was recorded three days later by a person who walked his dog stuck in the career
The firefighters came down in memory along the cliff to recover the dog and save her from a certain death.
A bat had the chance to escape the worst after the firemen were called to recover it safely while it was lost 15 m above the ground on the unstable floor of a façade.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker, escaped after an accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for only three days before being saved in a Wednesday career.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25 years old, and his little friend Becky Hall, 20 years old, went to the career of Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They desperately sought out their lost dog and launched a call on social networks sites after she disappeared in the career following an accident without gravity.
About 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a person with a keen eye that was walking his dog noticed Ruby on a corner in the career, which was 15 m above ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton firehouse went to the places and came down in memory to save Ruby using a animal caviar to transport it to the top of the cliff.
The technical assistance specialist Andy Clayton said: "She was in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the valley, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She had absolutely not moved during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies after.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical rescue specialist Peter Lau said: "Ruby had a lot of chance of getting out of it."
She could have been badly injured or worse.
Ruby was conducted at the veterinarian for a check; his general condition was satisfactory, except for dehydration and dehydration.
Mrs. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said, "I was terrified by observing the relief."
I didn't think she was up there at first.
It was amazing to have it back in my arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and had been evaporated, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were hot.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely formidable.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were afraid that she would fall, but she did not move."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger said he never took Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview during an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was choristic about Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "He loved me when I was 18 years old."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and it was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger said he "did not categorically make any progress in Katy Perry".
The representative added, "Perhaps she's confused with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism", landed in the first place of the charts this week.
Beijing provokes a Turkish Islamic movement
"Turkey attack support has come from the Islamic Movement of East Turkey based in Central and Western Asia," said the Chinese security authorities' boss at a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on Thursday night on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), spoke at Tachkent on an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time that a Chinese official designates a special organization after Monday's assassination.
According to the Chinese police, three Uighurs of the same family of the Muslim-dominated region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their fuelled cars against the entry of the prohibited city in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two and 40 wounded.
The driver of the car, his wife and mother lost in the car fire.
Etim, who claims to fight for the independence of East Turkey, the former name of the Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated with Al-Qaida.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disturbances in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The outbreak of Europe gives the Scotlands a choice
Another day, another worrying story of independence.
This time, we are expected that an independent Scotland will have to join the European Free Movement Area in order to join the EU.
And here we hear passport control stories in Berwick and a border of barbeled son-in-laws along the Hadrian wall.
If it is true that Strathclyde's journal has indicated the possible economic consequences of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not, however, in the major titles (and is to be expected).
No one has said that the EU Member States devote a large part of their time to cross their formal rules when they are arranged.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area for the time being, a non-conformity of the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for all it wants from the Scotlands.
So it's a story that's not one of them.
And a story so old that it is now fixed: for the first time I heard the drumard saying "independence means passport control" over 40 years ago.
However, we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty account.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why exchange the yoke of London against Brussels, especially now?
This is the real reality for Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at the point of death.
With the euro crisis, the European Project is officially dead.
Throughout Europe, the parties who oppose the EU or who fight for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency, gain from the ground.
Even in Germany, the Alternative Eurosceptic Party for Germany, founded only this year and came nowhere, gathered nearly five million votes during the federal elections in September and came out of the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) of the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the federal European project.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the Carcan weighing on national economies through its accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that the European Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has nothing to do with national governments that record excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has weighed on its members the exchange rates that are favourable to German exporters – what German politicians want to preserve.
Without the possibility of evaluating the national currency, the countries of southern Europe are facing an intrinsic productivity problem for Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in public salaries and expenses – encouraged by Berlin.
In addition to the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise related to productivity in Europe.
Following the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels – which is a reason for subsidising French and German companies in the energy sector at consumer prices – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a cost-reduction problem, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wages in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalised by a good-market American ski lift gas.
As a result, the revolt spreads, in particular in France, one of the EU's major leaders.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy to drift away.
Result: the extreme right-wing party of Marine Le Pen, the National Anti-European Front, has just won a crucial partial election, sending the Socialists back to power in the third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the suffrage – an appropriate warning for the British Labour Party, which reminds him that it cannot depart from the principle that a right-hand split will automatically favour the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use European elections next year to create a single anti-monetary and anti-European bloc within the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties are good at these elections, which is very possible, such a block could be controlled by the European Parliament for the first time.
That is what I think: very soon, the single anti-European and anti-money sentiment in Europe will unite and end up killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something more similar to the free Europe of the Nations (superior) privileged by the General of Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could preserve the euro, but France and South Europe will find their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to take its distance from this project, and I hope that it will make the United States a soft eye.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left on its own in the Atlantic.
And Scotland, in all this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (mainly).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a more freer European agreement if we kept our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The Scottish SNP government is – and is to be noted – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed dark cuts (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the labour force, Alistair Darling, and the conservative/liberal-democratic coalition that followed.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Older early
Studies show that young Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than young white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
Nothing proves that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced among boys
CNN Pat Etheridge's former correspondent is a child's family and health journalist.
Should a mother worry if her daughter's boobs and hair begin to grow to 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual American Academy of Pediatrics conference held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring my parents – generally this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty," Kalowitz said.
The obvious signs of development, such as boaring the breasts, hair under the arms and in the Pubian zone and body smells, appear earlier in girls.
But there has only been a slight increase in the age of the first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, while it was 12 and three quarters in 1970.
"When the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also the author of "early puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem".
Time is the most precise test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the real appearance of puberty, but it is considered "early" when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows or stops – something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster evolution can justify tests carried out by an endocrinologist to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and to prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and a small size in the adult age.
The recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the rate of affective maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with medications but recognizes that "the fact that controlling puberty can mitigate some behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others".
The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will manage hygiene issues," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her first ten-year-old rules.
Although there were signs and we talked about the rules, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came back from school to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories of public knowledge about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment or sexual messages carried by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, get their puberty sooner.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is the epidemic of obesity.
He participated in a study conducted on girls aged 6 to 9 who linked the percentage of fat to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, young Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than young white girls.
There are several explanations.
At the global level, early puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to climate, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their face and in the younger Pubian area, the trend towards a real early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference insisted on the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even among infants and grandchildren.
"We must be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty," said Dr Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-endocrinologist working at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than planned," Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will react in general.
Girls whose puberty is early must be assured that even if this happens sooner than expected, the process is part of life.
Honoring the People of the Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by Brother Coen, the Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film on the Greenwich village of 1961 and popular music that began to resonate with it before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective to the French Cinematics, drew the Golden Palm to Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Lack of power to hire Dylan or the Trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their return on the star amount of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the planetary pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humourous film where music is a central character and the songs interpreted live, Oscar Isaac is a performer and folk singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich fangs in "Gatsby the Beautiful" for less shiny clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the oath owes it to the machine when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about a week of the tribulations of a folk singer who doesn't get to see and get angry with the whole earth.
He accepts the replacements on foot in the studios.
Without housing, he's making a tour of his friends' sofas that still want to receive him.
Documentary air
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of evil, a man who is not there at the right time, who is not a careerist but integrated, with self-destructive behavior," said Ethan Coen, coroned with his brother Joel from several Oscars and prizes in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music fans built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the time before the Greenwich Village event, this New York district called to become "the epicenter of the essor of folk music that would produce international stars" as written by journalist Elias Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes documentaries, dusty 33T music label invahi built by an impeccable old secretary, musical choices of the era studios and cafes where the singers were produced.
The magic of the Coen brothers is still working by integrating a play of character that passes through the film permanently: a beautiful red cat looking cracking, lucky companion of Llewyn Davis.
Questioned about how he composed his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled having "great in Tennessee, bathed by the blues and the country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary for "to be considered as good", "the gambling can also start someone's career", and "more and more today".
As Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise his music, the star pop explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get caught up in anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", died.
He'll never know the word retired.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, died on Thursday at 83 years of age, was just published by his 200th SAS, "The Revenge of the Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times devoted it as "the author of spying novels who knew too much about it".
He then spent ten days in Afghanistan, a 198 and 199 works of the famous series of espionage novels.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart accident in December 2010, he moved on this journey with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he was also assigned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published a year, Gérard de Villiers, born December 8, 1929 in Paris, would make sure to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"No doubt between 120 million and 150 million all confused countries," he moved on last March.
His Burmese chat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment of an apartment of the Foch Avenue in two steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the malignant eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting the pirate editions," he added, designing a pile of books on the low table between the bronzes or reported ivorians of the 130 Arpente countries to place their novels there.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader has the right to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman at the advantage of the chest, carrying a gun or a sucker gun.
Inside, its very serene height (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, aristocrat of Austria disparate and CIA contractual agent to pay for the repairs of the family castle, is launched at the gates of all the earth's wicked, communists of the 1970s and 80s, and then jihadists from the 1990s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitical and exoticism, a few scenes of hard sex, a set of violence and torture.
"I never had the claim to be a literary author," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I think I'm like a counter that writes to distract people I don't send a message to.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, like Albert London, who went on the spot and returned with real and long investigations".
SAS's father said "make a kind of geopolitical sheet."
"I am always my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," Gérard de Villiers added.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those of the AFP, diplomats, people I have known for some 20 or thirty years.
Suddenly, many of its SASs are often premonitioned: thus, a month before the attack of a command center of the Syrian regime that had killed several high officials, he had told the story in "The Road of Damascus".
In "Les Fouss de Benghazi", he had been the first to reveal the existence of a CIA secret command center in this city, the berzej of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The plot of Cairo", one year before the assassination.
In October 2012, in "Panique in Bamako", he reported the columns of 4X4 jihadists based on Malian capital.
I'm not a guess, I was defending Gérard de Villiers, I'm just making assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these travels in frequently troubled areas, he installed his machine a month ago to write IBM to Marguerite from 1976 "where all the parts have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page in the style.
At the walls of his office, AK-47, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords are hung.
Regularly cornered by feminist leagues and racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I'm always very welcome in Africa where I have a lot of readers.
Gérard de Villiers said, "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not old."
He won't die and he won't retire.
Not more than me.
Airplanes want about the width of seats while large commands are in play
The dispute rages among the major aeronautical builders about the width of the tourist class seats on long-distance flights, opening the way to bitter confrontation at the Dubai aeronautical salon that takes place this month.
The conflict focuses on the width of the seats proposed for long-term flights to the passengers of the economic class – which are not always the most briefed by airlines, but to which the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aeronautical industry to set up a standard that imposes a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its major American rival Boeing states that it should be for airlines to decide.
The dispute erupted as the airmen were seeking to sell even larger versions of their bi-engine long-run aircraft, possibly waiting for a record of orders during the event that would take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which seats will be available at the rear of the plane – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the "mini-jumbo" segment.
Boeing states that its refurbished "777X" will be able to accommodate 406 people in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competitive version of its A350 will transport 350 persons in economic class in 18 inches wide in order of 9.
Aeronautics giants often exchange strikes on technical issues by making advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before the Dubai Aeronautics Room, where 777X should take action on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
A recent report on what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the finance of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "What would you accept?"
"Boeing offers long-term flights in tighter seats than in regional turbopropulsors," said John Leahy, commercial director of Airbus.
As food habits change, people grow, but seats in planes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 defined the modern long-term travel, and the turning of the century, the average American weight of 40 to 49 years increased by 10 per cent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The size of the average American in the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus states that its rival adheres to a seating concept dating from the 1950s, when the circuit of the newly baptized "get set" device was closer.
Airbus adds that it commissioned a study indicating that an additional drop in seat width would improve the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing answers Airbus' figures regarding the width of seats and claims that it is not for the builders to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that cabin experience does not depend only on the width of the seats.
"It is really about providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they should do to carry out their activities," said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will allow them to be profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly a question that could affect their results.
After the dispute, a race to air orders for an estimated market price of at least $700 Md in the coming decades is under way, enough to bring the balance of US and European exports to a balance.
As Reuters indicated for the first time in July, the configuration of the seats is exactly what feeds the battle between the last devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim one per seat performance in their latest models of long-term motors 20 % higher than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 model of origin configured in rows of 9.
The unit cost gain is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing does this in order to be able to accommodate more seats and make its aircraft more competitive by relation to our products," said Kevin Keniston, Director of Comfort Passenger at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins set up with 10 seats per row in the 777 existing ones suggest that many passengers speak in favour of a more dense configuration, which can be paired with cheaper tariffs.
"A seat width of 18 inches would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat of 777," said the expert inside Mary Kirby cabins, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but they offer a supplier catalogue, among which airlines must choose.
Air sellers who make the round of the world even carry a meter with them to check the competing configurations.
While offering comfortable equipment, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations for low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it hasn't sold it yet.
Up until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater customization of cabins by offering wider seats on some of its planes.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern appliances, experts say that it is unlikely that its appeal to the aeronautical industry will set up a size standard for the seats to be completed, but that it could make it forget the sales gap of 777X.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted on Thursday against the compensation proposal for the founder and CEO Larry Ellison, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding, but the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just aerialed from the victory of his ship at the U.S. Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group that it co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had voted negatively on his remuneration.
Oracle's boss has given up a $1.2 million bonus for the fiscal year 2013 closed in May because of the group's poor performance, which has failed to achieve its growth goals, but has gained about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is just a symbolic dollar.
Over the entire financial year in 2013, Oracle's net profit has grown by 3.5%, while the profit of Bodi Borse has increased by 27.5%, exceeding the S&P-500 index that has taken 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotinic vaccine could eliminate the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotinic vaccine that could eliminate the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mice alive from nicotine dependence.
Other tests are needed before testing on the human being begins, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Well Cornell Medical College in New York said the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods available on the market today, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an inoffensive virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotinic antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the cells of the liver, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
The antibodies trace all nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, thus preventing the smoker from having its dose of nicotine.
During tests, the vaccineed mice to which nicotine was subsequently given continued their activity normally.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated "were pampered", the researchers said, sign that nicotine had reached their brain.
Experiences are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines were ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so often that levels of antibodies remained high that they were too expensive and little practical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms the liver cells into antibodies plants.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human-use vaccine was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the anti-nicotinic vaccine, and this will help them to lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists said that the results were interesting but reported that much more thorough research was needed.
The leader of Pakistani Taliban killed by a drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a hit by an American drone on Friday in Pakistan, learned from security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But those responsible for the information, the army and the activist movement said this time that he had lost his life in this attack, which was carried out in the North-Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a senior security officer.
The Watchman, Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, moving to London, had informed the British government that discussions had been initiated with Tehran and Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi is not influenced by Obeid
The former New Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the State Anti-Corruption Regulator.
The former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi refused to change the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three property located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to find out if Mr. Obeid had pressured several government ministers to renew his bowls in Circular Quay, where the Obeids had two restaurants and a coffee, after their expiry in August 2005, without any call for tenders.
She now investigates the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of the former Deputy Secretary-General of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
During the years of discussions started in 2005, the government pressured the banks to make bids.
The tenants were opposed and also wanted longer periods.
In 2009, the leases for Circular Quay companies, which related to Obeid about $2.5 million a year, were renewed without any call for tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was at the start of the tenders.
But he refused to change his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, recognized Mr. Tripodi, demanded a change in the government's policy in the field of mud.
The transcription of telephone conversations presented to ICC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived in the Ports Department after working under the orders of Mr. Obeid in the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the development of the policy on commercial leases discussed during these telephone conversations?" Deputy Commissioner Anthony Wheely asked Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but in any case, it wasn't that.
In any case, it's certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, declaring a responsible
Israeli warplanes reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, confirming a military officer in Fox News.
The manager did not specify the target, but said there was at least one target.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian production missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel has launched air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers with a visa 457 may have to pass a "authenticity" test
The Government is currently considering the possibility of establishing a "authenticity" test for foreign workers in possession of a visa of 457 while considering extending the measures of repression.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion designed to prevent 457 visas from being used to occupy unqualified positions or as a diversional means of bringing his family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was released today, while working MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's speech on foreign workers, saying he could offend the neighbours of Australia.
"The failing statements about "foreigners returning to the end of the file" and "jobs for Australians first" are a distasteful return at the time when trade unions demanded a protected labour market," she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites should be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historic artefact.
The working paper describes the 12 measures previously envisaged by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, implemented five of the recommended changes, while the others are under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to see "if the job offer is authentic in the case of a relationship or personal associate of the owner or person concerned within the sponsoring company".
Companies could also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker would die of a heart attack after arriving on a ship carrying asylum-seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The prodigal son of the man, 9 years old, had come to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father’s death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start as soon as Phase 1 opening in 2026.
The Minister of Transport Baronne Kramer stated that the project "would bring together the United Kingdom".
The Scottish Minister of Transport Keith Brown called himself "excite" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will be on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government increased the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the north of England, from £31.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of railway capacity and the improvement of the length of the journeys to the north of England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of a three-hour journey between Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Baronne Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is to build a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer together."
We push the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are enormous.
Without it, we are facing a capacity problem of our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that links between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support "no mistake" the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland in the overall high-speed rail network project throughout Great Britain.
"We are therefore excited about the idea of working in partnership with the British government in order to examine options for bringing the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the line Glasgow-Edimburg that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I am eager to read the review report with the British ministers next year and we will then decide all of the next steps."
The rules on the use of on-board electronic devices remain in force for the moment in Australia
Australian air passengers will have to continue to expand their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the United States gesture aimed at facilitating electronic devices regulation.
The Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in "air".
Passengers can already do it during most of the flight, but many people find it painful not to be able to access their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering a decision that obliges American carriers to perform important work to meet the requirements, but they have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was examining the ad but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
"CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft," she said.
The issue is the subject of a regulation that obliges aircraft operators to ensure the continuous maintenance of safety and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who had already spoken to CASA of her intention to extend the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but said she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a revision of the CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve customer experience now that we have (from the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft," said a spokesman.
Quantas stated that she was in compliance with the current rules for the time being.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately," she said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the decision of the FAA and the reasons for it.
For American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their planes can tolerate radio interferences from electronic devices, as well as checking the manuals, training equipment, hand luggage programs and instructions provided to passengers.
"As soon as an airline has checked the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices such as tablets, electronic book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to extend their equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that the heavier devices be placed safely under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four injured in a violent baccarare
The small town of Pia has experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a collection of thirty persons according to the evidence collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was on the side of Pia, where a race involving several people exploded on the side of the Post.
At least four minor injuries would be to be regretted.
Alerted, the gendarmes went into place to separate the wounded and to ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore's gambling lenders benefit from the average classes forced to close the belt
Janani Amirthalinga holds a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earring loops to pay for the school fees of her daughters at the Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is gone," says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the application is such in some parts of Southeast Asia – where the debt of households is increasing – that ValueMax, where it has carried out its transaction, has become the third bank loan company to be introduced to Singapore's stock exchange this week.
Making jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthhalinga – but it is almost as good a market as non-guaranteed bank loans.
In general, Singapore's loan lenders receive an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local funder with a branch in the same commercial centre.
However, bank lenders have the advantage of not asking for a check of solvency or wage evidence, and they can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to bankers while families feel the pressure to increase the cost of living and overrun of households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and the good market credit provided by a monetary policy that is too laxative in advanced economies, low-income and middle-income families turn to crediters on credit to cover the difference while their economies are slowing down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency cited the growing debt of households, mainly due to the rise in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had recorded the ratio of persistently gross domestic product to the highest in Asia.
Malaysia comes on the list with 80% of GDP, while this rate was 60% in 2008.
Economists are also afraid of the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which came out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing lack of exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The balance is that with the increase in costs, people in the middle or bottom [of the salary scale] are trying to complete their income as they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high prices of gold over the past two years have forced people to pay for their personal effects to touch the value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, approximately 70 per cent of the items in the 200 loan shops in the city are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's put the gold chain on and we'll be looking for it again next month."
In Thailand, easyMoney, the largest bank loan shop operator, has recorded an increase of 20 per cent of customers using its shops over the past few months.
The increase is such in the stock loan sector as ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer store and of 15 other shops such as that in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside Asia, says Yes Lee Ching, its Director General.
The company will finance them using 60 per cent of Singapore's $66 million that it raised this week at its introduction to Singapore's stock exchange.
While some low-rate borrowers have challenged the criticism of the exorbitant interest rates that they are practicing, Ms. Yeah points out that the loan offers not only lower rates than other borrowers, but also does not directly increase debt.
"Customers mortgage assets that they already own, and currencyizing their personal assets does not increase the debt of households," she said.
The investment is better socially accepted as a means of obtaining a guaranteed short-term funding.
People who go to the banks are not only those who have financial problems.
The easy people in Singapore also go to the ValueMax loan shops to pay for gold lingots or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase prices.
We see customers from all levels of society.
"It may be easy people who need to borrow in the short term for business activities or investments, or small businesses who have cash needs to pass a difficult cap," she adds.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of juvenile pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who took care of young people in the Halifax region in Nova Scotia is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and at the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist Church of Timberlay, where the pastor was an official, was deeply attuned to this news.
In a communiqué, church officials indicate that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his position.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not contact people under the age of 18 and not access the Internet.
It will be compared in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes in Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before being kicked off
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform surrounded by a brewed cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, with customers complaining to the head of the facility that called the police, said the shop on Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesman for the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police for the rescue, but "the time she arrived, he was already gone without a break," she added.
I was making the tail when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were good mouth.
"You don't go out in the street like this unless you want to draw attention," said one customer, Rosina Rusin, 60 years old, in Cambridge News.
This incident took place on Thursday, Halloween Day, where it is customary to take off in a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a canal.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted pictures of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS brassard twice a week at Asda for three years," said Paul Dutton, explaining suffering from "mental problems."
Saving plan of $325 M for the Tasmanian health system
The federal government maintains that the 325M rescue plan for the vacillation health system is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the government does not waste funds.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking urgent measures to end a crisis caused by the ageing of the island's population, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
Funding, planned for 4 years, was decided after government consultations with the independent Member of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will solve the unique difficulties facing the State," said Ms. Plibersek today.
The $325M plan includes a $31M campaign for non-emergency surgical operations.
2 600 additional operations, particularly in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataracts, will help to catch up with the delay.
Funds are also provided for clinics without attending Hobart and Lanceston, with better external care, training of medical staff, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the idea that, according to first-line clinicians, this is the best way to care for the Tasmanian health system," said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Government of Tasmania would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will have to maintain the current funding levels in order to receive the Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be formed to ensure that the State provides the services as efficiently and as efficiently as possible.
Today, Mr. Wilkie said that $325 million would not count for anything "unless they were followed by a real reform to consolidate the public health system in Tasmania".
However, he commended the Government for responding to the urgent request for assistance presented to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing the public health system from the black list of Tasmania," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the government, these non-emergency additional procedures will in large part reverse the recent coups.
But Peter Dutton, the spokesman for the health opposition, thinks today's announcement is a "a solution of fortune".
"The reason why we are here is that the State laborist government has withdrawn $430 million from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
We cannot have a government of the state that can raise almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that costs $300 million, and pretends it's a long day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollars of the rescue plan would be spent in additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Niceux of Denis Diderot's novel is marked by a remarkable artistic direction and a minute reconstruction of time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
In France in the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces cruelty without the support of a deliberately Sadistic Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never spends in lubrication or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
Consciousness of the narrative could also become a prison sentence for the public.
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, states the monitoring agency
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, said the International Chemical Weapons Monitoring Agency on Thursday, while violent confrontations were taking root in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian militants also said Thursday that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly 3 years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) arrived with a day ahead of the deadline for the
1 November established by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or "make useless" all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must still begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has approximately 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including maturated gas and the sari neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made as the fighting raged Thursday in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, opens a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, reported the Syrian Human Rights Observatory in Great Britain.
The group of militants, following the evolution of the human balance through a network of militants based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government's side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bachar el-Assad's armed forces found death, of which 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 of the opposition combatants, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that figure since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
El Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom are linked to groups of the Al-Qaida network in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory stated on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but it did not provide any clarification.
The fights stressed the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors when they had to complete their mission, which was to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the middle of a long-term civil war.
A statement by the OIAC, working closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was "now satisfied with having controlled – and destroyed – all the critical production and machinery for mixing and filling".
She added that "no other inspection activities were planned for the time being."
Earlier this week, inspectors reported that they had completed the first phase of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors reported.
On Thursday, OIAC said that both sites were, according to Syria, "refused and... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme they contained had been moved to other reported sites, which were inspected".
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that OIAC inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a total plan for the destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved by the OIAC Executive Committee the following month.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage you have all demonstrated in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said Ahmet Uzumcu's CEO, in a comment published by the OIAC.
Now in its third year, civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels in the government of El Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alauite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the Director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory stated that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by the sentence pronounced against one of Bali's bomb holders
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the attacks of Bali in 2002 reacted in anger to the sentence of the last of the conspirators to be put to trial, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years running as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used during the attacks.
It could be released at the end of 15 years under conditional release.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder for the attacks targeting two night boxes in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and caused many injuries.
It was also found guilty of many other charges in connection with terrorism, including a wave of attacks against churches throughout Indonesia in the wake of Christmas in 2000.
Prosecutors have applied for a permanent release penalty, but they could have asked that the man, qualified as "Demolition Man" for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs, be sentenced to death.
The decision reversed painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two twins 39 years old, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction of Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the side of the tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"It should be brought to the execution platoon," Ms. Corteen told the AAP.
I have to live every day without other children, not seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van attached to the outside, exploded just after 23:00 a.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze jumped a back bag carrying explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into the coma the next day of the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he was "dead" three times while he was in breathing aid.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should have known the same way as the other three members of Jemah Islamiyah's terrorist cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed 4 years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keeping it alive, therefore, there is no reason to keep it alive.
Spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others, that's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bomb holders to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the American forces will kill the former leader of Al-Qaida, Oussama ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated that information services reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in order to restore links between the terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't go," added Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he was baffled by the grief he had caused to others.
The verdict was brought to the attention of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be held later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," said Ms. Corteen.
Patek may, however, appeal for his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use aircraft gadgets (but don't call with their mobile phone)
Passengers from airlines will be able to use their electronic door-to-door devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not to talk on their mobile phone – under the new very expected directives published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be introduced will vary from one airline to another, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Air carriers will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft complies with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals for crew members and the rules on equipment handling for compliance.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from certain airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are part of companies that have already submitted plans.
"In the light of the plan, we could approve an extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA stated in a statement.
Currently, passengers must extend their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They are not supposed to be lit before the aircraft reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the commander gives its green light.
Passengers are supposed to remove their aircraft when the aircraft is landed before landing and not to light them until the aircraft is placed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aeroplanes are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their equipment during take-offs, landings and ground rolling, the FAA said.
Most of the new line and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Waiting, said happy about these changes.
"When the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with the transporters for this – it will benefit everyone," Glading explained in a statement.
We are extremely tired of feeling like "room overseers" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be prohibited to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other aircraft devices in order.
So not always from Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was kicked out loud from an American Airlines plane after refusing to extend his device while the device was locked at the door.
And the heavier devices like portable computers will always have to be sorted because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
On-board mobile phones will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory power for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA may impose a ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were always considered to be at risk.
"The mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone antennas if they are used on board," Rosenker said.
An industrial advisory committee established by the FAA to discuss the problem recommended last month that the government authorize wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased over the last few years to increase the restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become omnipresent.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to extend their devices, or deliberately do so.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on the presence of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers carried FM radios, the high-tech gadget at that time.
New line planes depend much more on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Air carriers have allowed their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
The modified planes to host Wi-Fi systems are also better resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should allow wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions much lower than previous generations of devices.
Electronic book readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when a page is turned.
But the transmissions are stronger when the telecommunications devices or send data.
Amazon.com is part of those who pressure to ease restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the leaders of the company loaded a plane of electronic booksreaders Kindle and made it fly to see if there were any problems, but there was no one.
This has inspired members of the FAO Advisory Committee on Mitigated Feelings on the question of whether or not the use of devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airlines Passengers stated that he thought interference from devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA allow drivers to request passengers to extend their devices during landings to instruments under low visibility conditions.
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them full-fledged arrangements for people with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passerby experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, president and director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicopter bird from a North Sea platform has been released in nature
A bird, helicopterd after being found exhausted on a North Sea oil platform, was released in nature.
The water line was mounted on board a helicopter headed by Aberdeen last month before it was placed on foot by the Scottish SPCA in its rescue centre of Alloa.
The centre director Colin Seddon said: "This water stream was probably a winter migrant who came from northern Europe and was caught in the middle of violent winds in the North Sea."
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find shelter on the oil platform.
He added: "It was impossible to fly again, so we were contacted to provide our help."
The water stream was in good health when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring businesses together and to define what rich and job-creators want to change in our relationship with the EU.
To that end, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive investigation of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, generally representative of all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise for many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and developing while the EU states are stagnant.
They want to see the government give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than to join in the long and hard process of reforming European institutional archives.
When asked for their opinion on specific policy issues – ranging from monopolies regulation to product laws – the majority of business leaders feel that controlling these key competences should return to Westminster's hands.
The single market has led to general discontent, companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate compared to the benefits of the European area of trade – 40% of the major companies, traditionally the most pro-European, are even agreed.
Finally, and more importantly, our investigation with business leaders revealed that an important majority wanted to see Britain pursue initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a trade-based relationship with the EU and not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and businesses of all sizes, shows that the company's world insists on a "significant change" that gives power to the United Kingdom.
Issues are high – to change the Treaty and better represent Britain's interests would allow to see 16% of the vote in favour of the country's maintenance in the EU at a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt one moment: this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies expect renegotiation to be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is engaged in the path of closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the conclusions of our survey show, for businesses this means re-emphasizing trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
United States of America in Halloween colors
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife, yesterday night, he distributed frigies to hundreds of children invited to the gardens of the White House in Washington.
Last year, Halloween's festivals on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passing of the hurricane Sandy.
This year, therefore, the holidays have fallen apart.
In New York, thousands of people customarily participated in the parade organized in the neighborhood of Greenwich Village.
Everyone is excited, tells one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the suit that I had planned last year.
We're having fun like fools, add Rhonda.
People are happy.
He's a good kid, he's cool.
We really need that.
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated in the wake of the Toussaint, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller de Gazprom says Bulgaria's gas pipeline opens a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said Gazprom Director.
"A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, Europe's largest-scale project," explained Alexei Miller, Director General of Gazprom, in a Thursday statement.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream should diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and his counterpart from Ukraine, a country through which most of the Russian gas destined for Europe is transiting, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, adds the Director.
Miller added that direct accession to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the whole project is operational in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other countries below by the end of the year.
The gas pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced Thursday daily The Tahitian News, receiving information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory of the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This area measures 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the mutinies of the Bonty, an episode of the history of the English Navy, which led to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen people, mostly descendants of the Bonty mutants, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95% of London's generosity.
The Council of the Island voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, which corresponds to its exclusive economic area.
An associate to the Mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, Mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand, and by the British government.
However, the creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836,000 km2, provided that it has the means to ensure its supervision, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, making it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to zone surveillance, and there is no port where to place military surveillance ships.
As for France, it must already carry out the very expensive air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian EEA, neighbor to Pitcairn.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese vice-governor
A former vice-president of Jilin Province, north-east of China, was sentenced to life imprisonment for corruption on Friday.
Except for the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of touching more than 19 million pot-vin yuans, reports the official Chinese media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and responsible for obtaining contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared Beijing's first interim court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took up his duties last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, assuming that the phenomenon was a threat to the existence of the Communist Party itself.
If the head of state has promised that justice would be as intrusive with the powerful "tigers" as with the "mouses" - subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials have been convicted, including former oil giant Petrochina's leaders.
The recent most spectacular case was that of the former head of the PCC in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after having targeted the highest functions in the state.
But the government has not expressed any intention to reform the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a hearing of the Royal Commission.
Two employees of the New South Wales YMCA were charged with sexual assault on children following allegations made against the educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing by the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse on Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, YMCA stated that it had "never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization".
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: an employee of the YMCA was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education monitor of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare said to Gail Furness, a counsellor with the Commission, that he had knowledge of the first case but that he was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA opening statement was incorrect by stressing that "the external controls of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that the safety of children was an absolute priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the worst second assessments on four institutions during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities carried out in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they had to report any violations of the child security policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was sentenced for sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum sentence of 6 years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failures to the safety of children.
Staff members testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, that he kept them in private, that he had them sitting on his knees, that he loved them and that he had let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was led by Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about her behavior, said that she was responsible for the services at the YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who was going to bring Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time".
The Director-General said that he rejected the testimony of staff that they were reluctant to report these deficiencies to their superior hierarchy.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relations they had with Lord had clouded their judgment, which did not signal their actions.
Mr. Hare said that he had expressed his view before the Council of the New South Wales YMCA saying that, for the organization, the lesson learned from "Jonathan Lord incident" should not concern "signalling" by staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to make confidentiality agreements staff sign, shortly after the allegations were raised, was taken by the Chief Executive Officer of the YMCA, Liam Whitley, in charge of child services.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was "exceeding zeal" and that it had been misapplied.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed, i.e. between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence on children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University in front of the Commission.
He noted that there were "serious problems" in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was updated until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to return Prime Minister, but he admits that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of her departure at the end of her term of office, 59-year-old man expressed his opinion on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his special mission to the Quartet for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to find the Prime Minister's position, Mr Blair would have replied, according to the London Evening Standard: "Yes, of course, but it could probably happen, so..."
When many experts in equestrian events gathered at Cardiff to face and win the horse's trophe of the year, they knew that the competition would be rough.
But no one expected to win Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old.
Not yet at school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the small and his lady Shetland Toffee broke out during the three rounds with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind them the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable – which are of the same size – were welcomed for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank equestrian centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In front of men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his plate helmet slightly on the side untraceably to show his 2-year-old toffee ponie around the track.
Fenton was greeted by the judges for his natural qualities of little common dressing for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good notes for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd anniversary last March and has been involved with his lady Shetland every day.
His mother, Donna, 30 years old, said, "Fenton and Toffee make a great duo."
They presented themselves to and against everyone, but they both picked up the gold cut and the rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were unhappy with the joy he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a photograph with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the tracks of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air, and everyone encouraged it and praised it."
He spent all the length of the track running and even if he seemed to be a little boy, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
From the way he began, he will certainly participate soon in the manifestation of the Year's Horse – and I am sure he will do a good performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton is only 3 years old, but he knows how to drive his pony."
They're forming a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee presented well and the way they displayed on the track.
They are looking for an effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee have been the best on the track.
I'm sure his pretty clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud of it.
A Chinese journal that launched a "remote" call
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first-page appeal for the release of an accused of defamation journalist will be remedied, says a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou has issued a rare public appeal for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted to television that he had accepted wine pots to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will come up with a "full replacement," the regulator said.
The order of "recast" comes from the administration of Guangdon for the Press and the Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several wrong articles on the company Zoomlion listed between September 2012 and August 2013.
"New Express's drafting was unorganized," the regulator said in a statement.
He indicated that he had decided to "impose an administrative penalty to Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card".
He also "commanded the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete replacement of New Express, and recommended that he conduct an investigation into the persons responsible for New Express and immediately resume the paper management team".
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his journal issued a first-page appeal for his release twice, writing that he supported his journalism.
But then Mr. Chen appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to having published false stories against money.
"In this case, I was born in Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told the CCTV public television network.
I did it mainly because I ran after money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apologies, New Express published his apologies on the first page, writing that he had not properly verified his articles.
Several important suspects have recently made television ads.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to make their own remarks, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to commit themselves.
Charles-de-Gaulle Airport in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the carrier is on fire.
The radioactive steam escape detected on one of Charles-de-Gaulle's two nuclear fuels in mid-October and while the ship was in the sea, was "without danger to the marines", but it is not without consequences for the Marine.
The Royal has come to confirm "the inaccessibility" of the ship to "the mid-November", "the time to take corrective action" on the reactor.
On the other hand, the DCNS company, a specialist in the defence ship, ensures that its teams and those in Areva, which are deployed in the Var for the occasion, are "currently involved on the aircraft".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the faulty fuel.
"Everything is implemented so that Charles-de-Galle can carry out its planned deployment at the end of 2013," explains DCNS.
And the National Navy's certifying that "it does not cause any damage to the ship's activity program" to nuclear propulsion.
Let us recall that the Charles-de-Gaulle carrier leaves a period of intermediate maintenance of six months.
He had equipped Toulon in mid-October for training.
This is, among other things, to qualify young hunting pilots.
A "small avalanche", which is surrounded by the reactor's containment space, was then produced on the admiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Marine, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to find a lot of discontent on the part of the people I meet: a monstrous reassessment of their properties, a discharge of taxes, the cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs to end them.
Brief, unlimited syphony of our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be spared in order to allow for a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money taken away from taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their reduction.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no mention of suptuous spending and the maintenance of housing canaries: deficit cultural centre, strong grant to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, either they are sold to the private company or they are demolished.
It is also intended to note the expropriation of several properties in order to welcome a major industry that has never arrived.
However, I give an honourable mention of the transformation of the former Wabasso into an industrial incubator, but at what cost to taxpayers?
It is not for the public to invest in such companies, but rather for the private sector on the basis of consumer demand.
Citizens were happy to learn that lakes in the Fish and Piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
Following the start of all industries (large water consumers) and the major decline in the population, the use of water has decreased considerably throughout the country.
Without saying to waste it, the city will never lack water and the severe regulation on its use could be very well-adjusted.
In short, it is easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a balance.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city is not even able to buy a style without going through a loan settlement.
We've been managed for over 40 years by croats with beautiful diplomats for most of the time and I don't think a sheep breeder gets worse.
Discovering a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway route
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
The US authorities described the 4-foot tunnel by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret crossings they've ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagan at an equivalent length of nearly six long football pitches, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, the United States.
The area boasts undefinable warehouses, which enables easy to dissipate trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs were responsible by going unnoticed, the authorities said.
The authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel, according to the court case.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine for sale.
They have been sentenced to 10 years in prison for being sentenced to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, traders operate large underground drainage channels.
The tunnel has been the eighth major gateway to San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered following the Marijuana harvest in the center of Mexico in October, thus challenging drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railways that was part of the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went up to two San Diego warehouses.
British police deliver an extradition mandate against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition mandate against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who fled to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked for political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a 40-year-old notice against Australia, asking him to introduce himself to a police commissioner, adding that if he did not, it would be possible to be arrested.
Assange could be extracted in Sweden as a result of allegations of sexual crime, after having exhausted all possible ways under British law after the Supreme Court had invalidated the appeal he had filed against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm authorized his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London on 19 June, asking this country of South America for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asked him to present himself to a police commissioner, on the date and time of his choice," said a spokesman.
It continues to breach the conditions of its release under bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issue of the notice by the police.
He was afraid of being expelled from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after exposing more than 250,000 American diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks' website against classified information.
How biometrics invaded our lives
Finish the password to tap to access his smartphone or pay for his purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho, believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometry will ensure the identity of a person performing transactions in a transversal and transnational universe as well as the Internet .
The organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this commitment to biometry, but worry about it.
In 2011 and France, the National Commission for Computer Science and Freedoms has authorized 774 systems for the recognition of the prints, the form of the hand or the neighbouring network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified, wherever and whenever," said Justin Brookman, responsible for the private life of consumers in the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, one at a time, and one at a time, one at a time?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will allow new services to be provided to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are the digital prints, the surrounding hand and the neighbouring network of the palm or finger.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people who work on concrete have very low fingers and their prints are inaccessible," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the field of identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection, as well as the verification of the neighbouring network and the surrounding of the hand, is a voluntary and specific gesture of people.
It is both a security - we cannot capture this data at their expense - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been carried out for twenty years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the increased accuracy of the sensors and the ability to calculate the computers needed for the analysis of the data, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the last five years, calculated by Cyril Bataller, director of the accenture R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a face or an iris in motion.
"Today, we conduct research on the recognition of voice or how to walk with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," says Sridar Iyangar, director of Intel Labs Security Research.
A unique and infallible marker, DNA also brings hope and anxiety.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Perspective at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers judicial police services a voucher of EUR 90,000 to analyse DNA samples at the scene of a crime and within an hour.
The use of biometrics is divided into two groups: identification (recognizing a person among others) and authentication (to ensure that the person is what it claims to be).
The identification concerned the issue of identity papers so far: biometric elements (prints, photos, iris) must be compared with the information the state has on all citizens already posted.
This enables us to make sure that a person does not try to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus proposes the recognition of VIP at the entrance of a hotel or store.
"We will recover the images from surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities that circulate freely on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, who is responsible for commercial development at NEC France for biometric identification solutions.
Another use: take a photo of someone who's making the tail in a store, follow his progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
The authentication concerned initial physical access (frontiers, protected premises, canteens...) or logical (opening a computer).
More recently, the presence control was added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the peer that points to another," explains Cyril Bataller, of Accenture.
Moreover, authentication will also cover transactions, in particular those made from Internet-connected devices.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by entering his card and placing his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the hit of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the Natural Security company in partnership with large-scale banks and teachings: at the time of paying in store with its bank card, the customer does not type his code, but introduces his finger into a reader who scans the windows.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at the French traders.
Tracks to assure users
There are three ways to make biometric seductive in the eyes of the general public.
The first is to explain that she can make time.
"If, thanks to biometry, a client remains in cash for 30 seconds less, it is valuable," explains the director of a large surface.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you options to measure.
And, finally, reassure by putting in mind the precautions taken to protect databases.
"The digital prints are stored on a first server; the identities of people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which blocks if you try to move it," says Philippe Robin, of Thales.
However, due to extensive studies, it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users.
Private life protection specialists, they, continue to worry.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa makes me afraid of the worst: widespread surveillance," said Andrew Patrick, of the Canadian Privacy Commissioner.
A 210 km/h wheel driver with a hot drink between his legs was struck with a almond of £1,000.
A car driver was charged a fine of £1,000 for traveling 210 km/h with a hot drink placed in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 years old, from Tiptree in Essex, was recorded driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they found the drink to take between his legs.
In the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the conductal offence without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points withdrawn on his permit led to a six-month withdrawal.
Howie was also sentenced to pay a fee of £90 and an extra charge for a victim of £100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to blow up the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally numbered the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision by Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, has entered a 7% stamp right for property that costs more than £2 million and annual costs for buyers who choose to hold property in a company rather than individually.
The stamp right already applies to residential properties of the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents £708 over the fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, Northwest and the assembled Yorkshire and Humber region.
Mr. Cook said: "As a result of the increase in the right of stamp on high value properties and the introduction of anti-avoidance law, it is very difficult to advance that high value properties are subject to the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors resistant to the idea of buying properties in London or the current owners resistant to the idea of selling," he added.
The real estate – the 5-10% of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous sector located in southwestern London, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by 11.8% in the last year.
Prices in the centre of London show regular annual growth of 5.6 % but have been driven by a "internal market" in full growth, the south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) with a recovery, according to Savillas' studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its humour.
Previous studies revealed that happy dogs removed their tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs removed it more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trente, said: "Everyone knows that, in man, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in the stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what was in other species.
He added that, as in man, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that both hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about the way dogs react to other dogs' disordered tail movements, researchers followed animals by watching movies where other dogs were present.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will certainly not take long for us to understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We have presented to dogs of the movies where other dogs – either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other factor of confusion – and we have been able to smuggle the movement of the tail and present it as going to the left or to the right."
When animals saw a dog without expression remove the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog that removes the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they saw a tail, mainly due to the left (once again from the dog's point of view that removes the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they had anxious air.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think that dogs would communicate deliberately with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: "If you encounter several other dogs and notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react on the basis of this experience."
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
The canine behavior expert John Bradshaw, who was invited to the School of Veterinary Sciences at Bristol University, said that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University discovered that dogs were turning their heads to the left when they were looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study carried out by Victoria University in Canada, he said: "The dogs went more easily to a robot dog when his tail turned left rather than right instead of becoming anxious – the reverse of what is in the Italian study."
He noted that the differences could be due to the fact that dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully consider the animals of the movies or the dogs robots as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements, recorded in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs do not make an exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will certainly not take long before we understand why their tail moves sometimes on the one hand and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock group reported a concert in Glasgow after a laryngitis was diagnosed to its singer.
The Sheffield group was supposed to take place on Friday in the The Hydro concert room in the city center.
However, his laryngitis forced the singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to report a concert to the LG Arena of Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys stated: "After deciding to postpone the concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham this evening and after requesting medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys also have to report the show to the Glasgow Hydro on Friday November 1st."
"Alex Turner suffers from a laryngitis and regrets that it cannot occur in concert."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the show at the Hydro in Glasgow will take place on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all the ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope François will nominate his first cardinals in February
Pope François will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest men of the church in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect it, so François will appoint his first group of men who will eventually choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – therefore it returns to a group of 120 "elector cardinals".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting gathering all existing cardinals would take place before the ceremony during which bishops would be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as the constitution.
" Pope François decided to communicate his decision to convene the constitution of February in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero des Voix catholiques said that by February, the number of cardinal electors will probably have decreased.
He said that a pope generally appointed so many cardinals that he needed them so that the number of cardinal electors would reach 120 and so many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wanted.
The composition of next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope François in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a tendency to favour Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of the Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since François formed the council of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world to examine ways to reform the church.
Previously, the pope decided on his own.
"Now François has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "very possible" that François asked for advice to the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is completely new.
Valero said that the popes generally raised bishops representing large communities in the cardinal rank, but that François was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will name”.
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the headquarters file
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to resolve a problem with manually flexible files, according to a statement by the US vehicle safety regulator on Friday.
On some pickups, the previous seats could present a defect at the level of the tilt mechanism.
Consequently, the records do not comply with the federal safety standards of vehicles with respect to head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit by the rear, it may be that the head restraint does not properly protect passengers, thus increasing the risk of injuries", according to the statement on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The models were built between August 1st and September 10th.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the first American car manufacturer since its failure and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of default pickups during the first 15th of October.
NHTSA was unable to examine the owner's information letter due to the end of 16 days of government activities, which slowed the growth of vehicle sales in October.
Silverado and Sierra pickup sales, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% during the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM's stock price rose by 1.4 per cent to $37.47 at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker who died was killed under concrete blocks.
A construction worker died under dozens of concrete blocks, Thursday before noon, in Montreal.
The drama took place about 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie district.
It is likely that work on the foundations has been taking place in this area for some time.
A mythical foundation wall has just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim just arrived on the site in order to recover his tools.
I went by car and saw the wall crawling with a big smoke cloud, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the yard.
I landed and I went to take out the big bricks that would cover it.
We only saw a part of her back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim was an old man in the 50s who worked for a boxing company.
Rehabilitation exercises were tried by emergency services, but without success.
Man didn't survive his serious injuries.
An inspector of the Commission on Health and Safety at Work was deployed to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The cry of despair of a Obama elector
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says Obama has made commendable efforts by the Republican Party's Obstructionism
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of Obamacare site, or drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memory is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a sadly sad book these days.
It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during my 2nd year of medicine and give me hope.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and it is memories of the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama.
When I finished the medical records of my patients in the evening and I was asleep, this book reminds me of the time when politics inspired millions of people and when speeches could cut your breath.
The election ended with a dramatic victory and news reporters took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My friends wept with joy and my parents kept all the papers they found.
A young visionary team headed toward the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During the transitional period of Obama prior to its inception in 2008, it had 82% favourable views.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like getting out of a dream.
It is difficult to recall these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
That had nothing to do with what I imagined.
I put on Obama's credit for great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) to the departure of Iraq from our army, passing through the end of the "neither seen nor known" and the murder of Oussama ben Laden.
In addition, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reform, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after many times defending Obama's administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I'm on the side of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the hearing of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans, or the prosecution of complainants who reveal the government's evils.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, or the avoidance of public finances and the overexpenditure of authorized spending during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the efforts of the White House to reduce media in silence are "more aggressive... since Nixon's administration".
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18 years of age, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the previous political campaigns.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, as the opposition political party and the events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I mentioned above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me most.
I again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and slightly refined alternative that did not seem to allow his policies or his positions to be determined.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being released from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises he had been meant to speak for so long.
However, while the favourable opinion index dropped below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to get back to 2008 through this book.
He makes me wish for the many promises that have been made.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered enormous losses for Clinton's benefit to the Principals of Pennsylvania.
At a post- campaigns meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We must remember who we are.
We are here five years later, Mr President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorbike and a car took place from Retinin Street to Fléron.
The motorcycle, Jonathan, 26 years old, from Fleuron, was not wearing helmets.
Despite the rapid intervention of reliefs, he died at this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the parental leave system.
The billionaire Clive Palmer suggests that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from this system.
The magnitude of the mineral extraction, which contests the payment of a six-million carbon tax, has made this argument valid to try to avoid issues related to a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mineral taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were ready to benefit personally from these policies.
"It will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether she gets leave or not," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer had won the seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 votes, after counting.
Mr. Palmer advanced the idea of a change in the suffrage-discharge system to accelerate the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is completed?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your coordinates in a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 p.m. the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of paper pencils to mark the ballots.
Is it to be able to delete the result if someone disagrees?
Today, having a paper skull seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has examined possible options for the electronic vote and recently published a joint reflection document with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions "very seriously".
Public service is a matter of public service.
"We do not seek reward, except for the reward of history, because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York identified a new species of forest dolphin beyond the northern coasts of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveraux, a scientific mission at the Conservation and Study of Animals and Environment Marines (OCEAMM) Observatory, returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identification of new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of boxing dolphin surprise you?
It's good news, but I'm not surprised.
If in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics will allow us to improve our knowledge of species classification sciences.
Furthermore, it is not possible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to result in the classification or belonging of a species to a kind, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are challenged because of the advances in genetics.
Similarly, two very closely morphologically close species were distinguished by genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
Ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the Pacific forest dolphins and the Atlantic forest whales.
Recent analyses made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this a discovery of importance as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had been known by researchers for a long time, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only present in this place.
Therefore, if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we could have a case of extinction of a species, rather than of a local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered to be threatened or by extinction, depending on the number of individuals on Earth, namely stock, and the possibility of recovery from neighbouring stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new species discovered has come out, its stock has automatically become weaker, thus making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This bridging of genes limits the creation of new species.
On the contrary, the more close ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually produce the creation of new species.
It must be known that the marine environment is the least well-known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, not to know what lives in the Marianes pit, only 11 kilometres from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent in life research on other planets than in marine research, and it's a lot of time to change.
RBS suspends two traders on the exchange market
The Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division according to two sources close to the file, which shows a new time when the global survey of regulators on the suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulation begins to bear its fruit.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they would cooperate with regulators in the most important financial market investigations in the world, where $5.3 billion changes by hand every day.
Both traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended in the context of the extension of the investigation, which has led to the scandal of manipulations of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from regulators.
"The ongoing investigation into this case continues and we fully cooperate with the FCA and the other regulators," said one bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources near the file reported that RBS had sent instant emails and messages sent to and by an old trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his position as European trading officer to the account for JPMorgan's currencies.
Rohan Ramchandani, European Trade Manager at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior foreign exchange officer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, added sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that it had attempted an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said that it was investigating suspicions of market manipulations of change in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the monetary authority of Hong Kong – are examining allegations made concerning bankers that would be heard to manipulate market rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Switzerland also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, reported close sources of the file.
Banks have been leaking instant messages and e-mails sent over the years to find cases of reprehensible acts.
News of these investigations has derailed traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines of investment banks trading units in recent years, but has been challenged this year because of the low volatility of currencies that limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast market of highly liquid changes, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader stated that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to start having a low-cost market impact".
The news came the day when the Swiss Credit announced that a trader working in his office had been negotiating funds at the London Stock Exchange this week after he lost $6M at the end of last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was controlled," said a representative of the Swiss Credit.
The investigation into Major Rob Ford has been carried out, supporting a lawyer
After the police confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Me Clayton Ruby said that he had never seen an investigation "so bad."
Ruby said to believe in the Canadian press that the police had "ignored or minimized" evidence against the mayor.
This Thursday, the police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional driver Alexander Lisi, aged 35, and accused him of exorcising him about the video.
Alexander Lisi, formerly accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police also said that they had observed this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
Me Ruby qualified as "inexplicable" the fact that the police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or listened to his phone, claiming that the chief of police Bill Blair chose to know why not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, would have been very well able to intercept Rob Ford's vehicle, arrest the mayor, and carry out a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an immediate search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police didn't comment, but his spokesperson Mark Pugash described Me Ruby's words as "evident and desperate" to be relied on by the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At a press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair said that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable reasons" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European Stock Exchanges at mid-session, except for London
With the exception of London, the main European Stock Exchanges are going down on Friday at mid-session, culminating in some news from depressing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious because they believe that the US Federal Reserve could denounze its quantitative mitigation policy earlier than planned.
On the contrary, following the announcement of an inflation rate of 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spread among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could simplify its monetary policy.
The future of Wall Street is expected to open up American actions in the wake of two consecutive response sessions.
At the values, Renault (-4.63%) records the largest CAC 40 response, which was the result of his partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, after also publishing low results this morning and announces the creation within a "bad bank" structure of 38 billion books of the most risky assets.
On the other hand, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the head of EuroFirst300 in response to a press release that wants AT&T to study a possible OPA.
On the market for change, speculation on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy is going well, as evidenced by John Hardy, a strategy at Saxo Bank.
The ECB's unique mandate has always been on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at the next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for a drop in the euro.
In this context, the euro continues its rebate against the US currency and has reached a lower two-week meeting of $1.3517.
These same designs support the euro area's mandatory market in turn.
The Supreme Court validates the Obama Health System Reform Act
Great victory for Obama's administration: the U.S. Supreme Court today stated that Obama's health system reform law was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to subscribe to health insurance by 2014, with no obligation to pay a fine – and stated that it was constitutional under the government's taxation authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the Law of 2,700 pages and also considered that the provisions of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that Medicaid's eligibility threshold should be reduced without losing all the federal funding of the programme, was coercive in accordance with the constitution.
The procedure for blocking the law was initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All the major Republican candidates for the high-ranking presidential election during the early 2012 primary elections, including the nominated candidate Mitt Romney, have fiercely opposed the law.
Vibrant respect given to former combatants in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute to the soldiers and the deceased of all wars this Friday afternoon.
Gerbs were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by Mme Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Crossroads between Palestinians and Israelis at the Gaza Strip
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on Thursday, October 31, 2013 at night at a violent siege at the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday, November 1st, after the exhausting of its fuel stocks, the Palestinian enclave Energy Authority announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another frame of the Hamas armed branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a firing squad during an Israeli army invasion east of Khan Younes, south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local leaders of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, found death when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants conducted a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel crossed by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli car and a armored bulldozer made an incursion of a hundred metres within the territory before they left.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In one communiqué, a spokesperson of Hamas, Sami Abu Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heros" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the Heroes of Al-Qassam who fell in defense of the territory during an incursion of the Zionist occupation in Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
"The Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupant," the spokesman threatened.
On the other hand, the Israeli army indicated that the objective of its operation was at the outset a section of a large tunnel crossed into Israeli territory since the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and destined, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, stating that the purpose was to eliminate Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communiqué.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive device aimed at the forces of Tsahal (Israeli army) and injured 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," said Army spokesman Peter Lerner.
In addition, Israel struck a military base in north-west Syria, aiming at a shipment of missiles for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, the Al-Araby satellite channel reported on Thursday, October 31.
A U.S. official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not give details about the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he was pleased to add.
Officials of the Israeli Government refused to confirm any information on such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that it had not named, the Saudi capital chain indicated that "the bombing aimed at a cargo of ground-based missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting rebels alongside the Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, had reported several explosions heard on Wednesday at dawn in an air defence base in Sonar Jablé, near Lattakié, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of militants and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents her two new group choreographies in Dance Dance: Henri Michaux's first inspired poems and poems, the second inflated by the famous piano solos Gymnopedies of Sati.
A evening that allows you to see the whole prism of Chouinard, art to the ticks and black to the white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the vast space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, progresses, profile, finish like a black line and clothing, a body.
On the screen, an encre of Henri Michaux is designed.
The body, simply treats, takes its form.
And this form will be the whole piece: a bunch of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and the face discovered, wait on each side of the game area, hurry when the next graphics appear, the incarnate, emerge by running.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux takes place in solo relays, in a group at the union (a mass that makes solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs its sign.
It is thought of "Gloire du morning", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, placed online at the front stage.
That's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, drums and electric guitars.
Energy is high, speed is always fast.
There will be a crash when Carol Prayer will take refuge under the carpet of dance, to deliver, micro by hand, with no sobriety or restraint, a part of Michal's poem, monocord and monotone in the cry, and will continue dancing.
And the music to be delivered, and the sequence to be resumed.
This sound and energy discharge, long, if possible, ends by swallowing and swallowing.
As well as the regularity of visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - like these hairs that evaporate or these black tissues that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
It is felt that the choreographer, instead of going to the work of Michaux, was forced, with his ticks.
Result: the bodies look flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux's encries, like Gestalt's shapes, open a broader and gibbouful imagination than dance, more porous.
Only the end, negatively, with its dancers huddled with stroboscope light and the white signs in a suddenly black theater, touched the magic.
The audience loved it, the reception was warm.
The Gymnopedies, after the contract, are richer.
The scene is partly gray, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, such as furniture in a abandoned house.
On the piano, dancers relax to play the scores.
Their impatience in music, touching, gives real fragility.
On stage, the couples pass, in loving duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Groupwork, small transitional soles, groups that move, choirs, writing is less binary.
Buffons appear, also family members of Chouinard, with red nose, in very polarized male-female loving parades.
Loves are carnage, fugitives or players.
The gesture, laughter, and the small screams beautifully convey the archaic, grace and laughter of the bodies in the coyote, of the beings that are founded.
But the room takes its real envelope after health.
A clown comes back on stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything is allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes are superpositioned, the cabotine dancers descend among the spectators, glass, smoke, short-circuit, play code of applause, tear the sauce into a highly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness are insinuating, and it is the art of Chouinard here to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are prosecuted for Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of old Nortel patents has launched a wave of court proceedings on Thursday's patents against portable telephone manufacturers, including Google, the company he took to the pot when selling the patents that took place after Nortel's failure.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Northel patents for $4.5 MD, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent violation before the United States Court of Justice in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly held by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that make it possible to display advertising in relation to terms of research on the Internet, have indicated the results of the trial, which is the heart of Google's business.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones operating under Google's Android operating system, which provides a strong competition for Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 M for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, to finally offer 4.4 MD$.
After losing Nortel's patents in front of Rockstar, Google has subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for an amount of $12.5 MD, a partial market based on the Motorola patent library.
"Although it failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, Google has violated and continues to violate the patents," said the trial's findings.
Rockstar claims more damage and interests against Google, as he claims that the violation of Google's patents is halted, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: A Defective Water Heating at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a settlement in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a leak of gas from a defective hot water, reported on Friday night the replacement of the King's prosecutor.
The expert on the spot by the parquet ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a gas accumulation.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is always engaged.
The grandmother was designed by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his companion, was on his side and was burned more slightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on the spot before being taken to the League CHU, she in helicopter, in ambulance," said Mayor José Paulet, who came down to the places.
Traumatized, the grandfather was on the floor at the time of the explosion.
Clean and except, he was able to join the ground floor by the ladder remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the landlord of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were relogged by the president of the CPAS.
The firemen of Andenne and Namur and the Arches police were involved.
The civil protection of Crisnée has stabilized the two buildings.
Egypt requests the first freely elected President to lend an oath
Mohamed Morsi loaned the investment oath, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he lent the investment oath to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding in Hosni Moubarak who was defeated 16 months earlier.
During his investment in the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi has also become the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He swore to the 18 black judges of the Court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to look like an Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to better futures, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his formation as an illegal and hard-pressed organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 hours, local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered before the Court to acclaim the new president and, demarcating from the presidential fasting of the years of Moubarak, the movement was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy to the very frequent streets connected with the city centre to the southern plains.
Considered as the little charismatic "suffering wheel" of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has been considerably strengthened since his victory and his speech on Friday during which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who wanted to finish the work initiated during the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian President Moubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in a blue and red tie suit, addressing the judges present in the drunk room where he lent his oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University where he delivered his investment speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fan who played the national hymne while he was on guard.
Maréchal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
On his arrival, he was welcomed by the song "The People and the Army, Hand in Hand..." enchanted by thousands of people gathered in the university's great amphitheatre.
Founded in 1908 and the former foundation of secular education, Cairo University later became a fan of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, from which the uprising that ended the authoritarian regime of Moubarak last year, and swore to recover the presidential powers of the military council, which replaced the ex-president.
But by accepting to give an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is used, he is inclined to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The shutdown in the United States slowed the car market growth
The 16-day closure of most federal administrations focused on the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showing the figures published by the builders on Friday, five of the main six achieved lower performances than expected.
The three major constructors of Detroit show a two-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
The analysts averaged 15.4 million annual sales and adjusted seasonal variations, but the market was 15.3 million based on Adam Jonas' estimates, an analyst for Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that this slight break is primarily explained by "the government's 'shutdown' and its impact on the consumer's feeling during the first fifteen months."
However, GM reported a progression of nearly 16% of its sales last month to 226 402 vehicles, compared to 211 563 expected by consensus.
The group's four brands have seen their commercial performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, who continues to benefit from, among other things, the success of his pick-up, saw his sales progress from 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194,301.
On his side, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an increase of 11% of its sales to 140 083 vehicles, compared to 143 536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also sell less than consensus, despite increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM won 1.4% at 4:35 GMT while Ford gave 1.1%.
Renault floated in Borse by the warning of Nissan
Renault accuses Friday the strongest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris after his partner Nissan Motor announced a 20% reduction in its annual net profit forecast, reports traders.
Nissan, who had to make such a revision, also announced a change in his direction.
Several traders reported that the Renault action was affected this morning by the "warning".
"It's clearly Nissan's profit warning," says one responsible for trading a Parisian broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of the capital of Nissan and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of the French, according to data from the Nissan website.
Greece: two deaths in a shooting near a neo-Nazi party site
Two people were killed and another was severely injured on Friday night by fire strikes shot by two people who were on board a motorcycle passing by a place of the Neonazi Aube party golden in the West Bank of Athens, we learned from a police source.
The police were currently unable to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that Aubé's men had argued that the victims were guards of their place.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police officers of the anti-terrorist service moved to the central avenue of the Neo Iraklio flag, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident took place a few weeks after the indictment of six golden Aubé MPs, including the party leader and founder, for participation in "a criminal organization" within the framework of an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's call was rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for the next two league league matches of his club champions against Ajax and the Milan AC.
Disfellowshipment against Barça for sending a blow to Neymar, the Scottish environment saw its suspension extended to three UEFA meetings.
In a communiqué, his club was called "very disappointed", believing that his appeal was entirely justified.

The most affected sectors are the Laurentides with 15,042 subscribers to the black, Monterégie with 13,464 and the Outauais with 8642.
The large region of Montréal also knows its lot of breads with nearly 7,000 private electricity houses in the metropolis and Laval.
You think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has reviewed its net increase in profits and hopes for record results through vacationers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency is now expected to make a substantial profit for the entire period between $325 and $340 million before taxes, compared with a previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If current forecasts are achieved, this will represent 12 to 17 per cent of growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million achieved in 2011/12.
The Director General, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre had achieved 8 per cent of the first semester's benefits and that the second semester had begun in force, in particular with regard to travel other than business travel in Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and many of them are in a good way to achieve record results for the whole year before interest and tax deduction," he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually the countries that generate the greatest profits.
In Australia, the leisure sector rebounded during the second half, which allowed compensation for a domestic low business market.
Also in the United Kingdom, the Flight Centre leisure travel sector has recorded good results while business customers have spent less.
Its United States branch recovered its losses during the first half of the year in which the seasonal demand was lower and was expected to benefit the entire year for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre shares increased by 3 cents to reach $38.20 yesterday.
Unknownly located on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Unknown conjured people opened fire this Friday at a hotel near Cairo's pyramids in Egypt, without making victims, as a result of a queer appearance with licensed employees.
The kidnappers took the escape, specified the spokesperson of the Interior Ministry, Police General Abdel Latif.
This attack occurs when Egypt no longer receives any tourist since the army replaced Islamic President Mohamed Morsi in early July and represses in the blood the demonstrations of its supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, orthography and grammar
In English literature courses, students will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, a romantic poem and contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to our day.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage a more diverse reading.
A combined course of English literature and language will be deleted.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and math programs tomorrow – the first materials to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other fundamentals next year.
Furthermore, Offual, the Board of Tests will open up a change in the structure of the GCSEs, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking in the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said there was a "wide consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours per year, 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, and Singapore students make about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to maths, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GCSE of deep maths – as well as the greater importance given to the materials contained in international classifications – would probably encourage schools to provide more class hours.
The programme will focus more on "the problems of the real world", including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that State and that the right to abortion is largely challenged will enter into force.
An octogenary welcomes children with a shot at the Muy for Halloween
The 9 and 13-year-old minors made the door to the door to claim candy on Halloween night.
One of the banks of the Muy neighborhood visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The old man, 86 years of age, explained to the gendarmies he was afraid of.
His weapon was taken.
The former chief of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever finding his mark, was actually buried in a common pit of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the head of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller didn't survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in a common grave of the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte in 1945," he assured the daily high-drawing by relying on archive documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great Enigmes of the Post-War.
The German secret services, the BND, would also ensure that during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
Secret services were completely mistaken.
"Since August 1945, Müller's body has been found in a temporary grave near the former Ministry of the Reich Aviation by a commando," said Mr. Tuchel.
He was wearing "a general uniform."
"In the left inner pocket there were, in particular, its service states with a photo," he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the district district of Mitte in Berlin showing that it was buried in the district's Jewish cemetery.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
One of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery, it is an enormous amount of bad taste.
"A massive crowd of the foot the memory of the victims," he got up in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important personalities of the Third Reich that have never been captured.
He attended the Wansee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and in particular under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost all their weekends seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, only 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN heroes in 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, to elect "Heros CNN of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle looked at his sick father to alter the periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and to go to hospitals that were not equipped to come to his aid.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he would carry the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken her abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in hospitals and hospitals, so that he could get any treatment he could receive.
"It's not easy," adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, drive to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation hasn't changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there are only 1 doctor for 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor for 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health expenditures are carried out in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they can't enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so much of his compatriots suffering, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team have performed over 700 surgical acts for free during the last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital of Yaoundé.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which goes into rural areas during the weekend to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost all Fridays, with 30 people, they get into vans after they have fixed the medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrain to get to the villages that need the most help.
Chances don't always follow them.
They often had to push vehicles to cross rivers or boulevards.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, song and dance and offers them the best accommodation available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with her great smile and her awesome energy – is more than happy to join the holidays.
The next morning, the team began to receive hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people at every visit," said Mr. Bwelle.
Sometimes they live 60 km from the village, and they come walking.
In this traveling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can receive bees, a pair of bees collected or a certificate of free birth – a document required to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the practical team of simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are generally practiced in a school, a matrimonial or house; after intervention, the patient wakes up and goes to the wake room to leave his room for the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the electrical group, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers are working until the first hours of Sunday morning.
It is an exciting rhythm, but the musicians of the villages generally help the team to remain motivated.
"They hit drums all night to keep us awake so that we can keep working," explained Mr. Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 surgical acts for free during the last year, and he knows that their presence can make a whole difference for those to whom they come for help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to care for an inheritance would allow him to work again.
"This will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to living this traveling hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works the night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
This is the second job, he explains, which accounts for 60% of its association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he's asleep," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student in the second year of Dr. Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteering within Dr. Bwelle's group.
He's always at the hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to be able to run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is an opportunity for learning on the ground they do not have at home.
"We have been able to participate in operations to help shed blood or make the instruments go to Dr. Bwelle," Ms. O'Malley explained.
This is not something you have an opportunity to do in America when you are studying medicine in the second year.
Voluntary students generally pay their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with the medical equipment collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their pensions, their transportation and education are taken over by Dr. Bwelle.
"It's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not near to expand.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others to live happily by keeping his promise to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," Mr. Bwelle added.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
To make people laugh and ease pain are the reasons that motivate me to do so.

The two Frances of Pierre Nora
Perplexes, university students have long struggled to define and place Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheatres and classrooms?
No doubt, but by stressing his weakness for the pathways, Science-Po, the Higher Studies.
Arbitrary of other works in his Gaston-Gallimard Street office?
Indeed, but by ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the publisher.
Heavier of the faucet that employs Fontenelle at the French Academy?
Of course, but knowing that such a sacred one could not replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, which happened.
They voluntarily recognized him as a great wake-up, animator and a federate of their work, but noting that he had little tendency to produce it himself.
In this image, the monument of the "Memory Places", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The evil languages were able to see a giant pus market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a vibrating eyebrows and a lousy but incorrigibly delicious.
The two works published by Nora here soon two years have already established that the one who passed without writing had much and well written.
The book here should definitely make him righteous.
However, once again, there is the temptation of obesity, intellectual vagabondization, the jubilation put to jump like a foothold on one subject to the other.
But it is quickly understood that the missing objects gathered in this book so beautifully bring the broccant to a single passion: the discovery of the constituent node of the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: It is a concern of time.
Little by little, we were collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the perennial spirit of our leaders then, French identity was a contemporary essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, compulsory jacobinism, was entrusted to prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The trace Pierre Nora is everything else.
He does not inherit an eternal freedom, he refuses to define it.
An anxious analyst of a family stranger, he errs in a forest of symbols, arrested every step by an object in the form of a rebuff, tortured by annoying questions.
So this one, who is born of the company itself: why, in a country so long-lastingly installed in its borders, so old-fashioned and solidly masqueraded, do we hear these dramatic calls to unity?
They are not so urgent, Pierre Nora suggests, but to conjure up the trouble of the French history.
Francs and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
And the most emblematic is, of course, the one that doubles the national history.
From the Seism of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchy, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but did not get to the kidney; he was concerned about finding the sanctuary, and was so much more greedy of unity and indivisibility that she had cut her head off to the one who was the clear and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincibly binary nation shared between the left and the right, laity and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
In order to feel this singularity of French identity, nothing is worth four steps outside of Hexagon, so that the American escape from Pierre Nora could well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have one revolution and one revolution, a statement of rights, I wanted to set up a new society.
But the American cuisine only makes it better to stress what's clean for us.
There were men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer cared about it.
Here, men covered by an ancient indigenous regime, and even more radical.
There was a consensual revolution when she here planted the drama and confedes it.
There are always respected founding fathers, and here there are revolutionary ancestors who are not worthy of making models, and who have been confused about the rest.
There is an institutional consistency, and here there is a cascade of constitutions, such as errors to catch and attempts to resume.
France who goes, France who comes
There was, however, a time when the French thought they could cut off the clothes they wore from their history, and overcome the curse of the number two.
At this third Republic, central and creative time, Pierre Nora showed great interest and even tenderness: welcoming those who were then used to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolchildren everything that in ancient France had obscurely prepared modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity only had a time.
This is again in the debate, which is fuelled by the immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of claims minorities, absorbed in the European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that goes and the circulatory sketch of France that comes.
With, first of all, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
We found out that the fireplace was a married woman.
The man of multiple curiosity, slightly obsessive, revolved around the same idea.
The ledger was located in the center of the center.
And the one who had filed, this is more than half a century ago, a subject on the idea of the nation, but it was withdrawn from the initial exercise of the thesis, trusts us, with grano salts, that he will end up doing it.
Some in a less rigid, more fragile and subtle form.
But we don't cheat, we don't cheat. It's also binding.
As much more than the figure imposed on the university course, this thesis says the inner need for a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage"
Taken to Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his team "Antenna 2" came to film a Hezbollah event, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in the creation of the Association for the Defence of the Otages of the World, which he has been chairing for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for hostages to complain and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Held more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida at the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grace military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they were able, since, to find their families.
And try, at least, to resume the course of their lives.
"The New Observer" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, former senior reporter, retired since 2008, president of the Association "Otages of the World".
From the evening of your release, you were on the 20th floor of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your liberation today?
On site, for example, in Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it makes black - Roger Auque.
He tells me we're released, but I'm not sure, and you tell me we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but very inclined, too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very inclined.
They put us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive on the site of the hotel Summerland where the press is present.
Frenchmen take us to the Embassy of France.
It's time for the first rounds to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And had dinner in a t-shirt at the Embassy of France.
I also remember a short night discussing with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to escape to Larnaca Airport in Cyprus.
When we arrived there in a helicopter, we took a private plane that takes us to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How did your arrival on the French soil take place?
We're landing in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's kind of brutal.
There's an incredible bouscule.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three television channels.
I'll be back and there's plenty.
The descent of the plane ladder, the encounters with my son and my parents, my friends, all of this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and I, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin is driving.
The bikers take off to take pictures and follow me to my house where I have to do some police to stop some of them from going up.
The media pressure is huge.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is so difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and we're all suddenly under the media lights.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, rather complex to manage.
But we've done the hardest.
The night itself, I'm at 8:00, the next day I'm on TV.
Then start a sort of life-rehabilitation, very slowly, for one or two months that are a bit like vacations.
How have medical examinations and DGSE debriefing been performed?
I was entitled to a first medical check in Corse.
The rest was done in the Val-de-Grace the following days I returned: radios, exams in all kinds and met with a psychiatrist.
It is not a meeting that does everything but we know that we can count on it, remind it if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about hostages.
It was logical.
It didn't fool me.
How do you today react to the release of the four hostages from Niger?
I'm listening to what they say.
The discussion on the budgets, in particular.
Some things upset me, others less.
I try to share the issues between my past as a hostage and my presidential helmet from the Association "Otages of the World" that allows me to make a distance, and I find it much more interesting to approach.
For example, I wonder about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I fight, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the stay.
I think there's a problem with semantics.
The taking of "political" hostages - which is the case most of the time - must be qualified and allow hostages to have access to justice, to bring complaints and to bring their hostages before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is done for that.
Why don't you tell the hostages "you've breached the rules of war, like those of all Geneva conventions, you're going to be brought to justice"?
It seems to me, however, to be founded, legitimized, struck with good sense.
This message is heard, but it's not heard, and I'm shocked.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi's trial
Anger spreads in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of the late President Mohamed Morsi, they went down to the streets.
Mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the first democratically elected president of the country.
This is not a trial that emphasizes this Muslim Brotherhood.
Until now, no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial involving a pro-Morsi, who is supposed to be judged by Sisi, not the contrary.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Faces broke up in Alexandria, the police used tear gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed to the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be judged.
Hagel accuses 9 American States of violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state recognized the homosexual marriage, "all military partners have the right to an identity card from the Department of Defence and the benefits that come with," the Minister in New York recalled in an address to the Anti-Defamation League against anti-Semitism.
"But some States refuse to issue these cards to partners of the same sex in the National Guard facilities" established in their territory, he has denounced those States for violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these persons cannot benefit from many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defence told the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The front of the nine States began by Texas, which refused to implement these benefits on the texane National Guard facilities, due to a conflict between the texane law and the federal law on homosexual marriage.
He joined in his refusal by India, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a high-ranking defence officer.
The Pentagon considers the population concerned by the recognition of homosexual marriage to some 5,600 active persons, including the National Guard, Reserve and Pensions.

At only 10 years of age, he has already won his place this year for the European Championships in Copenhagen, and he likes nothing but to show off to competitors who exceed three heads.
The mayor of Toronto chases journalists who came to ask him about a drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drug abuse, according to several media.
A video released to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested person, Rob Ford, has always refused to consume cracks, while recognizing that he has a pen for cannabis.
This Thursday, he chased several journalists from his property to question him.
We also think that sometimes the images do not need an explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a chat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rage had been detected in a cabin in the Val-d'Oise, manifestly of foreign origin, while France has been free of Aboriginal cases since 2001.
The caton was found in Argentina on 25 October and died on 28 October.
The root diagnosis was confirmed by Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been undertaken to identify and take care of persons who could have contacted this caton between 8 October and 28 October," says the Departments of Health and Agriculture.
"Five people who have been in contact with the caton have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"With man, the preventive treatment of the human race, administered after contact with the animal carrier, but before symptoms appear, is very effective," the communiqué said.
The departments now call on the persons who would have been bitten, arrested, horrified, or lashed on a mucous membrane or skin injured by this cat or whose animal would have been in contact with this cat between 8 and 28 October to contact on 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"Since France has been free of rabies since 2001, this cat or mother has been imported from another country, not free," according to the communiqué.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last case of "autochtone" of the race identified dates back to December 1998, and that "France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rabies on an illegally imported dog from Gambia had been recorded in 2008.
"The anger is a fatal disease if it is not treated in time," the departments recall and is transmissible for nearly 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama Walks Back on His Health System Reform
Under a wave of criticism, President Obama came back yesterday on his unmistakably promise and often repeated that “if you are satisfied with your health regime, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received feedback from their providers, the Republicans criticised the President during the last few days by accusing him of misleading the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The great majority of people with health insurance can keep it," he said at a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "a lack of momentum in the current" about the resolutions, President Obama encouraged Americans who received these opinions to seek new market assurance.
Most people will be able to obtain full and better health schemes at the same price, or even less expensive than expected.
"You'll win," he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprised if the 5 per cent of the population who themselves contracted their insurance were forced to change the regime because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better," said Kathleen Sebelius in his testimony to the Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market in October had failed "poorly".
"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone," she added.
I'm looking forward to getting your trust back.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this phrase, while she believed her micro cut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at the Assembly meeting yesterday following a exchange of views with Billy Long, a Republican representative of Missouri, to know whether she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long has repeatedly asked Ms. Sebelius why "the architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced the government's sponsorship insurance to subscribe to a regime via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel features a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The happy choice, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the concepts of speed and heat at the track level.
German Sebastian Vettel, a four-time Formula 1 World Championship, trained for the free trials of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday a special helmet whose design was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose from among the 1,500 designs sent around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, and its sponsorship.
He was invited to follow Abu Dhabi's GP, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was to carry this helmet on Friday and Saturday, to the tests.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, intended to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his party of the banlieue
We don't cheat especially.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, his founder, the "Parti de la banlieue" is not only addressed to the banlieuards.
I've chosen a map of France as a logo, he'll justify it.
When I speak of banlieu, I address all those who are excluded from the great national family.
He did not prevent his project, presented on Thursday in press conference in his native community of Aubervilliers, from being born with the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural pot melting that characterizes all neighborhoods.
My proposal No.1 is to create a department of multiculturalism, please indicate.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years old, territorially attached, today claims to be "100% apolitic" even though it has not always been neutral.
Military in 2002 near Jean-Pierre Chevnement, he then locally supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I propose in my programme are linked to the left, but if the right-wing people are willing to support me, I will listen to them, too.
There are only extremist parties I'm not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built its program - consulting on the Internet - from many topics to talk to the people of banlieu and, in particular, to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years of age, the rehabilitation of the function of the building guard...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend their ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, this may be fair, he recognizes."
It's a time and money problem.
The Banley Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I also hope in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune ensures that there are already seven lists in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the letters of support I have received since yesterday don't all come out of banlieu" he rejoiced.
John Kerry admitted, without precedent, that American espionage "was too far away in an inappropriate way"
John Kerry indicated a reduction in the United States' defence attitude towards his surveillance programs, admitting that, on several occasions, espionage "was too far away in an inappropriate way".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, was governed by "automatic pilot" when a series of fire revelations by denouncing Edward Snowden about NSA espionage activities was observed.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr. Kerry said: "It is unthinkable that the President, myself and other members of the government have become aware of certain things in an automatic pilot mode because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War to the difficult years of the Cold War, then of course on September 11th."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had exceeded the limits, but insisted that the rights of everyone had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it has gone too far in an inappropriate way."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to the people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one will be mistaken.
I assure you that innocent people will not be victims of abuse in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force for good and that its monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We live in a new world where people are ready to jump."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, make them explode and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have been good and well prevented from falling planes, explosive buildings and people being killed because we were able to get to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will go to Europe to respond to concerns about the alleged American espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, the Senate's subcommittee on European affairs explained on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut stated that he had spoken before the members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had posed regarding the possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations because of the frustration of the National Security Agency's monitoring.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain on our side in the mutual commitment to combating terrorism," said Murphy, a democrat serving his first mandate, and president of the European Senate Sub-Commission on Affairs, during an interview since Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue working together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by NSA programs.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has disrupted relations with some US allies, but the Agency's director said this week that it was incorrect and that it was a misunderstanding because it was related to the metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations reported documents published by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the German chancellor Angela Merkel and those from 34 other heads of state.
The Information Services Director, James Clapper, justified the spying of the allies by stating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this stormy atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a trip to Congress, which should take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would understand members of both parties and the two chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators should be disclosed in the coming days.
He indicated that the itinerary remained to be defined.
Murphy said that the purpose of this trip was to improve relations, but also to prove "closed in affection".
He explained that the Heads of State of Europe should be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programs they have been applying themselves for years.
"We can change our surveillance programs to better protect Europeans' rights, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world to spy out," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry planned to go this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the encounter generated by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by United States surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, culminated in Shell's bad results and on the following day of a announcement by the Fed of maintenance in the state of its support for the economy, as planned.
An Australian calls for his prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old resident of Sydney, sentenced to 15 days imprisonment in Phuket for claiming to have been abused by a taxi driver, appealed to the trial and was released under bail.
Steve Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Province Court on 15 June of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled it, attacked him earlier on Sunday 10 June.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after separation from her little Australian friend.
Phuket's police interrogated Bamford for two days before she could have invented the story of all the pieces.
She was detained in a local commissioner's cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days imprisonment in a low-security detention centre in the Phuket area rather than in a prison for women.
This is the daughter of the former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who called the Department of Foreign Affairs of Canberra to help her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to come to Australia.
"We have obviously lived a distressing moment, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed for judgment and was released after payment of a deposit of 50,000 bahts.
In Australia, the press stated that while waiting, it was on vacation in the Krabi region, south of Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer from Phuket, but they predicted that the appeal could lead to an extension of the sentence that could go up to two years in prison and an incarceration in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to reduce its deterioration of the image of tourists, which could lead to a performance.
The French police will arrest Anderlecht's supporters other than the RSCA cars.
The French police decided to lay down strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club d'Anderlecht against the Paris Saint-Germain fixed Tuesday, reported Marie Verbeke, the spokesman for the Brussels-midi police area on Friday.
Belgian RSCA supporters who want to go to this meeting of the Champions League will have to use the RSCA-based displacement system.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former Rekem border post to the PSG stage," the spokesman said.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters intended to go to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture indicated that measures had been taken to allow arrests or to be carried out by guards," Marie Verbeke said.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Committee
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Committee, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
That is what motivated, one year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and members of education staff to reflect on ways to better integrate students who live on horseback among many cultures.
The School Committee has just revealed its vision of "Living Together in French".
The Vision of Diversity organization has been walking in schools for one year to help students of all origins discover common references that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they're from scratch or they're from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
"Then, projects are created so that they can identify themselves to all of this," explains the President of Vision diversity, Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne, from the New World Institute, identified several challenges for the school commission.
"On transmission, for example, of what is Quebec culture, the feeling of belonging, the support for staff in the transformations that we live in the student clientele," he said.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Committee has set up a research centre that will provide teachers with tools that sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, of the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
The preparation to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"Various educational strategies, that's the real need," she sums up.
Research will focus on inclusion in all its angles: language, school, social and cultural.
