Two drivers between the two points and the course and the conversation between them are said to be traffic flows.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to challenge the speed of the journey because the driver's speed is definitely never fully understood.
Fortunately, drivers have a tendency to move within a given series of systems, and this way the transport system can also be presented mathematically in a reasonable format.
