I want to be a coward.
You're going to school.
Do you mind?
Are you all right?
It's all in the wind.
I'm staying here.
I saw a spree in the zoo.
A thousand years ago.
Do you want to go?
Look, a seed of Abelia.
I want this thing done, Tom.
I'm pretty big.
And because of it, it's deep.
I was dressed like a girl.
Are you all right?
I don't need any kind.
I lost my soul.
I haven't forgotten.
Where are you going, Galleg?
I want a guitar.
What are you doing?
You're welcome.
I know Tom's fine.
The list is up to date.
Are you here?
She was a slow girl.
It's dark.
My book is on your desk.
Tell me what you want me to get.
It's in private.
I don't know, Tom, Mary was familiar with the French language.
You!
Look, it's an aphrodisiac tree.
The letter has not been written yet.
Repeated out of all of their replies to mails.
The spell's gone.
I'm glad to hear that.
It can't be.
This isn't a phrase.
Tell me what you want me to get.
Can I get a little bit of a waiter?
Lous and I'll hear it.
Is it white?
You got a car?
A thousand pals.
Your dad doesn't want to go in his father's direction.
He's good-looking.
Welcome to Tatoeba!
Tom was talking.
Do you have a car?
Thank you.
I've lost my wish.
It's a fruity fruit.
What's your address?
Who took all the cookies?
Don't wait.
Do you like the black man?
It wasn't a mistake.
Don't talk to me!
Naf, it's cool.
He was the first guy.
They're making fun of us.
I'm so sorry.
He was dressed like a girl.
Does he still have a head?
Watch out!
He's got his head inside.
I wasn't one of them.
Don't leave me alone.
I won't.
I've been killed for money on either side.
An external language study is available.
Tom's a good friend of mine.
Tom preached.
You've got a fight under the table.
He owes us one.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday is the seventh day of the week.
Are you jealous?
I'm not leaving alone.
Give me the whole, please.
More coffee, please.
He was the first guy.
Thank you!
People were on Sundays.
I'll get you a good chance.
Tom's gone into his quarantine with a nice friend of his
NaF, it's so cool.
Me, I don't need anything.
Nightfall!
Look, a Japanese fried fruit!
I understand.
Shut up.
I know what you're talking about.
Good night.
Please answer.
I swear to God, Tom.
It's Tom.
I've seen this before.
Khalifa Castle is the world's highest skyscraper today.
Are you going to die?
I can't wait.
Do you want to give me the whole thing?
I don't have a wallet.
Tom was singing.
You don't have to get one.
I worked alone.
Send the doorman with you.
Where is the room?
Did Tom give it to me?
I'm sick of it.
It's a gift from Wagdalena.
This car's mine.
I'm gonna go.
There are many people on the table.
Look, it's an asteroid tree.
The French language is empty.
I want this thing.
They're still missing.
I want you to live with Getter Jaani.
That's great if he's gonna die of his dad.
Good night, Yukina.
It's not a joke.
There's a lot of shit in Brazil.
The language is black.
You're sure he is.
He sang a song.
Over there.
I'm sorry.
Thank you!
The language is not white.
Look, there's a tree here.
Dad wasn't home.
It's all right.
Opened for the north end of the car area
You can't come here.
I need a call.
He's in Tokyo.
You don't want Tom to be a treasurer like his father.
I got it.
You lost it again.
I've seen Tom do this.
He was a big man.
I've got a built-in pen.
I like it.
Tom would have called the police if he wanted him.
It's just a circus.
People are going home.
I'll keep going.
A guitar I'd like to get.
Filter fills my browser
Are you kidding me?
Watch out!
I'm sure I've done something like this any time.
Look at a red canvas.
I got it.
Sunglasses make a lot of noise when they're painting.
Tom's the only one who's got what's really happened.
Thank you very much.
Look, it's an affidavit.
Did you win?
I'm going to miss before I'm almost done.
Are you there?
Is that how it works?
A strong gel is waiting.
I live in Japan.
I'm not special.
Naf!
When were you born?
Tom's playing rugby.
Sunday's the last day of the week.
I'll hold on.
It's not my turn.
Look, it's a pink bear.
How long is this clock?
The language is white.
I'm crying.
I've got questions to ask you yet.
My friend's doing things together.
It wasn't for me.
It's late.
I saw him running.
That's great.
Tom wasn't in contact with Mary and John.
I understand and I'll be fine.
It's cold.
The work of the rin will go one.
I love her.
It's Tom Rugby's game.
Thank you very much.
I see something.
Tom is in charge of making people do things for him.
Tom wins.
Tom's got a good idea.
It's the bartender's fault!
I'm better off.
I gotta go.
Who's that?
Thank you.
White bar, please.
There's a box under the table.
It wasn't the size of this thing, was it?
Is that it?
It's nice to meet you.
Tom suffocated.
Think about it.
You're sure he is.
I don't like it.
I'm not working.
I'm done.
This movie was nice to Dom and Vari both.
I don't speak Spanish.
I'm done with the whole thing. Please give it to me.
I've got a pain in me.
Do you want to do it?
Yes.
That's the point.
Only a few of them are as good as a pimp.
He's got a brain in him.
I need to finish my appointments
Did something wrong happen?
How are you?
I'm staying here.
Can you get AIDS against privacy issues?
I'd like to have something.
Where's the problem?
My legs are dead.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
You got the money?
I'm not gonna do that.
They're not listening.
I heard you.
Tom's gone?
There's only one language that's not enough.
Have you ever been to Paris?
Tell me what you want.
Enclasses on.
I've seen a little bit of a thing.
Call the police.
I don't think so.
It's just games.
Tom didn't think Mary was talking to him.
I've lost my mind.
Tom liked to understand nomads.
I don't speak Japanese.
Just listen to me.
I know I'm sick.
The French language is empty.
Where's Galleg's talk?
Too many wearable coats
He's got one.
I'm thinking about it.
You've been playing around for a while.
Thanks, Yukina.
Are you a guarizius?
It was last time.
Ask for Paris.
I've come to fight.
You better keep going.
There was an error displaying help.
I've lost my mind.
Thank you, my brother-in-law.
Where do you think you're going to pray?
He's here with me!
Are you sure?
I heard him coming out.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That's so cool.
One beer, please!
You've got everything.
Who's this guy?
It's a two-way trip.
Look, there's a nearby tree.
Do you have two computers?
I'm a kid.
The art's gonna be great.
I don't care.
The king was jealous and he was obvious.
Do you speak Japanese?
I'm trying to figure out English.
Are you jealous?
I don't know.
That's not a big mistake.
That's not a big mistake.
I'm not working.
Oh, my God.
I know Tom well.
Have you ever been to Paris?
I didn't take any pills.
I'm one of them working.
NaF, what?
I haven't heard.
Are you out of your mind?
Does it cost you a piece of money?
I'm not tired.
Thank you!
I didn't take any cuts.
I'm gonna take care of you.
Have you seen a big link?
Tom is not a student, he's one of the founders.
I can't go home any more and I'll go back.
Look, it's an adenium.
That's the guy.
Look, there's a report.
How long has this clock been running?
Being soft has at least a good quality - you wait for a lot to fail.
Do you want some coffee?
I've had a fall.
She was a man of sorts.
Few of them have been like lunatics.
Where are you talking to Galleg?
There's a language that's known for the money.
The friend's doing things together.
Stay home.
I'd like to see you go nuts.
I'd rather die than be single.
I owe it to you.
NaF, it's so cool.
I'll take care of it.
That's not a phrase.
Good night!
The car's blue.
He's got a song.
Look, it's a true story.
Thank you!
It's great and great.
I'm not waiting.
She's reading it.
There's two pages.
Thank you, Yukina.
He was such a guy.
You're making a head in a cannon.
There's no reason to be spontaneous.
How about Tom?
I remember this thing.
Get out of here right now.
One more cup of coffee, please.
I'm just getting along with them.
Yes.
No, thank you.
And Tom's here?
Tell me what you want to get.
I'm sure you haven't spoken to me.
I see something.
This phrase is not a fairy tale.
The car's blue.
Go one and work.
"What time is it?" "It's half an hour."
It didn't hurt.
Tom was saving.
I don't know.
I need one more.
What do you want?
It's gonna rain.
He was a big guy.
Aonic is Tom.
How much is this sign?
I'd like that.
Do you like it?
Where did it come from?
There's more to it than that.
They didn't knock.
He needs his friends.
Who gave you all the cookies?
He was a cop.
Go to college well.
Khalifa Castle is the world's highest skyscraper.
Tom's gone.
Enclasses on-me.
Rugby's playing Tom.
I know you won't be called.
It's amazing.
It's too late today.
He was a black man.
It's too far away.
I thought Tom was dead.
Did Tom give it to me?
You're welcome to Tatoeba.
Thank you!
I'm turning what I want!
That's the paour-du.
It's okay.
Look, it's a different tree.
I'll try harder.
