There's a big return to the Czech smoldering.
Pavel French was invited to NHL
Czech hockey farmer Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, returns to NHL.
A 40-year-old stepmother will be at the midwife's and she could get to the market soon.
The former Lithuanian, Plzno or Russian Čeljabinsk farmer was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
Right in the middle of a fight with Vegas, and since then, he hasn't been present in NHL locks yet.
The incident occurred at a time when the experienced farmer moved from one point to another.
"The Pope of France will be injured in the lower part of the body in about three to four weeks," the whole of Denver announced in early October.
His return to the branch in NHL was finally extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning, he was called from a farm where he picked up four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, it accounted for 94.5% of the progress.
The pulsary hockey kidnapper finally wants to be planted and confirmed that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In the last year, he had problems with his jaws and in the short-term pandemic year he didn't get a single stroke.
In the NHL 'Francík', 36 matches were fired, with a rate of 92,3 %.
Charles, on Christmas wish, has Camille the bride, William and Kate set up in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate as this year's Christmas wish chose a family photo taken on their trip to Jordan.
He also published his wishes to Prince Charles, who used the photograph on which Camille's cots help to plant the pot.
The British BBC news station reported on its website.
They send their wishes to their friends, their collaborators and the hopes they cooperate with.
Photographs were produced in a desert area.
The duke of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaka color and dresses has Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing as much as Prince George and Louis shorts and a shirt with a scarf.
Who ordered the photograph, William and Kate didn't take it, it's not even clear when exactly it came up.
Last year the royal family for the photo intended as the Christmas wish invited the package of straw before a pile of wood in its rural settlement in Norfolk County.
A picture that serves as a Christmas wish was also published by Prince Charles and his wife, Camillo.
Photographer Sam Hussein caught him in June on his arrival in Ascot.
Charles, who has a cylindrical head and the face of a pig, helps Camille put her chicken in a colourful suit.
Slavia according to efotbal.cz promised Berbro a million for title, the fortress denied it.
Prague – Criminals in the current corruption case reportedly worked with the fact that the accused former Mayor of the Czech Football Association Roman Berbr had from Prague had a promised million crowns for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the efotbal.cz server about it by getting to the part of the police records.
The chairman of the board of the Jaroslav Tvrdík Supreme Club stated that no corruption was permitted in June.
The server published a rewriting of police replies, in which her former sports director Jan Nezmar, from Slavia, who finished his summer in the championship club.
Another influential red-headed official was in frequent contact with both Berbre and former sports director at the time of the second-class Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also in charge of the accused.
The criminals reportedly worked with the information that Slavia Berbro promised her a financial reward when she received a title.
2019 team SK Slavia Prague won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that, for a game in the league, Roman (Berbr) had a promised millions of payments from SK Slavia Praha officials, quoted the server from the list.
Later, according to criminals, Berbr met with Nezmar not only, but also with the chairman of the administration of Slavia Durdík.
According to the server, it is no longer the case that the police are still dealing with this information.
The plaintiff refused any corrupt conduct.
In 2015 to 2017 we actively sought to change the dimensions of Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never been allowed to engage in illegal proceedings, have not tried to influence the decision-makers in opposition to fair play rules, and have not given anyone any financial performance in this regard," the Reportlist said.
In sending, among other things, Nezmar does not selectively insult some former players to the glory of darkness, and he also speaks of his former chief Durdík.
The cause of the alleged impact of the fights through the decision-makers broke up in mid-October police raids on several places including the Prague seat FAČR.
The biggest thing in the affair is Berbr, which no longer exists in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, the same as the former sports director of Vyšehradu Rogoz was released from the bond.
The helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold wars.
They'll be doing new, but in principle worse type (the shooters have to wear the straps manually without covering).
Car - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various tankers - at a decent level, in addition, Prague V3S has managed to get rid of it even with specialized units.
Aeroplanes: combat- obedient, but at the end of the rental, transport - very small with a short but modern flow.
Drony - few and only small types without combat potential
rockets - we don't have any (but we manufacture and export abroad)
PVO: medium-sized, old-age; short-term - good, modern, relatively good number.
I've got stories like that.
I've got Honitbu right next to the city.
They went through the river and did damage to the crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw that on the other side of the river there was a fisherman.
I didn't want to do a brothel, so I sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before something went out, but of course the fox went in a minute.
I let her get to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost fucked up, had his head on all sides, so I called him that it was on the shelf.
Before I got off the property, it was a fire.
Mr. and the loca man is a prussiar.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a conspiracy of a lot of chance to happen, you'd probably be seeing in a thermovise that's almost everybody's got today.
So, in a visible place, dear things go to the back of your legs and you should be okay.
The armies of the Versus Hamaček.
Intro found mirrors significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for buying and distributing chickens, masks and fans for the profession closest to coronavir, has issued billions of crowns on their devices in the past weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during one day the amounts on the mirror varied by hundreds of crowns.
Why did the prices move so dramatically?
Which offices were treated economically?
And why did others buy the garage?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to the editor of iRozhlas Dominik Kubišt.
Soldiers and armies are weighed (I am not affected by the memories of the ČSLA, who have betrayed the older generation), but the Czech cannot benefit from the compulsory war.
We don't even have a large stock of techniques that the training can get, we don't actually have modern technology or for current professionals, and modern technology is getting more and more complicated, so depositors' skills will lose quickly in time.
To that modern conventional conflict, where someone can plant it, they'll play very fast, they won't be time for someone to practice again.
Finally, depositors/territorial defences have a great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where we are going to lead the mass gerilla and this is also a statement of the need to deter the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will take place only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity where the girl will be irrelevant, and we have no proper geography.
Mostly we don't have an individual skill.
It's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them play as if they had it.
Then put in a situation like that, you look at a guy who doesn't hit the empty gate two minutes ago, he's going to attack himself between two or even three shifts, and you're like, "Tvl and what do you think's going to happen now?"
Well, of course they'll choose him as the average taxpayer.
This situation with this "behave a defender" is so terrible that I agreed that I was honestly surprised to see that our attacker managed to win one of the players.
First own funds
The Covid pandemic slows down, but experts for the following weeks don't expect any major return.
Efforts in hospitals according to statistical models will last for some time and have reached the Pandemic equation, as we know, a new unknown: the variant of micron, which is much more likely to spread than is currently ruling Delta.
At the same time, with absolute certainty, it is not possible to say whether it can cause a more serious course of action, as much as it helps to treat or treat post-infectious immunity caused by previous disease treatment.
But this week also entered an unexpected phenomenon on the side of the plus: treatment possibility.
A new antivirotikum molnupiravir has been introduced in Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalisation of a third party and is capable of being treated at home.
And soon it should also be added to paxlovid from Pfizer, which from today's results is even 85 percent success.
The first deliveries of molnupyravira to Česka, however, apart from the hope of extending the portfolio of tools useful in fighting the coronavir pandemic, also raised the question of how the administration is prepared for the future of the medicine.
As it has been said, the first to receive molnupiravir from Merck will be given to foreign patients.
The company ended up in the band as the first one because the medicine began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find appropriate treatment for viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
In this research, people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.) are often reminded of this.
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
That's why Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to speaking "how our teeth grew".
See, you do research where people ask if they like Muslims.
In Czech, most people don't tell you that they don't.
In the West, they'll tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist shit.
And then they go and choose sides like AFD.
They're afraid of canceling culture, saying this to the public means losing their jobs and media links.
Then it looks nice in the research, west good, east bad.
But he'll really find out what people think.
It is only in France Le Penová and Zemmoura, both of which have a survey of more than 20%.
We even know that the objects are identical to the Czech three.
Identical for the purpose of unit rotation, so that soldiers don't have to learn where they are again, so all objects on the bench are the same.
One of them is the Atom Museum of Brdy and the rest of the two are abandoned.
The joke is that the ssr didn't want to have a nuclear head in its own territory either for the sake of safety or for the speed of putting the heads in a more western position.
In these subterranean roofs (there are two in each apple) only the heads were preserved, not all the rockets as they are called.
If there was a need to install this weapon, a special unit came up that picked up this head and mounted it on some portable device.
Besides the museum apple, they're still in a state of desolation.
At the second level of elementary school, we had a partner of Cighan, and we were with him for four years.
He was all right, he made good jokes, often when he showed up too much, but it was our mascot.
He was dealing with him, he often walked and wanted to explain something, he was missing a little, he walked regularly, he was involved in sports with us, he didn't steal candles, or phone calls, he was walking clean clothes.
He drove to schools in the countryside, made a variety of opiates, but he was fine, maybe there was never any gap.
In the eighth or ninth grade, congenital, gypsum to the same year, other classes.
In short, they lost their teacher, and the police often solved something there, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something on an ad (old stuff, something I don't need etc) and I've sold to the Cigans often, the money they always had, didn't try to pull me into the price, communication in peace.
I even sold the car, the guy called in a month ago that he already rewritten it to himself.
I'm saying to myself that I'm not a racist, I don't care if someone's white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave in a decent society (working, working, women don't beat, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, he pulls his hand, he builds apartments and houses, he's just in trouble, he's making trouble, he's kind of like his color, but I'm gonna care.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start business, work, learn language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my tradition and culture, I'll be here as well.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prague
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, unfortunately, despite the resurgence of her injuries on the spot," said Law spokesperson for Jutchen health rescuers Zuzana Fajtlová.
He probably blamed the driver who drove the girl.
Eighteen-year-old vehicle driver Peugeot probably drove in the direction of the village of Zíchovec to the neighborhood of Bavrov and from undetected reasons he drove in the direction of the opposite direction.
After the crash, Škodou Octavia finished the Peugeot vehicle on the roof outside the vehicle, described the accident of the Yugoslav police spokesman Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young Peugat driver suffered a very serious injury during the accident.
It was a multiple injury and it was locked in the car.
After his release, he had to be provided with acute pre-patient care and in a stable condition he was transported by plane to a Czech Buddhist hospital, found to be the savior of Fajtlová.
She added that a man from the second car suffered a slight chest injury and was transferred to the hospital.
For packages from countries outside the EU, new rules apply, customers often do not provide data
Lucas Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He's getting his pick-up cards.
"It can usually be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars higher where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free," the collector approaches.
Since October, he has had a slight delay in ordering small consignments, has to add VAT again and then forward the data to the customs office.
He'll have an e-mail message that the customs officers are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then it is sufficient to complete the data on the consignment, and if VAT has not included the trader when selling, the customs office shall measure it from the total amount for the consignment and for the transport.
Where the addressee does not ensure the customs procedure itself, the total amount must also be added to the carrier's remuneration.
According to Lucas Neuheisla, the whole process is not complicated.
I'm gonna call one or two suspensions, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's a five-minute question, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments can be delivered at a smooth time.
Due to the new customs rules, he dropped in international mail in Prague daily the number of consignments received from abroad from 60 thousand to 15,000.
Moreover, according to the Czech Post, the problem is that people do not respond to the calls for data to be supplied necessary to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30,000 shipments to international mails that we need to process.
If people were to fill out all the data they need and to fill it in time, we would be about half here, the Czech postal speaker Matyás Vitík tells us.
Inflation solution
See the title, how would you propose solutions to current inflation?
We are currently 9.9% of inflation and expect further growth.
What do you think should be done to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We need to see in Poland a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think happens to what's inevitable about where it's going to go?
Prices are rising faster than payments, I believe it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford normal things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who is the employee)?
I have been added 2% in the rough this year, which is a joke, but fortunately, I have a similar income from the business that I work in.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why the demonstrative testimony of violent people is being sent to the network for only six months?
This head just doesn't take me away from how the court can only send a six-month-old animal out of the net just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relations and relationships in general.
And don't talk about the victim of rape ever having to remember.
Isn't this even a potential future report of victim rape?
A man from the grave "lost" his friend from Costomlat
A man from the tomb reluctantly helped the guards to secure his nationwide looking for a friend from Kostomlat, on whom a warrant was issued for arrest.
He called them to him himself.
But he's on the lookout.
First, he spoke to the coroner and made up his story that he was stolen.
After the press call, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged "stealed" told them that he had made up his mind to get the officers to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officials on how to notify the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a state search, and a warrant was issued to her to be arrested.
That's why the case solves the PRC.
An honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slovenian?
I personally believe that we are no longer ethnically or culturally, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with me, of course, that it is a shame that Churchill has failed to ensure the release of Prague USA :')
Of course I don't deny that we have a Slovenian language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not personally consider such a case to be true faith.
Here with Pascal I can't agree, there's a gap in the world if I don't get confused, something around ten thousand different religions.
Which god or god would you choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in some of those thousands of religions there is at least one God who will not punish you if you believe in another god.
Even in the wilderness there is no God but Jehovah.
Would it not, then, be more rational to hold faith in any god than to risk choosing wrong from those thousands of gods and the one true god I just didn't punish, send me to hell or somewhere like that?
Other: Voluntary training with the following classification in reserve.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months per one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If a person does well, he can get a professional offer.
All ACHR files would be like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can say this: There is a constant preference for cooperation between the education sector and industry, for companies hunting in schools, and for some kind of procrastination, when the workforce migrates from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only when we're growing up, but this process is going on all the time, each of us is constantly learning something new, going from one field to another.
Similar proliferation should also work between the civil and military sectors.
I also see it as a way of building a relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that Russia, Germany, or possibly the Mongolian rider will never break up here again.
I find it funny as you think NATO is a stone-pressed thing, and we have allies, and you will defend us if there's a breach.
Well, you're happy.
There's only one election in the United States that will crush their budget and the whole NATO goes to shit.
The English exchange us for Russian money, the Germans exchange us for Russian gas, and the Polish have once again shown themselves enough to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that works for a long time as a guarantee of independence is an armed army and a population that can control military technology of its own time.
And today he can fly the far-controlled means of every teenager, so it doesn't work.
We don't need a border fence, it's bullshit today, but a saved teenager behind a narrow remote controlled device will be able to handle it.
How to avoid falling into boxing sounds
Would you clear the gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're at home packing boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is again used by e-shops that missing packaging materials.
This is why a map of the shops that your used boxes welcome.
And it's not just about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
That's why it's a shame to treat them like a one-time waste.
Anyone may, after agreement, bring into the involved store (KAMsNIM.cz project directory contains 150) cartons, plastics or paper in full.
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overloaded blue containers.
The individual shops welcome packages that are currently on the market and also saved money, as the last-period packaging card has saved 50 %.
In the eyes of environmentally minded customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One of these is TIERRA VERDE, an eco-drug manufacturer and an eco-cosmetician.
However, the boxes and filling materials we have in Poprovek at Brno are carried by individuals who gather at home, and we are also invited by companies with which we have scheduled regular ties of delayed cartons.
We're gonna use everything when we're packing the shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we create a more careful world together.
Our desire is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature to another generation, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
The application www.KAMsNIM.cz, however, shows not only the pick-up places for coastal materials.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to remove sorted waste from the household, where to deliver past medicines, tires, exhausts, batteries, light sources, large-scale waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end in the right place, as well as reusable things will find their second home.
The entire project map already contains over 100,000 such sites.
“There are gradually collecting halls, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPYs and other places that help to find uses for things that would otherwise become unnecessary” adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the Clean Czech Republic application.
I'm going to feel worse that today's technology is so simple and stupid that kids using a computer or a phone play on it, but they don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently, the problem (mainly in English articles) was that students in high schools do not understand the principle of computer content.
Because Google Photos or Apple applications on photos or actually mobile phones generally simply hide this underlying file system with files and everything is found on one screen in the application.
Let them use the technology from childhood, but especially learn something.
Let's rewrite history, really.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency – starting in January – before the weekend, and it was great.
Macron spoke over the hour during which he opened the presidency's logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many actions that they would not be reached in half a year.
French politicians like that, but they like it and they like voters.
Macron supporters of the right-to-left gap agree on a small scale, but just on Europe.
And in France, they'll be in April of a new election to the state's head.
The election calendar also influenced priorities.
The French leader, among other things, mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is prepared to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators have immediately come up with criticism that Macron is about pro-European propaganda and rewrites history.
In fact, he's trying to defend history rather than rewriting it.
The far-right candidate for French President Éric Zemmmour now surrounds France with the view that the regime of Vicha, which worked with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and it is quite successful with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of one of the textbooks seriously and let's not look at what happened in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries learn history as a story of us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs find out who beat him in a battle.
But if they don't have a bright office, they don't know what the broader context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech Mouse didn't win.
The story that returns to the massacre in September 1995 was also rated by the regime and by the best actress Jasnu Duričić.
This year's Karlovary Festival was held at the first corners of the show.
The best actor in Berlin became Anthony Hopkins for the movie Father.
I'm not too young, I'm not too healthy/fit and I'm not sick.
It was cca like "to have a flu/to be hit" for a few days I had a break and didn't have much taste to smoke...
It was worse than the usual flu.
I don't have a break at the flu.
(Only personal experience. I don't think that's what everybody has.)
Christmas Booktypes
The Christmas double number, which will expire on 20 December, will contain a traditional literary annex.
And they're going to have cultural tips with her.
We add these books to this digital edition for you, prepaid customers, so that you may have enough time to arrange books as Christmas gifts.
Prozaic texts that refer to the previous similar collection Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another portion of the world's observation and description of all things with all sorts of poetic sensitivity, depth and atmosphere.
In his second release, photographer Sixtak tried to capture the essence of small town and Czech society.
A report on the return to the roots, which can only be extracted from the illusion.
The Bohemian and comparator conveys the story of the Red Carcule into the sphere of the present village.
Its use of brutality overcomes the people's version and builds up a horror of emotional voids.
And the fact that the way back to the instincts is shorter than a person's willingness to admit
The author in his last novel will report a much less sentimental story about the return from emigration than we used to listen to.
Those who are left, and those who have left, know too little of themselves to spend their lives together.
Trains start driving according to the new driving order, change the transporter somewhere
From Sunday they start driving trains on the train according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of transporters on some tracks, for example between Ústí nad Lab and Kolín, where the place of the Czech Dragons begins to drive RegioJet.
For most lines, only the departure time, if any, will be adjusted slightly and their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the rails.
The transporters started selling the trucks in the autumn.
The Czech routes plan to operate on a daily basis in the new driving order of 6783 passenger connections, from which it will be on a daily basis of 478 distance trains.
Trains will be driven in the new order of approximately 118 million kilometers.
Roads along national connections under the new driving order will also drive to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, along with a new driving order, sets up dozens of new trains.
The main news will be InterJet trains that will drive on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Another new trains of the carrier will travel to the north of Moravia or to the west of the Czech Republic.
The carrier will also traditionally increase the fare prices since next year, an average of 3.2 per cent.
The routes take into account inflation in their tariffs each year.
The biggest change in the region's driving order is the entry on the R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburg – Kolín.
The carrier here, after success in the Ministry of Transport competition, will replace the Czech Railways.
Every day, RegioJet will make 16 connections, eight in each direction.
Further changes relate to remote connections between Prague and Brno, which will also be stopped from Sunday at the stations of Havlíčków Brod, Žjeár nad Sázavo and Kolín.
Leo Express maintained its 16 connections, two back connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakov.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlarík, the carrier also tried to maintain the most similar driving times of its remote trains in the planned exit work.
Without major changes, the operation of the trains of Arriva and other carriers should continue.
The carrier shall also be exchanged in some regional routes.
For example, the changes are waiting for passengers in the Českolipsk, where on the route from Mladen Boleslavi through the Czech Lip to Rumburk will be the place of Czech Dragons to drive the trains Trilex German company Die Länderbahn.
Travelers will also be able to use the same train rides in the second year.
Like the Czech Dragons, their price increases by 3.2 percent.
I don't have to agree.
Aren't we learning the other side's view?
We everywhere hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to fight, died.
In my life, I haven't heard from the employee's side or from that time, nobody defends this, just judges it.
No one will tell you at school that blacks have often been sold into slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one at school will teach you that colonizers often bought land from the Indians, they'll just tell you everywhere how brutally we, Europeans, have killed each other, and they've killed each other a long time ago.
I spent some time in the United States, in schools, in the North, and in the South.
I haven't met with anyone deliberately silenced the facts, but I've heard it before, and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (maybe in Japan the monsters from WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was that history is not black and that we have a tendency to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about feelings, it's just what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge things from then on.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never repeat this again.
By the way, when we're in those southern states, yes, the confederation flag and famous slaves are quite popular there, on the other hand, and they had some good success and I found it absurd to end them.
Moreover, the North wasn't much better than a lot of people idealizing it today.
And a lot of people also forget that not all of them in the South were slaves, and a lot of things opposed them.
I wouldn't compare this with Russia, they deliberately ignore some facts, lie and manipulate, and there's no need for us to look at them (on YT there was also a video from TV, where someone started talking about our Legionaries and 1968).
What came to me at the US schools was the rise in Marxism and idealization of communism, something that their country never experienced.
It seemed to me that at some universities, it was amazing, these students were pretty radicalized, and those schools were supporting them in how many times.
And when I imagine these people getting much older once, I'm a little sick of this being the voice of the majority, because they're between the young and the ruling elite.
I think maybe feminism has already achieved what he had, and it's not about the same, he has been radicalized.
At present, as feminists, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and lead to radicalisation on the contrary, often leading to resistance and rather reasonable things.
And the more someone's more radical, the more they hear it.
Anyway, I also didn't see anyone judging me as colonialism or slavery.
I met with the wrong map, but it was both sides :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely immaterial.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
In addition, the concept of nationality is generally considered to be unnecessary from the point of view of some personal identity.
If I have such interests with people, views of the world and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic fernities, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovenian.
That Slovenian pharaoh is a very nice guy, he's more of a theologian than a politician, but then he always fucks some cocoon about coronavir that everybody's ashamed of.
Then, of course, the Church of Czechoslovakia is a Hussetian.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in fact they were born of Catholic modernism and are actually Catholic without popes.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to Husites for services, because it's theologically very similar, but members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalistic temple on the street of Botanic.
Otherwise the church of St. Michael in Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans, and even there every Sunday at 15:00 a.m. they make Mass in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
Plamina with Betlém is in Czech Republic, the Scouts took him from Austria
Brèclav — A flame blessed in Bethlehem, where, according to the Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Shots for him because of the pandemic of coronavir, but they did not even go to Vienna this time, they took it from their Austrian colleagues to the border crossing Reintal – Břeclav in the morning.
They picked her up at the border last year.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in each year, and I look forward to it.
It's an honor for me to have been chosen, she told the present journalists, the Amálie Budíkov.
While last year the transfer took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly at the border bridge, now at the Rhineal-Breclav crossing at the parking lot.
Usually for him, but the Scouts drive by train to Vienna.
There is no change in the spread of flame after the Czech Republic.
With the Belgian light, they escaped a traditional train to Brno, where it was handed over to the diocese bishop Vojtěch Circlem.
On Saturday, December 18th, the next distribution of light will take care of shoe couriers who will travel by selected fasts and personal trains.
They will take the light from them in the local Scouts or volunteers who will then continue to spread the flames throughout the Czech Republic and where their colleagues do not.
Even this year, Scouts must comply with the applicable measures against the spread of coronavir.
It's just like last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the local action organizers to of course wear gloves, try to follow the break-ups, they were at least not singing to colleagues, they were simply acting so as to be the safest, they described the speakers' actions of the Bethlehem light Zuzan Hrbková.
The tradition of the Belgian light that travels to Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread together with the flame of the thought of peace, peace and peace.
The Bethlehem light is for a believing symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, skates and skates have been trying to spread them for more than 30 years.
Actions stand on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of inviolability and human interdependence.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for the flames, can be found on www.betlemskeslightlo.cz website.
I don't have economic education, so I don't know the basics of the economy that confirm that grants are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think that grants as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education makes good use of the money, even though I do not understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and companies as a whole.
As mentioned, it produces an excess product and penetrates the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work alone in a factory where millions of "xy funded/co-financed by the xy project" are on foot, and such a company is simply artificially held in life.
This is not the support of a company that gives work to x people, this is the acceleration of development when this company keeps and kills contracts/employees to companies that could grow and become more productive after its collapse
It's totally inconceivable.
Sometimes a person who was born online also gets caught up in a trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think Internet ads keep moving with me, but then I guess they've affected me, too - it's just so far out of the way that people don't always get away with it.
For this reason, I support radical voices in the European Parliament, which at the moment want to give a complete ban on programming (= targeted) advertising...
It's all bullshit, classic words - I'd ban the Internet.
I have a feeling of this virus has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe something that most believe and make sense, I am not a sheep, but I will rather believe something that is less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion that I will claim to be a critical thought"
2. "I won't believe everything the media say"
3. "I don't believe politicians"
TVs have dropped the trend of Christmas movies, their premiere this year has two hundred
Los Angeles – China, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have dropped the trend of Christmas movies and this year their viewers in the premiere represent more than two hundred.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years has encouraged and significantly increased audience monitoring, which is why these images are produced more and more.
This year, more than four times the Christmas film was filmed in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database, however, included only the images that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in its name, so it will actually be much more Christmas movies.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, with this period of history especially, the world-wide popular images are also the home of Sam, Love Heaven or the classic Christmas story Life is beautiful from 1946.
The real boom of Christmas images, however, began until in 2009, when a special film series arrived at the American cable TV station Hallmark, the BBC server recalled.
Her advent project called Countdown to Christmas then included four films and was very successful.
This year this station has launched its Christmas sightseeing since October 22nd and will present a total of 42 Christmas images.
The Lifetime Competition Station has 35 new Christmas theme films this year, and they also contribute to a total of the favourite streaming platforms, such as Netflix.
“In this magical period of history, so much does not matter, it is important that there are many Christmas trees and snows in the background,” described this genre Brandon Gray, the author of the book on Christmas movies called I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I’ll be home on Christmas films).
"For the spectators, it is a form of escape and a way of feeling a little calm for at least two hours in the midst of all that Christmas madness and madness of the world in which we have been living for the last few years," Gray added.
For example, he says that Hallmark uses the same recipe for his films, which is even uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with you, but then it's about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding that's going to work out and the two of you're going to like it.
That's how it's always around, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people watch each other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19, will not interfere with the final F1 race.
At the High Price Abu Kill in formula 1, only nineteen riders will appear.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on the covid-19 and will not affect the season until the last race.
Now, Haas will send just one formula on the track.
In the final race, the season was to attack a better location from the 20th grade that he graduated from.
The Russian Nikita Mazepin from the state of Haas, however, will eventually not affect Abu Murder.
He was tested positively for covid-19.
On the starting floor, only nineteen cars will appear, from the last corner will be on the track of Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who plays with Lewis Hamilton in the direct battle.
Mazepin is said to be relatively well Haas and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita's physically okay because she was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the competent public health authorities, while security will be the ultimate priority for all parties involved," its representatives stated for formula1.com.
He's not sending a replacement driver to the Haas race, he can't.
A possible replacement would have to complete the qualifications or rides on another part of the weekend.
With the covid-19, the first racer doesn't meet.
At the beginning of the very final season, the covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year, were positively tested by Sergio Pérez č Lewis Hamilton.

Gold, silver, and 150 diamonds: The price of the most expensive candle is amazing!
It's a little like a portable shrine and a creator put half a year's work into it and all his savings.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but with little experience, the lights at home never worked too much," admits Lebanon, who spent over 3,000 hours in the course of the year.
Hedvábí bought in Italy, 24-carat gold net in France, and 2000 decorated crystals added Swarovski.
The silver stars then gained 150 diamonds.
"The foundation is wool and cotton, but silk adds a light of hecticness," the creator commends his work, which, of course, does not recommend washing.
And there's another hook.
"I'm completely on the run, I have to sell as soon as possible," Lebanon admits.
If he succeeds, he creates a world record.
The traditional most expensive candle, sold five years ago, stood “only” 720 000 crowns.

The government has approved sending up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Women, researchers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They have Polish colleagues to help with the protection of the border with Belarus and the construction of the planned area.
Poland has formally requested the assistance of NATO, in relation to several months of ongoing actions of the Belarusian regime, which in its territory calls on the citizens of the neighbouring countries to make a false commitment to crossing the Union's borders.
In the Polish territory, British and Estonian soldiers are already active.
Mutation Omicron is spreading south of Moravia?
Hygiene's checking another case for Adam's child.
"We have currently reported further suspicions of this option in another child from Adamova, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the U.S. Adams is not proven," Ciupek said.
Six cases have been reported in the country during the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for flu and non-supply viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," the director said.
She added that it is about two nurses from one workplace Faculty Hospital Brno and two children from one of them, two eleven-year-old students from the U.S.A. Adams.
There's no connection between Brno and Adam's cases.
According to the Director, three of them have mild symptoms, four non-prescriptive periods.
No one suspected of Omikron abroad
None of these were foreign residents, nor any of their families, nor were any of those resident abroad contacted.
The relationship with the water field champion is not one of those, Ciupek said.
Chief Hygiene Paul Svrčina once stated that an international tournament was being checked in the water field that was in Brno several weeks ago.
On it were players from the South African Republic, and one Belgian player was sick after returning.
California will limit the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas when he doesn't want to.
Governor California Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to introduce a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the US's most recent state by means of a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against traumas carried out after the detection of the heart rate of the embryo.
People would then claim compensation for anyone who in California manufactures or sells assault rifles and firearms.
Newsoma's announcement responded to the US Supreme Court's Friday opinion, which left a texa ban on abortion in force, although it was against an old previous verdict of almost 50 years, which established the right to land abortion in the whole of the United States by about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court has not now decided on the constitution of the whole law, but on the technical question arising from the innovative design of the measure.
In this case, the ban was transferred to the public, which made it impossible for the Texa Republicans to attack by ordinary judicial procedure.
"I am accused of yesterday's (fifty) decision by the United States Supreme Court, which has allowed the maintenance of a Texas ban on most of the transit services and has greatly supported the Texas maneuver to protect its law," the California governor said.
"If now States can block the review of their laws by federal courts, California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He has entrusted his subjects with the task of working with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice in cooperation with measures that would justify public representatives to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called spirit weapons.
This is the description of the rear-view weapon, which does not have serial numbers and which may be used to protect the regulation.
Newsom wants to have the right to claim at least $10 000 (over 220,000 CZK) and judicial expenses from anyone who would produce, distribute or sell assault rifles in California, parts of the "arms of spirits" or plants for their production.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons out of our streets, create a threat to private complaints, then we should do it exactly," the California governor said.
According to the AP, California had banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons after decades, but in June the federal judge blocked the ban as anti-constitutional.
Since the ban would now be indeed renewed for the use of the texas model, the words of the liberal members of the Sonii Sotomayor Supreme Court, which, in an unconfirmed opinion, warned of the extension of the legal mechanism to other American States, would be confirmed.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant full immunity to the Texa ban in the case of a judicial review and allowed the asylum clinics to continue in appeals against the selected South American factor.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, when it gradually comes to what the vaccination scheme will look like and also comes to improving the vaccines itself, based on the results.
A study of the effects of 4 doses has been conducted in Israel.
And according to these studies, in most patients, there are up to five-fold increases in antibodies, which already has a long-term effect.
Just like any other conception will have after the time of its healing scheme, it's just too soon for it.
Another reason is that a new vaccine should soon be placed on the market, based on an inactivated virus, which, according to the manufacturer’s specification, promises up to 10x greater efficacy.

Poland threatened to suspend payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would act in violation of the law if it exercised new powers and, for the sake of the rule of law, stopped the payment of Poland's money.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan for the allocation of EUR 36 billion from the EU fund for the recovery of the economies affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under the pressure of the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism that enables the Union to receive grants from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this EU-wide investigation alone in all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, the head of the small party of Solidarni Polsko, whose current government would find a close majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, leading to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contribution to the EU.
It would be justifiable in view of the fact that the EU is unlawfully denying us funds from the common budget to which we are also contributing, the Polish minister has added.
Its party to the EU takes on a more radical position than the ruling party to the Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary has made to Ziobro's actions threaten its independence and undermine its independence to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobra, builds "the impossible conditions because its objective is not a rule of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw is facing "political dictatorship by cutting and trying to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of the EU, which is based on the partnership of sovereign states, rather than on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucrats who are not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never join such a division in Brussels, which would restrict the sovereignty of Poland.
"We will never agree with Poland's status as a colony," he said.
But getting to know each other... we have one type of cheese in four different places in Lidla.

When I was a child, I was punished for being a cook.
It was never because of signs, it was mostly because I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (I read instead of going to sleep, washed with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I've never been punished without warning, my mom always threatened to do it again, so I'll get hurt (time and again after another "stealing" just brought in and put it so I can see it).
Just after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a couple of wounds on my back (through the dress).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and measure) are beneficial because a child responds to them much more than words.
I think this part of warning is important, because it gives the child his choice of whether he will not listen or get better or not.
After all, I had only enough warning to start listening.
Protection of the system
When a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl in 1999 replied to the press question, what the Czech institution meant to him – if a solemn record that is sworn and that is rejected in school, or rather an agreement that can be amended if necessary, is definitely attached to the first concept.
We once agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are and who we are, and the changes are better to save.
And imagine: Some nations even like their rules.
Just as the Czechs like rabbits with mushrooms and wildlings, he voted ten times on the question of Vojtěch Cepl.
In recent times, however, there has been a growing awareness among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to be amended.
The summers were tested by situations that its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not predict, for example, the conduct of the elected president.
In one thing, Cepl was right.
All we know about such documents shows that political involvement in their texts must be considered.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, but then it can be a key to overcoming most of the crises that companies face in the face of history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a rule that consists of individual rules that govern politicians to keep the game.
We fear that a lot will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we link policies to bans.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to have their powers.
Covid doesn't choose, in the FN Brno, they fight for the life of a few months-old baby
Although it is known that coronavirus is milder for children, there are also difficult cases with which hospitals are dealing mainly in recent times.
"We know that children are threatened and affected less than adults, they are 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said New Year's prime minister at the Children's Anesthesiology and Resurrection Clinic at the Faculty of Hospitals Brno and the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Masaryk Petr Dominik.
The process is much simpler, easier, often without signs.
But there are children who are with coronavir sick, which we see particularly in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need little support.
It's being performed at a clinic of child infectious diseases.
Very seriously ill children with coronavir are currently on ARU.
Children with postmenopausal syndromes were permanently separated by the physician throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute cavities pneumonia, which means the inflammation of the lungs, which requires a stay on a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease involves adults as well as a few months of babies.
In hospitals there are also children in a difficult condition due to coronavir.
"At present, we have a child of a few months and a teenager," the prime minister said.
It is, however, pleased that in the FN Brno child hospital, no infant deaths were recorded on the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children between the ages of 0 and 14 died in the PRC on 6 December.
According to Dominika, there is an active part of the co-operation of a psychologist in a child hospital – not just in the coronavir department.
At the same time, it also points to the fact that both adult and paediatric patients reduce the duration of the disease and at the same time reduce the incidence of post-covidal syndrome.
“That’s why we recommend treatment for children,” the doctor added.
In a quiet zone, you can only walk on designated roads.
But those quiet zones aren't that big.
They are seen on the tourist map on maps.cz.
Generally in national parks outside the quiet zone, you can walk anywhere (but not across the area).
Skiing/driving in the woods outside the marked roads must never be allowed unless you have an exception (but, of course, it is out of the national park until it is too close).
How's the conductor?
The music's in my head, and Joseph Kurfiert is laughing.

It cooperates with garden philharmonic, film philharmonic, or with a sub-corporeal symphonic orchestra.
China builds the perception of the disease and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China builds the impression of the disease handled and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has become a health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was criticizing him for not being able to stop the disease that has changed into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports a zero increase in the infected.
States, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protection aid and Chinese doctors are often helping in the fight against coronavir, for example in the worst affected Italy.
How do you get Beijing's will?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend will meet a friend and tell him, "Don't you want an elephant?"
I got it and it's great.
The wife likes it because she saves the grass, washes the car, plays with the kids.
It's just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Comrade, I'm gonna cry, it's gonna be great...
After a while they meet and the one who bought them complains: "You guys, what did you sell for an elephant?"???
A man who's been laid down, he's got a shitload of shit all over the place, he's got a car, kids are afraid of him, and his wife wants to get divorced.
The guy who sold it says you're not talking about an elephant, so you don't sell an elephant...
World events are controlled by power.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is precisely the powers that determine the course of international action.
Europe can become such a power only if it works for its integration.
It is still functioning at the level of economic and political (on selected issues), but still lacks military integration.
I personally think that Europe is moving towards federalisation.
It won't be 10 or 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century there'll be different moods and it's going to work.
I've been thinking about it, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert on honesty, so maybe I'm talking.
All I'm saying is that most of the ellipse includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and oranges" when it is clear that it is both from Spain, which in the "Spanish fruit and oranges" it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
In addition, I assume that the phrase "all American forces" means, including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect it is already included in this broad concept and there is no need to further specify it in the American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just talking :D
Whether it's like that or not, it's a pointless requirement.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the monkey cosman Milly
Scary recordings show the moment the frightened monkey slammed in the toilet before her insensitive owner slammed and laughed at her.
The Dutch monkeys also fed the park, kebab and hamburgers, regardless of their actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrate's court in Gwent has now permanently banned cattle, reported The Sun's journal.
Experts on the rehabilitation of monkeys who are taking care of Milly after her invasion said that the frightened cosmos had never seen before.
Milly spent almost two years rehabilitating Monkey World workers in Dorset, and now she is again happy playing with another saved monkey named Moon.
A four-year-old mother has confessed to two charges for causing unnecessary suffering to the protected animal.
She was sentenced to twelve weeks' imprisonment in the Magistrate Court in Gwent.
Holland has also been sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, has received a life-law ban on animals and has to pay 12 000 kroner costs in the calculation of the costs.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabilitated the pet, Steph Sawyer, said, "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue."
It took Milly to get used to people again.
She screamed and hid in front of anyone she met and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is satisfied with the male, she can still cause panic in the eyes of new people.
Psychic scars from the twisting will be carried on forever, says Sawyer.
Milly's driving came out just after the police in Gwen found out that she had a horrible phone call after the crash in her apartment for drug charges.
You can hear Milly sneaking in on the tapes.
In the next video, you can hear Holland's monkey offer cocaine and say, "Do you want cocaine?"
So give me the oil.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to holding cocaine with a view to selling it.
In her home, there was 1,600 pounds of cocaine (over 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Children’s Eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland was sentenced to 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts will you learn from this tradition three times after you've been firmly leaping through the 20th century?
Like you're going to take the same stuff out of class six?
And all of this kills the idea of bifling when no one, most of all, is not interested in whether you can or do it.
Put the test on 1 and then it's no longer anybody's interested.
Go on and on the street, people happen to ask whether to control the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation and coefficients.
Everyone's gone through it, and the absolute majority don't even get sick and tell them they're in a drink.
So, what the fuck does that teach you?
I'm a big fan of a general overview and the reality is that people don't want and don't need it.
And at that point, it's unnecessary and you'll never get it in them anyway.
It's part of learning for a lot of people who'll need that thing.
But like, the note that you don't really need all this, I mean, seriously... because you just don't need it.
Plus, we're getting a little slow until we don't know what a punk sign is.
(In which we are likely to share our Communist past and fight against the students and elites) Of course, the price of being barbarians in these machines is simply high.
If reporters were to be able to count, the covid would probably never have achieved these dimensions.
Wedding at first sight: The War of Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason why Switzerland can't leave immediately," answered Andrea at the Instagram in Stories on all sorts of questions of curious fans, which made her so disappointed at Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even lock him up on social networks.
Between Kadrim and Andrew, it's been stuck since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea was moving behind her, at least until she got back to the Czech Republic.
But she totally refused.
And as you can see, not only did he not end love but he grew up to hate each other.
It was a planned attack from you! Kadri's turn in response to Andre's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
The alleged honesty of Kadri's ex-wife was no longer in love with his younger sister Linda.
She decided to go public.
Normally I don't express myself to such things, and we've never said too much about these things in our family.
I certainly don't want to cause any regret.
But if I see someone who's trying to hurt the public and spit the name of someone I love so much, I just don't give it to me!
I'm sorry I have to do it this way, but I would like to thank my brother Kadrim this publicly for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it the most, even when we were young.
I'm more sorry if I have to read such false information that is probably quite out of context.
I wish everyone knew Kadri as well as me, our loved ones and our families, stood in recognition in response to Andrey's words.
I am truly grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the truth and we know how it really was, added incredibly.
The drunk thief went through the façade to the fifth floor.
You don't believe it for what.
He started his robbery at the parking lot in the residential district, where he was trying to get into several cars.
According to the information available, he finally depreciated from one vehicle the total of 330 crowns.
Then he didn't think anything better than to jump to the 5th floor and enter the apartment with an open window.
He stole two bananas there.
Then he's caught on a security camera, leaving the street from the crime scene and eating bananas.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he found out the bananas weren't where they were, and he called the police.
The next one was the Cchaa.
The man admitted that he drank some alcohol on an incriminated day.
And since he needed money, he decided to steal in his drunken state.
The whole thing's been under investigation.
The drinker went through the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
Pandemic law is time-limited and efficacy bound to the Pandemic emergency.
If this is cancelled, the law will not be effective.
The law, however, restricts the scope of the business
Is that not enough for you?
The right to gather will be limited, but never cancelled.
Over 60 percent of the respondents came to the Saturday elections in four municipalities
New representatives of the people elected on Saturday in the villages of Komňa in Uherskohradišk, Lužice in Mostecka, Nova Ves in Liberek and in Equalna in Pelhrimovska.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has decreased under the law or the elected representatives have fallen.
Of the total 28 candidates, 99 candidates were held on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69, the youngest of 33.
The preparation of the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year.
A total of four new or repeated elections to the General Representatives and, above all, very closely monitored elections to the Embassy, ČSÁ Vice-Chairman Eva Krumpová stated.
She recalled that due to the epidemic of covid-19, the choice of equipment and personal security was more demanding.
In Komni, Uherskohradišk, the Saturday election of the Association of Independent Candidates won 27.76 per cent of the votes and two mandates in the seven-year term.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 per cent of the votes, which also means winning two mandates.
Two seats in the representative’s chair were also won by the Citizens for the Comune, and their vote gave them 18.52 percent of the fans.
Once again, they were re-elected by the current mayor of Jan Křižková, who is a member of the Privates.
The Komjana – independent candidates – achieved one mandate in the representativeship.
75.48 percent of qualified volunteers came to the polls.
In the village of Evná na Pelhřimovska won the Pro Evná Association.
50.50 per cent of the vote, which means four mandates from seven.
Two other representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one of the Association of Independent Candidates 2.
The election rate was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lužica in Mosteck again won the Association of Lužice and Svinčice led by Mayor Jindřich John.
56.73 per cent of the votes received and four mandates in the seven-year term, as well as in 2018.
The second ended the Grand Prix for the people who gave the vote 43,27 per cent of the voters, so three representatives will be represented.
There were 76.7 percent of the volunteers in the urn.
Elections in New All in Liberec have won independent candidates Hope for New Ves before the U.N. push.
For the association of independent candidates, 59.88 percent of the voters voted and thus gained four seats in the weekly general representativeship.
The UN received 40.12 per cent of the vote, and against the right elections in 2018 strengthened, gained more and has three.
The election rate was 42.9 percent.
The results of the elections will be discussed by the State Election Commission on Monday.
Then they'll be published in the Law Collection.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign policy?
I think you know all that people are writing here.
You're just playing stupid to have someone to guess with.
If not, it's sad.
I don't claim that Christians are degenerates or anything.
I even like many church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which at last was the goal to look good).
And I don't care who believes in it.
On the other hand, I wonder how much the church had much in the middle of the century, how much money it saved, the suppression of science, etc.
Not talking about all the wars she's caused, like those three years.
Tl;dr: Believe in the spaghetti monster, but state and church don't have anything to do together
The man fell his head down 12 meters.
The attack on concrete survived.
An incredible fall was experienced by a man in Ostrava on Sunday night, in which the rescuers of the Regional Health Care Service were involved.
The employees of the Regional Operations Centre took over an hour after Saturday afternoon the pressure call with initial information about the fall of men from height.
Two ZZS - medical and medical staff were immediately removed.
Upon arriving at the place, the doctors found that a 17 - year - old man was supposed to fall out of a window about 12 meters high and hit his head on concrete!
A coal catch in the Vitkovices.
But not the way it should be, but the fires went to action.
At the time of the arrival of rescue teams, a man was unconscious, with numerous injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intubating doctor intubated his breathing pathways, secured artificial lung ventilation and, following further measures under pre-patient care, transferred her ambulance to another care of the island traumatological center, informed the speaker ZZS MS region, Lukas Humpl.
I'm more concerned than with coronavir than with inadequate public and public reactions.
The spread of coronavir in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, in the first line of the fight against disease, but it is primarily for doctors and medical staff.
How serious is their situation?
We're asking military doctor David Rezactor.

Legendary Nunes after seven years fell, Oliveira defended the pass
MMA experienced a wonderful gala night full of interesting results.
In the UFC 269 tournament, things were done.
Outsider Julianna Peň has been able to defeat the legendary champion of Amanda Nunes, who has not found the winner for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in a light bond, presented a great crack to Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly broke Cody Garbrandt's technical KO in the first round.
His opponent also defeated Sean O'Malley.
A surprise nobody expected.
That's what brought the women's bantam's weight between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julian Peños.
The American entered into a mutual battle as a mental "trap", Nunes did not lose for seven years and brushed his teeth at another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes had started the trip after the victory very actively and the opponent even saved the push kick she sent to the ground.
However, the money did not make any further mistakes and failed to attempt to attack on its hands.
The second round was touching and for MMA fans very tense.
Both rivals boasted a lot of excellent blows and hard hooks.
Plus, Nunes got the money on the ground where she started squeezing it.
She had to give up her efforts and turn off the attack.
That's how the American made a huge shock when she became a new champion.
There was a battle between Charles Oliveiro and Dustin Poirier at the top of the gala dinner.
In the beginning, however, Poirier was better off, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the second, he was trying to be more active in Oliverira, who the opponent tried to turn his hand around.
He didn't get too happy, but then he created a lot of pressure, got a rival on his back, and he fell asleep in a row of wounds.
That's why he won the second round.
On the third round, Oliveira showed the rear naked shock, which Poirier had a moment of excitement, but then he had to sneez off.
The Brazilian has so defended the title, Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, he subscribed to the sovereign triumph Sean O'Malley, who in the first round placed Rauliana Paivu in the right back.
He then received a number of precisely measured hits and recorded the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to consult Cody Garbrandt.
In spring Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now after seven years lost.
Is that a hook or a hook?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most of the main names in Czech are only one grammatical family, and therefore it is not a problem to determine whether it is a male, female or secondary family.
Then there is also a relatively large number of key names in which the family is not established.
Such fundamental names are interfering between two kinds.
Then, in the case of a shelter, they acquire two limbs and, in some cases, remain in a state of illiteracy.
For example, the words “swivel” or “kiskel” are a kind of male and female, in which the first is to bow according to the pattern “engine”, in the second according to the pattern “song”.
For other key names, different forms are already in the first fall of the single number, i.e. "line/line", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "brambor/brambor" (in food).
Both forms are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, for example, in the Czech Republic and in the Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-written, similar to the other Czech-Morative two words: "knock" and "knock", "knock" and "knock" etc.
Some words that came into the Czech language from other languages were initially inconceivable, but gradually they came to the ears of the Czech connotations.
A typical example is the term “image” which is a family of both men and women, or the word “bufet”, which remained in the middle of the family, but in the male, it has its finals according to the pattern “city”.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like directly on the Greek border?
At the Greek-Turkish border, tension is being waged because of the growing number of migrants who are trying to get further to Europe.
Thousands of people began publishing at the southern border of Schengen after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise Greek support, humanitarian aid is also coming from the Czech government.
What, in fact, motivates refugees to go the wrong way?
And what does the situation look like right on the spot?
We haven't seen the blue sky in three months, and we've been breathing, describing a reporter from Sydney.
The destructive fires that Australia has been facing for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and destroyed millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities there and the people themselves balance with the grave?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government do more to prevent the drastic effects of criticism?
And what will the country have to prepare for the future in terms of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to a journalist from Sydney, Iko Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why it's always written about everyone everywhere.
For people, it's hard to figure out what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, and it's trying to talk about it.
I don't personally know anyone who was falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I have experienced how often they are treated by the people around them or by the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend was that the victims finally opened up about their traumas.
But there's still a lot of people left for themselves.
Yeah, they'll find someone who'll blame someone for being wrong.
It's disgusting and spitting into the face of all the victims of sexual violence, but spreading the idea that "a large part of the charge is meant" and that it's "trend" you only help sex offenders.
Czech Republic floats the houses, families don't have the money to finish
Building materials prices in recent weeks and months have increased by more than 30 percent.
A lot of people got into a state of emergency because of that.
It does not have the means to complete settled family homes and banks refuse to raise mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the cost of construction works is also increased.
So people don't have enough money to complete a family home that's already settled.
In many cases, banks refuse to raise mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move to uninhabited and uninhabited homes.
In the worst case, unoccupied houses are unoccupied and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and pay rent for it," says BHS Economist Štěpán Kreček.
In a year, we will build two to three family homes, and at 50 percent we have.
For us as a construction company, it's hard to keep some things contractual, even though the material has been wasted.
So we're doing without a profit," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slavon.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they calculated that the building of the house is going to be five million, now it's going to be seven.
I think some will wait," Sliven added.
Most of the materials have searched for copper, iron and also installation and heating equipment.
But construction companies are also fighting a lack of workforce.
In the Czech Republic, graduates of the construction sector are missing and foreign workers are forced to stop the pandemic.
It is more favourable at this time only to the situation regarding the issue of a building permit.
"In October, the construction authorities issued 7,675 construction permits, which is almost 10% more than a year ago," Křeček explained.
We're good, and we'll get even better.
Real vision but missing, says ČRO commentor – mujRozhlas
In addition to classical celebrations, entry into the new year has been traditionally conducted also by politicians.
This year, apart from the Prime Minister and the president of ANO Andreje Babis and the Christmas message of President Milos Zeman and the President of the Senate and the Ambassadors.
What's the main thing we've learned?
As in that, I've got my own theme, which I've chosen, I've been working on the bakery, I've always been working on it for a whole year, and then in a week, I'll write a written part.
The states are completely at peace with us if a man is not a total duck and something is left in his head, then the commission will not give him too much thought to the theory.
I may have been studying at the statehouse for a week, and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to point me to some logical drive that I liked right away and I had it right.
Otherwise, I know people who will pay someone to make the semi-annual project for them (we did it many times, really beneficial, much learning) and then only learn the project and are old.
I think it's great when, at the end of the subject, there's a test that shows the knowledge acquired within the project, not just defense.
All right, but don't count emails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be the same bug as they are.
Those people in the embassy don't have to have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can quietly build a similar Putin soybean next to the bear's juice.
You should give her another way to trap Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, though, that Insta throws the artists his fists under his feet.
Once every day you don't give stories and at least every other day the new picture, your accomplishments are reduced to a total minimum.
In addition, the furt changes what is more important for the function, whether a liek, comment or deposit.
I've been really serious lately, so maybe I'll have to cut myself to the point where a lot of artists from my industry are successful and they don't let that happen.
After all, I'd be happy if there's something user-friendly about what's not going on with artists of all creativity and energy.
Declaration of the Donbase Workers' Party
Swazu – yes, break-in – no, state on the picture their opinion of the opposition to break-in of the SSSR.
Thirty years since the illegal break-in of the USSR.
On 8 December 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history occurred.
On 8 December 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuskevič signed an agreement that “Svaz Sváz as an subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist” in the White Vulnery of 17 March 1991.
With one tiny pen, the vast country with nearly three hundred million inhabitants was "cut off".
I'm breaking down the USSR with tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens from abroad.
From the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has fallen by ten to eleven million.
And regardless of the loss of the Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars together!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what had been built in the past 70 years at one meeting in the whitewashes betrayed a socialist camp (created by the price of millions of lives in the Second World War and in the Great Ownership War).
It is known that de-industrialization has been carried out, agriculture has been accelerated, it has withdrawn from the world's largest power of fourteen republics, which had previously been economically linked in a single mechanism.
If we want to see even deeper, then we see the deterioration of the population, the collapse of the economy, the sciences, the armies, the growth of crime, the inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in post-world space, the series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion to the east, the war and the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all this is the result of geopolitical capitalism, the surrender of the Socialist camp first, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in politics as "vacuum force".
Everything that has been quickly hurt and given up has quickly been filled up and gained by NATO countries that have accepted our geopolitical capitalisation.
And today the whole world is shocked by the events of the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
The price of the product sold in the supermarket with a large turnover does not have to correspond directly to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it by getting it in the fridge and make it a Thursday dinner.
In the alternative reality, in which I don't buy this meat on Monday, it's in the Tuesday chain to 99 Kč / kg - will you write me a mechanism that will change its prices because of my system of living?
And either I wait until Thursday and this meat will be exhausted 1 day before the date of consumption at 69 Kč / kg - what would this meat be different from what I bought on Monday at 120 Kč train and left it 3 days in my refrigerator?
I'll answer it myself - nothing.
These craps about if something's cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, damaged or unqualityd are terribly retarded to tell you the truth;-)
Recently I went to Brno to Hlavas, and in the basement, the lady gave me a brochure, like, always taking things to help the brigades, they couldn't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of village intelligence and conservative views on the world's functioning, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I realized it was going to be such an agit.
After reading it, I found someone who was publishing it and finally came out of it.
Well, like it was a good mother, full of completely unnecessary lessons, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pussy.
The damage to the paper, because of this, would not have forced the casket.
I've had something like that with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional exaggeration force you to make this person answer because you like him without realizing how much in the p*part of this situation is.
She threatened me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to see out.
Or even when I wanted to get out of her apartment, she broke up and asked me not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
Cca year was a great relationship, but then he ran for another half year and started kicking her on the thumb.
Then I ended the relationship with the one I told her I was leaving and lying to her, but we could talk about it next week to calm her down and not catch some ammo again.
Such a person is filled with feelings, emotions, and total joy.
I'd rather hold back.
If the insurance companies steal out of here by buying dark tests and hunting for positives that wouldn't even know about that terrible disease.
The only thing we achieve is the complication for companies, carriers and others, because their employees in the random number generator have fallen into five days of domestic prison.
In the West, they've already stopped with the witch and admitted that there's no value in solving the disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, War is new and has to steal something else and drive an ego by the invention of drilling.
I see we're back with a good old shirt.
After a few years of drowning and suppressing this greedy business, MLM recruiting returns to the broadcast.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, champion at VS), the initial promises of product training and trade skills quickly turned into "you don't have to be interested in it, mostly getting people."
I was sincerely interested in the products I offered, because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare and incest people.
When the first made money came, a person quickly realized that if he wanted to make it, he had to chew a few certain products each month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable, or a person felt like a underground retailer.
What I can say, however, is that experience was valuable, a person learned that he should not jump immediately to every corner and check the information carefully.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw all of them into one loop.
People in this business are successful and even successful, but they will certainly not be praised with expensive consumer goods or a "duty" account.
In the corporation where I'm doing a lot of these things, I didn't live.
The HR is calm, the managers are looking at their management and they don't have much to do with us.
Regular evaluation is somehow going on, in the form that this is going on with us (set some goals for next year, let's see what went on and what didn't) - it's more self-assessment than someone would value you by some numbers, and so on.
Company shares are also optional.
But we're also a little isolated within our company - there's a department that's more "corporative".
Sometimes a person feels like we're such a close-startup that's squatting in the offices of the big corporation no.
But it doesn't work that way until the results.
The Czech missing in Britain is after death.
Her body was found in London.
Almost ten days after the missing 32-year-old Chechnya lost at the end of November.
On Sunday 12 December, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced in the Jakub Kulhanek demise on social networks that a woman from Uherkohradska was found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police have confirmed to our representative office in London this afternoon that the body of the missing Czech citizens has been found.
The cause of death is being investigated.
In view of the family, we will not be giving more information to the case.
An honest condolence, he posted on Twitter Kulhanek.
The young woman was last seen on the bus on the 28th of November on her way from work, and she had to pick up the money from the ATM before her arrival.
Her disappearance was reported by workmates five days later.
Next, the London police raided her, Interpol classified her among the wrong people all over the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police in this regard have kept one man a few days ago.
What he was supposed to do, and what he suspected, but she didn't.
In the four municipalities, new representatives were assigned at the end of the year
On Saturday, December 11, the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradiška, Lužice in Mostecka, Nova Ves in Liberek and Evenna in Pelhrimovska chose new representatives.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has decreased under the law or the elected representatives have fallen.
About 28 mandates were held in new elections by 99 valid candidates.
The vote amounted to 62,41 %.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Equalna, where 93.62% of eligible volunteers were elected.
The mandate received a total of 8 women and 20 men.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest is 33.
A total of 13 candidates were registered for the new elections to the representatives of the four municipalities.
There were 36 women and 63 men in the 28 deputy posts.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years, the oldest 72 years.
The preparation of the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year.
There have been four new or repeated elections to the General Representatives and, above all, very closely followed elections to the Constable.
At the same time, we had to work mostly under more demanding epidemiological conditions, which put greater demands on equipment and personal security, Eva Krump, the 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, assessed.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 3:49 p.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission and will be published in the Laws Collection after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
To cope with the fact that we have a very dangerous infectious disease here at the very beginning of the day, it took a while, but it went without a bigger backbone.
To deal with how idiotic a large part of the population is getting into it on all its layers, I have a problem with it so far.
I'm looking forward to it (tomorrow!) because it finally makes me less dependent on the fact that other people aren't shit.
He would be relieved of the President's duties and the ability to recapture her.
The chance of it really comes to it, but it's like the rest of us are talking about a lot of things here.
Besides, I'm not sure if the pendant would be able to consider himself a magnificent.
It is an act which threatens the President of the Republic's sovereignty, territorial integrity or the democratic nature of the state.
It must have been more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: Increased numbers of people up to 35 years who have no sex all year
The more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
This is mainly about religious-based people, the DailyMail web site.
The survey showed that between 2008 and 2021, the proportion of young people who claim to be sexually active rose from eight to 21 percent.
A woman between the ages of 18 and 35 who stated that she had no sexual intercourse in recent years is more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, as shown by the study of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these may be the economic effects of the coronavir pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
However, it was also possible to contribute to the presence of media, social networks or video games that make young people less and less priority.
“From 2010 onwards, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 is growing rapidly, indicating that they did not have sex in the previous year,” said researcher IFS Lyman Stone.
In marriage, sexual activity is more common, with only 5% of those reported in 2021 as having no sex in the last year.
Stone added that marriage under 35 is only a small percentage.
Then sexual activity also contributes to fear of premarital contact and religious foundation.
Although sexual activity is more likely to occur among husbands, the percentage of married and married to younger ones is still declining for 35 years.
Young people share an opinion of premarital sex, about 30% of them have a bad thing, while about 70% think they're okay.
"It is true that among the free individuals in this age group are minority, but their behavior is changing this trend," Stone says about these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, this is the reason for religious foundations.
Since 2008, for free people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the proportion of absenteeism has increased from 20 to nearly 60 %.
Among the "less believers" the trend rose from 10 to 20%," Stone said.
The decline in sexual activity also contributes to other factors, such as less social interaction and, above all, the social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic.
The study also showed that sex is less likely to be with people without work or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media that probably reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, and this need is “recorded”.
This trend was mainly caught in lockdown at the time of the coronary pandemic.
The whole administration of covid vaccination is about whether the company should bring part of the population to behavior that they do not want but which can save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question that I'm personally interested in the question of social consciousness.
For example, the question is, if we don't do it to them and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly have killed an 80-year-old who didn't know much about it, we didn't explain it well, he listened to some disinformation, and as a result he didn't have to look at it and finally caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think that we can die of a strong opposition to the blackmail, which on the side of the SPD and the KSCH is calling for something about reproach and totalitarian state.
Of the statistics that I mentioned, it can be quite clear that most unaccompanied pensioners are probably part of the second group, so they will really be able to do it themselves.
Czech without snow.
How does a mild winter sign up for a dry fight?
This winter has brought one of the smallest snowflakes in the Czech Republic for the last time.
Operators of ski resorts will not pass without technical snow, weather complicates the preparation of the Jizera Paidage.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for the fight of drought in the Czech Republic?
I should have a story, but it's not about a doll.
One time at high school, the teacher led us across the city on the boat so that we could get a project on the ships along the river.
On the way there we went once such a wide street and whom we probably don't see in the middle - the steps of the Hare Krišna sect.
Of course, they fell on us.
I'm lucky I ran away, but with a friend, they went to talk.
When she left, we asked her and her teacher what she was saying.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she answered.
All of us, including the teachers, have been laughing all the way to the shipyard.
We're so upset.
It doesn't happen that much, but the system is already playing, says Orozovich
The new German office of Olaf Scholz, following previous visits to Paris and Brussels on Sunday, flew to Warsaw, where Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki welcomed her with military direction.
"We are opening up a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the discussion.
Scholz stressed that Europe must jointly state that it will not accept violations of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, caused by the worrying movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian borders, is, according to the Chancellor, to deal with the use of diplomatic negotiations, even within the framework of the "Normandian groups", which unite France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that he informed the office about the situation at the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko has artificially triggered a migration crisis and uses people as living targets and weapons because we record a hundred attempts every night to cross the border (illegal) across borders.
He talked to the office about further sanctions so that Lukashenko's regime and his patrons in Kremlin finally understood that we were determined to prevent the EU's eastern border.
Scholz, according to the DPA agency, ensured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the Dutch treatment of Lukashenko's regime with the runners.
The drunk Polish mirror caused an accident, trying to keep it secret.
After a while the car returned to the scene of the accident, the car was driving another jeep who tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that even if she was not allowed to take advantage of the ride and get caught from the crash site, she came out with the truth, she introduced TVN24.
She admitted that she found another nun in the vehicle who asked her for help.
Then the cops came for Sister Celestine.
She was subjected to breath tests and after they found out that she was in the blood for two minutes, she was immediately given a driving licence.
At the same time, she was informed that she would be heard by the court for her actions.
Dog Hugo does what he can.
He's been chasing Shimovic, but he didn't stop his film.
The Czech family comedians were watching American fairy tales.
But they forgot the essential thing about it: the laws of the film novel.
After the dance film F. Brabce Gump - a dog who taught people to live, we now have another video about the dramatic emotion in the movies here we watch.
The co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Shajmovič ml. freely insists on his previous film Here I watch from 2012.
On stage, a talking horseman returns to Hugo and some famous figures around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owner of the forest pension, who's making a comedian, and then they start calling him a poet, Julie's father with a partner and mostly her daughter Veronica.
She's not a little girl anymore, she's a grown-up girl who's been living her first love.
The director with his partner Beatriz Shajmovic (which is also a producer of the film) met with the reporting procedures already in the previous song, but there were at least children and dogs.
This time, she wrote an even weaker script to create a mixture of surprises and feelings of shyness.
Let's cut it down.
Julie, though a scientist, suffers from a child’s miscarriage and when the correct “constellations” comes together with her forest engineer Ivan, where the coordinates precisely determine – on the cape of a car or church tower (especially during a journey with a local guide), the distinguished Colonel Mojmír, despite his flying training, is shot in the forest by his own daughter (Julia), who falls into a coma, which the family is taken to the hospital so that a miracle healing process can be performed in the heart of the forest.
Nothing against the clean treatment of nature and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer, however, was amazed at the content of the hummingbird, and the figure was needed for this message.
Two thieves from staff, dog competition, forest charlatan, police coming to the event to look for "drugs" and discussing the herbs of the humid force of bone marrow – and which a family in the pension is obviously an opium.
When a hero is examined after a heavy coma and the cake is placed on the ground with a cigarette at the family table and the father’s whisky and dishes are required to be treated with vegetarians, it cannot be denied.
Svrch's more viewers will explain that "sometimes it becomes a comet."
Sheimovic's team lacks basic dramatic knowledge of text work, the ability to build a bear situation, the sense of character and the point and direction.
The heretic performances are unbalanced, the roofless, and the overall impression is punctured.
Whatever Lukas Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová are trying to get their party up, they don't have much to play.
The only piece of film remains the poetic footage of the Wooden cameraman Vladimir Holomk and the two Horsemen.
It is not enough to plan a number of characters, a four - story puzzle, and a dog’s speech, but the more human vulgar expressions that the characters allow.
The argument is not even a summer member at the Horsebearers Club - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote the nature and friendship of a person with a dog must also be knowledge of the handcuffs if one wants to tell a credible story.
That didn't happen in this case.
There's a little bit of eroticity and a minimum sense of genre for a good family picture.
Even as an ad in cannabis therapy, this amateur-acquired piece wouldn't go through.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to the constant inputs from assholes like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here's how you get it, but it's just because you never tried.
The decision is always on the customer, if he doesn't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you had listened to such a kid, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like any other, in which case a brigade for an assignment.
Near the east is usually dry for months.
Winter is the only time in the year when it rains.
"The whole absence of precipitation during November, as we noted at some stations, is unusual," the Israeli Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long - term strike average in November.
That's why the two-day rain this week was rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't been a long time.
It's also the right Christmas scene, the inhabitants of Nazareth were delighted with Wasim Ashkar.
The strikes in Israel come only in the winter months, are offensive and irregular.
In the winter rains there are dependent forests.
Without them, they ask and are prone to fire.
It's not only about forests, it's also about drinking water supplies, and it's about farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, this year, thanks to the last three rainy winters, it filled the coast.
Since then, there's been a fall in the cold.
The water managers were warning the droughts a long time ago.
“It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be a drop in impact here,” the Israeli Water Management Office spokesperson Uri Schor predicted in 2018.
Israel can help with technologies, such as waste water disposal or recycling.
The worst are economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria or Jordan.
In the streets of the main city of Jordan, Amman, there are tanker cars.
Water and private wells dry.
"This year I received orders of seventy-eight percent compared to two previous years," said Imád Sulejman, a tanker driver in September.
In Iran's Isfahan, there were cracks between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was dry.
The wells of the local river felt completely waterless.
The region has the driest November in the last many years.
Israel prepares military intervention against Iran
The Israeli Defence Minister declared that the dialogue in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and informed Washington of the preparations for the attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz announced on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a military attack against Iran, Jonathan Lis informs.
Gantz, who lives in the United States, is trying to convince the Americans to release their pressure on Iran, but he also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and the world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them".
About three years ago, this happened to me, too.
I had a little bit of puke when I was in the interview to find out what she wanted me to do.
Finally, I found out that my suspicion of pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these subversives, so I've been having some doubts and questions for a while, and I finally thanked and left.
Tell me I'm in danger, but the pyramid is a pyramid, and the financial advisors are financial advisers.
The lodgers of the weekend went out to the mountains, waiting for them snow and good weather
The mountain centre in Czech Republic experienced this weekend's first major effort by skiers.
After an efficient snowing at the end of the week, it is not about snowing and some skiers started operating.
The host has not committed an obligation to prove himself in the course of a covid certificate.
While the tractors do not complain about customers’ lack of interest, some ski equipment loans report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
In the run-up, thousands of people in the Liberian countryside were also interviewed on the weekend.
The skiers wanted the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
"We're calm, that opening weekend really came out of Friday night skiing, when we had on the hill of the first skier," said Jashted Jakub Hanush, director of the Sports Area.
Hundreds of people expressed their appreciation for the first weekend skiing in the new season, as well as for the Jessenics.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or the centre in Branná na Schumpersk had been opened.
The weekend visit was very good, and 400 people were expected on Saturday.
The conditions are correct.
Today the sun shone, it was about minus three degrees, so perfect, he did not observe the praise of the representative of the ski resort in Branné Rostislav Procházka.
Skiareal operators may sell ships only to people who are infected or are in the period after the disease has been diagnosed with covid-19.
With the exception of the people being prepared for this and proving the necessary evidence, CZEK René Hrones from Špindler’s Mlýn ski center said.
"We've only recorded incident units," he added.
Less interest than before the pandemic is reported by some ski equipment lending and sales.
They're lucky to be interested in loaning.
It's not like in the past years, but it's still a lot of customers, led by Alexandra Bokiš from the opava store Skiopava.
More effort is expected during ski courses.
Also, the acting king of Snowbear David Shintak feels that because of the covid, it is not about lending ski equipment such an interest as before.
This time before the pandemic, we were almost disbursed.
In contrast to the period before the pandemic, we have about 50 percent, the CHK Shinták said.
According to him, the people with the pandemic were lenient and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand is recorded in the Novako area on God’s Daru.
They started there a week ago, and the people who were interested now have to order them in advance.
"We start to borrow trains this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect great interest, just like last year," said the operator of the Pavlín Novakova area.
The interest comparable to the period prior to the epidemic is, according to it, also about a ski school.
If we want success and wealth not to go abroad, there must be an opportunity to live a quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to obtain a dentist or a specialist doctor.
There's smart people going abroad who don't have any property.
The owner of a foreign company is not going to leave.
But I agree with the rest.
Unless these people live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began by winning Orbán one beautiful day, ruling the year, and at the same time annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that from day to day, the Czech cannot feel in a similar position.
The next question is no choice.
If he's gonna live here, he can win some traditional V4 nut.
Young people and education will leave, their supporters and people whose property is not to be taken to the plane.
It's a scary picture!
Longmayer in the blood because of a beer bet?
While in the Czech Republic there was a full-flow autumn, in Thailand, the film staff in front of Jiří Langmayer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
At the same time, the actor on social networks published a blood photo of his face.
Is it a real injury, or is it a film show?
The London police are still searching for the unknown Czech.
She was last watched on the way home.
"The disappearance of Peter does not like her behavior and we are beginning to be very concerned about her," said Lucy O'Connor in a Saturday video from the police department in Lambeth, where Srncová worked.
“ Her family in the Czech Republic is also worried about her, and she wants to know where she is,” she continued.
The missing Czech woman said on Sunday 28 November around 19:45 left work and headed home to the quarter of Camberwell.
Last time she was supposed to be on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her collaborators.
According to the British media, the heart rate was "assistant of nurses" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the hospital's Guy's and St Thomas' Association.
"We have an unrelenting concern about our dear colleague Peter, who is not famous," a group of health devices stated in a Twitter contribution.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help her to contact the police," the communication continued.
The public also calls for the cooperation of Mrs Harriet Harman, who pointed out the case at the press conference on Saturday.
"She's been unconscious for a few days, she's only 32 years, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandable to the death of the establishment," said laborist politician, holding a photograph of the woman in her hand distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was outside her home country, leaving the family and working here for our health," Harman said.
The police had already kept a man in custody in connection with the case.
According to the BBC reporting website, however, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what man is suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
That's not how I underestimate Ukraine.
It's not a huge amount, it's about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine constantly repeats the threat of the Invasion and begins to have our entrance full teeth.
I quoted it upstairs.
I don't know what you thought Russia wanted for war.
The war is hell of a fun and Russia has HDP Italy.
Comparison with the situation in year 38 is beyond so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare it to the first war in the country and the "an annex" sycilia :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it was unwilling to comply with agreements from Minsk, Russia is investigating those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" on the borders would do.
Ono, I'm a servant of the covenant...
New driving rules apply in Prague since Sunday, mainly to urban connections
The passengers in the Prague Integrated Transport (PID) are waiting from Sunday for a number of changes that relate in particular to urban connections.
New lines have emerged, some have changed the route, and others have disappeared.
The integrated system is being re-integrated to Mladoboleslavsko.
In the main city from Sunday they stop fast from the Czech Budjejovic in the Zagradně City station.
In the suburban train transport, S7 trains will be driven along the route from Beroon to the Czech Brod to Prague’s main station.
In the recently run Prague-Zagradně town station, the R17 fast will stop again from the Czech Budjejovic and Benešova.
The PID will be further extended to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to the World of Sázavou, Blatna at Jesenice, Old Splavů and Turnov.
Buses will be included in Mladoboleslavska, including a line with a crossing to the Liberian and Royal Garden.
Seventy-seven lines, 37 new lines are introduced for integration and the operation will be adjusted on the 12 functioning.
From Prague Zlicín will issue a new bus line 405, which will go to Jatce.
A new direct connection was also created by Prague – Kralovice at Rakovník, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
They will be strengthened in the early peak and on the weekend of the connection from Prague to Rakovník, when the new express line number 404 will be issued.
Newly included in the PID system are lines 400 and 410 driving to the Liberian country.
They're leaving the Střížkov Metro Station, not from the Holesovic Station Station.
The 400 parent line goes through Mělník, Dubo and Czech Lip to New Bor and the selected links continue to Rumburk or Cvikova.
Additional line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimon and Jablonno in Podješdí.
On the contrary, there is a new operation on dozens of medieval local routes, including Mochova, Dobříše or Rožmital under Tremšin.
All trains leaving Prague were cancelled at 02:30.
Due to the modernization of the railways, long-term restrictions continue on the tracks of Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Lab and around Kolín.
Changes are waiting for passengers in other places as well.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or extend the line 420 from Goodříše with a train from Prague, where it is possible to use the PID to Milevska.
The routes between 540 and 543 have been changed in Nymburska and the routes of some buses on the border of central Czech and Horovick in the Plzeńsk region have been adjusted.
Sanitary kitchen/dining at the supermarket office
Hi, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only chance of getting food is to go by Billy's side or take a little further to Lidla.
Since I don't have any movement, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietily as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and I'll buy as fast as possible a pizza ground and a yogurt cake and apple.
Question: What would you recommend to buy in the supermarket without the need for heat adjustment?
Not everyone's waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately they are.
And it's not about trees you need to see.
Under the snow, only the tree tip can be hidden.
If destroyed, the tree may be more prone to fungal disease.
I don't think that's the only reason we're forbidden to drive outside the lobby, but it's one of them.
Dary's confession of the relationship with the stranger: I'm not happy about this at all.
The Czech showbyznish fisherman since Friday is nothing but the discovery of the relationship of Dary Rollins and Paul Neved.
They've been pulling it together for years, and the famous footballer even let himself get divorced because of the singer.
The gift now sent to the fans a comprehensive message explaining why love has been a long half secret in front of them.
"I allow myself to argue that there is no one currently present in the Czech Republic or in Slovakia who would avoid that Dara was caught by a bear, i.e. sorry, Nevida," says Dara Rollins, who is in the most successful Czech footballer in love with her ears.
I think he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are in the public interest, they are not happy about it.
And it's here.
What we both didn't enjoy, but we knew it would happen once, the singer continued.
I just don't know who's worse at it.
If those who don't care about it and jump it out of the can, or we're the ones whose lives are under discussion.
As if one of you wanted to hear your opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend were getting along enough, or you were insisting that everyone really know the list of your former partners and were aware of your mistakes and mistakes.
It's a goose, you want it, Uncle Dara.
The two went together in Italy, where Rollins drove for the preparations of his new fashion collection.
There's a misconception that has long been acting as vice president of the Juventus football club.
The truth is, they're out of the way right now, because they're waiting for the Negro's divorce to be completed.
Ivan's wife and I have been separated for three years, but they're not theirs for just three weeks.
Anyway, to those who are happy with us and who want to, thank you.
We are just people, we have families, children, the past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we have both hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband, and just like him, I'm standing with him.
Hey, the other commentators are probably all essential, I'm just confirming that the colleges are great at first, my associates mostly met during the first semester or two, and they've come to know each other, and they've found each other together, which is my best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
The apartments aren't mostly insinuating too long ahead, so now you probably won't find too much, but looking at the offer will certainly not hurt.
Otherwise, avoid not only Ceylu, but also around (the streets such as Vranovska, French etc., it is quite a bad address), and some parts of the Jews are a bit ghetto.
On the contrary, the district of Veveří is very student, the King's field and in this direction it's nice, and it's close to most of the faculty of VUT (I don't know exactly where you're going).
So I've never hated rent, but I'm a family Brňák, so I can, in any case, talk to Brn as if you were missing some more information :)
But that's an example of completely normal thinking.
Because of what several doctors have decided to do in Poland, it is actually quite right that the state does not finance enough some schools.
Whether they learn what they want and pay for it from their own, or whether they go according to the state, they pay the state.
However, we cannot let a private actor control the part of the school simply because a couple of crowns will be suitable for a proper state contribution and will thus be able to teach in schools what he wants.
Such a claim may lose some weight when it is written by a person who, two days ago, expressed himself as a petition for the boycott of a totalitarian state:
So the vote against it if anyone goes to the funeral is the same for you as the vote against it to make some socha stand in the square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the man who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I've already experienced in cataloging/digitalization that (and even for a long time professional) it's kind of a good thing from the eye, or I'll write something like xxx *** or ... (according to the convention) and to the note that it's unreadable.
The truth is, in this case it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it completely.
Personally, I'd deal with it in some way, depending on the program you're using.
If you want to be a good and diligent student, you can look into some sign database and find the nearest one.
But because it looks like you're dropping out of some book, I'd guess the author or printer just created his own sign, which is sitting on what's physically on that coin.
PS: Isn't it more of an Easter kingdom (the kingdom) than OdryNská?
PSS: Someone's already busted your ass.
Leave a comment with the FILH
Politicians don't even know what will be the theme of our presidency.
It's a lot worse than having interpreters with them.
She pretends to approve something because no one understands a text, it's ridiculous.
All the relevant approved documents are examined word by word, and there is not enough basic knowledge of English, which is the matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and translators are working in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for informal contacts, the binding of overstandard relationships.
In addition, it is quite interesting with the English after the EU's GB.
I don't understand the hat on Chile.
I've been working there for the third year and all right.
How many times do I drive from work I at 10 p.m. and never a problem.
The fact that it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who's barely broken up in life.
Yeah, there's probably a majority of the Roman population of Brno, but the only thing they do is stop them from walking and parking where they don't have :D is definitely not that I'd be afraid to go out there tonight.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I'd go to it quietly.
A lot of apartments are now renovated or newly built.
Felix Slovene (78) without Dads and sweethearts Gelem as a hook in the board!
Who's spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most of the people on the adventurous district lit their first candle, Felix Slováček no.
I don't have an adventurous birthday, so there was nothing to burn.
I saw the birthday gifts, and Lucie must have had one, too, said the bright saxophoneist, who so confirmed Patras's words that he often visits her.
He's visiting, but he's not staying in their house at the Vinohradech, where Dada stayed alone after his departure.
She still doesn't know where she'll be on Friday night.
We recently met with Annick, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slovakia and Lucie Gelem: ZASE SPOLU!
Felix Slovakia and Lucie Gelem: ZASE SPOLU!
But we kept talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'm going.
I'm buying gifts all the time and I'm sure I'll buy Dad and Lucia something, maybe perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the cross of the music video at Richman Club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I'll always find someone I like to deal with, says the Slovene, who was happy to meet his wife, Human Saturday Adrian, or the singer, Kamil Nyvelt.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland, so we can afford to have no soldiers and no weapons?
I doubt someone will defend us for us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a total idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why it's supposed to be a bad argument, so explain it to me?
I don't know any other ingredient that could be in a hospital crisis.
The police are few and they can't afford it, so firefighters and nowhere else is the high percentage of trained people at that level.
And the fact that our army is capable of preventing Ostrava from going to the head of the previous government, not the army, is asking for new toys for a long time.
Record dry in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a factory for food, says the newspaper.
Czech Republic has been going through the worst dry season in recent years.
According to scientists, the waters were in mountainous and sub-horticultural areas, and smaller peaks of precipitation are also noted where there was no need for moisture.
The reason for the drought in much of Central Europe is climate change.
But the impact also strengthens the way we manage the land.
What do you want me to prepare for?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, well, I'm barely going to get stuck in the skunks on the ice, and I'm sure I know what to play hockey and the tactic (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total hall.
And whether you're a hockey team "Russia Bear" or "China Lama" you lose by two goals, even if you don't have to win the game at all costs, it's different than when it's compared.
But just as I listen to Czech commentators who smoke, what the decision-makers do not notice, whether it's a male or a female hockey, it's all weird, but it's probably with all sports, UEFA and "Italian players" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And theirs, if it were the other way around, it's like it's always been, and that the Czech Republic and Russia have lost more often than they won, it's probably the classic "they've lost" all the "MY we've won".
Coronavirus: The number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily diseases.
5766 people were hospitalized.
Overall, 34 451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
The cases confirmed in the last 14 days are 100 000 in the PRC, 871 100 000 in the last week.
The number of injuries in Russia exceeded 10 million Sunday.
In the last 24 hours 29 929 new diseases have been registered.
It's the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, it's the lowest daily number of deaths since the end of October.
Britain faces a "unavoidable" large wave of infection caused by Omicron on Sunday on Dr. Susan Hopkins' television, the main medical advisor for the British Health Office.
There will be a need for new quarantine measures.
People infected with micron have already been hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their number to rise.
No one has ever died on omicron, but hospitalization occurs about fourteen days after the accident and about three weeks after the accident.
The chief of British laborers, Keir Starmer, observed on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently violated the law by setting up a Christmas party at Downing Street last December, when he was introduced to lockdown and banned.
One of Johnson's government ministers pretended that the Quiz was "virtual" through the computer.
However, he was attended by a group of employees gathered around computers at Downing Street.
In Britain, pressure to remove Johnson from the premier function is strong.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers arranged a series of weddings despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media say that Johnson and his government were making fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV commercial television for Britain: Today, two years ago Boris Johnson won the jury in most of the general elections.
The Conservative Party is speaking this morning about the need to remove him from the prime minister's office.
It's remarkable how fast things have developed.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary awaits the spring of elections that can end the twelve-year-old government of Victor Orbán.
It will be a choice of European importance.
How can you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They're probably not even free because they weren't even the last two elections under Orbán.
His party Fidesz controls the media, changes the electoral boundaries to benefit from it, and makes more or less tricks.
The last one so far sounds like everyone can choose where they want in practice.
This will allow Fides to tie voters from decided territories to those where the result is not true and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
It's a very different situation.
It's been a long time, not if Fides wins, but how much and if he's going to have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will get united opposition.
It's for Victor Orbán and his party a big surprise.
They won't be able to keep playing much harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they're ready to go into what they've been doing so far.
Recently, she fled to independent media footage of the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz László Kövér, where secret services officials said that the opposition was a threat to national security.
These are the signs of the new approach you're talking about?
Yeah, that's one of the news.
It's all starting with language.
I was beaten quite often, last time in 14, my mom's parents don't have much patience, I don't, her dad has a long time, but then she blows extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I was very choleric and I grew up to be a little scary, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a cricket and being all blue, it took me about 2x to calm down.
Sometimes they danced to me, sometimes it was more like they didn't know.
I certainly now have a tendency to deal with things with violence, as I was a little bit of a wash, now to get rid of at least something, and as a younger parent I need to cry so much over my hands (so that I don't get too much over the hold), so I don't have anything extreme, but I always have the push.
I'm not able to determine to what extent this is my exuberance, but I'm sure that education has its share.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with my children and deal with it the same way.
I think beating kids is just bad and my parents didn't have to do it, especially not at the time it wasn't "genuine" anymore, but from frustration, on the other hand, if every parent just shits something, it's probably not possible for their kids not to shake a little bit, so I don't tell them.
It doesn't bother me at all, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of something.
The laws are to be clear and clear.
So I would call the kundami who make laws of such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not afraid of a income accident?
Can you really count on people to want and buy a product and you'll have what mortgage to pay for?
The cat's crazy world.
Where does Slovakia suspend the process with the killers of the journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins with four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martiny Kušnírová.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partners changed Slovakia.
She was a civil society, but she also discovered the practices of the defendant, Marián Kočer, and his connection to the points of Slovenian politics and justice.
How is the main break going to be the process for Slovakia?
That's what journalists can do for this huge thing.
How is it possible that this petition had more regular media attention than the anti-pects of the deacons of all medical colleges that came out of the day, two later?
Anyway, they let themselves get fucked up, and the company blew it off.
On Czech television, she died with the baby half a year ago.
The next government will end and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of warehouses nowhere
Mr Karl Havlíčka's proposal needs to be recast in principle
The Government of Prime Minister Andreje Babish is at the end and the law that should ensure that the interests of the municipalities and their citizens are respected in the selection and authorisation of the deep storage of highly radioactive waste still do not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government interrupted the discussion of a proposal submitted by the Government after the summer trips to the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
However, its contents are in serious conflict not only with the affected countries associated with the Platform against the Deep Storage, but also with the Svaz City and the municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-governments expect to strengthen their ability to decide on the depositary, which they have been promised since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which requires the Czech Atomic Law and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in line with its proposal for a coalition, to work together with the countries.
The proposal for a law by Minister Karl Havlíčka, who has the Platform available, affects the municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the location of the warehouse is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens.
It can be really effective only if the municipality or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the given location at all.
This may be ensured by the deposit of the obligation of the Depositary Authority to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before the initiation of a specific procedure.
The proposed eternal purpose almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically exclusively statistics in the recruitment proceedings.
In the proposal, there is a lack of system setting of compensation for municipalities for the whole process of finding and selecting sites for storage, authorisation and operation.
The local representatives really do not have the opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a place of storage, according to today's legal standards.
However, only in certain authorisations may they make their comments or withdraw, the Authority or the Minister in whose interest they are authorised to issue them shall decide.
The complaint shall not have a residual effect on the conduct of research or construction works.
The co-decision of the self-governments required by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically mature countries and definitely in those where they have already advanced in the approval of the warehouse, such as in Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is, in addition to the other failure of the state administration, which rents external legal offices for the preparation of legislation.
In this case, the contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o. concluded by SURAO and related to contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánk.
According to the contract register, the total amount for this work is about 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknikka, local mayor of Ceyle from the town of Crádek and the Talker Platforms against the deep warehouse, said: After the ministers of industry, who are comparing self-government to state authorities in searching for a deep warehouse of highly radioactive wastes, we are looking for a more significant turnout from the new government.
We offer it with a hand.
We also appreciate the support of the Svazu city and municipality, which takes into account the problem of the rights of municipalities in such basic buildings as those directly concerned in the selected localities.
The Platform against the Deep Depot combines 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 companies) with a view to introducing a change in the state's approach to fuel-fired fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not only be confined to the Deep Depot.
The Platform further recommends that a decision on the selection of the site for possible storage be made subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
The heart of John Goodman (69) contributed to the loss of fear: Shodil 90 kg.
Although his life - style for many years did not need to change anything, his doctors finally scared him.
They told him that if he doesn't lose, he'll die.
And that took it.
Goodman gradually weighed 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun's journal.
His new position was praised in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
There's a different person from Roseanne's fat.
John was glad that his friends and family had asked him to get lost because his big body caused the breakup of the furniture.
"I lost everything in my mouth," said the actor in 2018 in the interview for AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, practice.
I get to the age when I can't afford to sit on the spot anymore, said for ABC Goodman, whose change is amazing.
It also matters what boss and what you want to use the word "boss."
If it's any text on a platform that's expecting a player from a gaming environment, I wouldn't be over it at all.
If it were a formal text and a university text, I'd probably be looking for a better description or explanation.
There's more than one kind of boss for everything.
Maybe the game like Dark Souls etc. has some bosses that yeah, and so there's "boss" something like a master / ruler at the level, and then there's a final boss...
In many games there are hiding bosses (super bosses, hidden bosses), who do not need to defeat at all to complete the game or level, but often are even stronger than standard bosses.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player doesn't run with them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they're kind of called?
Well, then they're mini bosses.
It's simply one way to translate the boss simply doesn't work, the Czech and the other languages don't solve it somehow (I think it's just a Catalan who translates the boss as a final opponent).
It is a short story or game generally important, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and monitoring completion of some level or task.
After the missing Peter from London, four worlds.
The Czech police also joined.
After the missing Peter Srnc's fourth British police since 3 December.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
This 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišk has been looking for her since December 7.
At the same time, the Interpol is helping the British police.
Czech Peter Srnch saw her colleagues last November 28th.
The British police have been looking for her since December 3.
Interpol gave her a so-called yellow ring.
After Peter, the whole world is gone.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," police spokesman Katerín Randlova confirmed.
"We share information with the case," she added.
The reported search for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, it is 168 centimeters high, it is soft and has smooth eyes and long equal hair of the same color.
She's supposed to come from Uherkogradička.
Peter worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues worry about her, such disappearance is very unusual for her
After Peter's trial, the deputy Harriet Harman was also involved.
She joined Peter's face-to-face flight.
"We are very worried about her," she said at the Saturday press conference.

But it's not clear who he was talking about and what he had with Petra.
Pre-Natural Czechs are terrorizing Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, the recent month with the coming year’s end of the attack significantly increased.
A big campaign in relation to Agent Tesla was on November 18.
The attacks are aimed at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for the time being.
The infected Annex in the e-mail shall raise the user's attention to the name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month had a dangerous annex in the name of the invoice, this time it was marked as a copy of the repair of the account for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of Esset.
Spyware contains functions that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook email clients, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The harmful code is actively searching for stored login data that subsequently sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic in the fall of August and September, and with the coming celebrations and the end of the year the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, Spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, attackers in this case do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November have captured more global campaigns.
Compared to the October data formbook in November slightly weakened, but still stands as a constant five of all detections.
The attacks took place continuously throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
Formbook contained the most common annex with .exe, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
But the name of the account continues to appear.
The annex in Czech may then be far more dangerous for the Czech user.
Significant decreases and decreases in activity show security analysts in the Fareit programme, which stood at 1.6 per cent of attacks and in the Czech Republic for the last few months had no greater attack campaign.
Today's smart demo, they don't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated assholes.
The Prague route was bigger than the media reported.
According to the photographs of the coast and my experience of the demonstrator, I don't fear the estimate of about 10,000 people.
The people in the pipeline filled both the bridge and the opposite coast communication.
That means people really are a lot.
Approximately four thousand demonstrators are spontaneously added to the unknown number of roundabouts.
I'm saying there's something new born here, says Radek Wekry.

Only the anti-ruminants, the anti-ruminants and the sex... would not be able to fill in or pay for this.
The action of the Chcípl dog has a rise in popularity, which reminds me of the Million moment for the democracy of the disorder.
Sometimes I feel like they're renting the same stage and technique.
It's hard to say what a move would be to pay for this dissatisfaction, not only depends on the movement of money, but also on whether a three-dose Pfizer vaccine will not be four or more doses.
It's definitely not going to be left-handed or middle-handed, so sit down.
The triad vaccine will almost certainly become a multiplicative because it is clear that we will have to let ourselves be overlooked every half year.
I'm so glad the vaccines saved us.
The brilliant action of scientists, on which humanity is proud.

In Britain over the weekend, concerns about the 32-year-old fate of the Czechs grew, followed by four days of the London police.
Petra Srncová was last watched two weeks when she was driving from home to the southern British metropolis.
According to information about a child hospital worker, she calls in addition to the police and her current employer or deputy representative of London where she lived.

In Ústí nad Laba, the moon wants a hole in the road in the form of a channel without a roof.
It's about life.
The magistrate referred complaints to the RUSD that belonged to the road, and because it had not been answered, the door would continue.
