Black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying to find the money for repairs that break down the road network, many start to see the solution in a small black box, which can easily enter your car’s device board.
The devices that follow every mile that the driver eats and transmits this information to the authorities are the core of Washington's controversial efforts and state planning authorities to renew the obsolete US main roads financing system.
In general, informal road design has all of a sudden led to intensive debate and the creation of the most diverse societies.
The libertarians met with groups of ecologists and lobbyed for the government to use these small boxes, which would record the miles and maybe even where you're going – and then use this information to compile the tax.
Tea party's scared.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress can't agree whether to continue, some states are not waiting for anything.
They'll find out how they can move over the next decade to a system where the driver pays for a mile of the road he's going on.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS monitoring, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"It is not about the matter when we can choose too much," said Hasan Ikhrata, Executive Director of the Association of State Administration in Southern California, which plans to start monitoring the kilometres taken by each California motorist in 2025.
It will change the way we pay these taxes.
That's what this technology is for.
It is therefore the fact that the Road Trust Fund financed from the taxes paid by the Americans at the pumping stations is at the bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
The cars will spend a lot more miles on one gallon.
The federal tax alone, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the last 20 years.
Because of the current high price of petrol, politicians are able to raise taxes only by a single cent.
"The tax on petrol is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this payment system for a stolen kilometre.
"In the long term, this seems to be the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the number of kilometres taken.
It is no surprise that this idea is liked by urban liberals because taxes can be used to change drivers' behaviour patterns, which can, for example, help limit traffic congestion and greenhouse gas generation.
California designers look at this system in planning strategies to meet the objectives set out in the ambitious global warming laws.
But the Republican Bill Shuster (representative of Pennsylvania), president of the Committee on Transport, said that he also saw it as the most functional and long-term alternative.
Free market representatives from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to think that drivers will be paid for miles.
"It's not a tax that disappears in a black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice President of the Reason Strategy.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who in 2011 urged Congress to pay for a kilometer payment.
Last year the US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project, which would include about 10,000 cars.
However, the management of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing the people, whose daily life often means hurting many kilometres outside the city.
However, several states and cities move forward on their own.
The most famous is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying taxes for miles, instead of gas taxes.
The pilot project has already been completed.
New York is just examining the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent in freight cars.
And coalitions I-95, which include 17 state transport ministries, together with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), are studying how they can implement this change.
This concept, however, does not have a backbone.
In Nevada, where the device had recently equipped about 50 cars of volunteers, the driver was concerned that the government was able to monitor each of their movements.
"The concerns of monitoring Big Brother and similar issues were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who runs the management of the strategy and operation at the Nevaska Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the pilot project continued, the American Union of Civil Liberties in Nevada warned on its websites: “It would be very easy to turn these facilities into a necessary monitoring facility.”
There is no need to build a hugely complex technological infrastructure that is being expanded to record daily departures and arrivals of individuals.
The problem is between a number of states that are trying to find the available technology, which would allow the state to monitor how many kilometers of the car is to be hired, but not exactly when and where.
If you can, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
Hon introduced some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
This company was not involved in the government’s action to help tax drivers.
She wanted to go through the emerging market to ensure legal responsibility where drivers would pay on the basis of how much they ate.
But this device that tests attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and only provides a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
"People will be more willing to go unless you follow their speed and position," says Ryan Morrison, executive director True Mileage.
A number of major errors occurred in some of these pilot programs.
There are much cheaper and less efficient ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose a device with GPS or without GPS.
Or they do not have to take any equipment and instead they will decide to pay a flat fee based on the average number of kilometres taken by all the inhabitants of the State.
In other places, they hope that a careful public will adapt to this concept if the device is able to do more, not less.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop tax facilities that would be equipped to pay charges at parking hours to provide insurance per km taken and to collect data on the speed of other drivers so that drivers can avoid traffic congestion.
"The motorists will be willing to take part in this because of the value of the benefits offered to them," the city's projection document states.
Some transport designers, however, would like to know if all the discussions on pay per kilometer are not just a huge problem.
Officials of the Metropolitan Committee for Transport in the San Francisco Bay area say that Congress could easily solve the problem with the bankruptcy of the Road Trust Fund by an increase in petrol tax.
A single or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid or other vehicles that do not need a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgery when you have enough to take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the legislative and public affairs committee.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
ČSSD is negotiating Saturday.
Social democracy is talking to fools, people and grandmothers together and learning a common procedure.
If the social democrats are seen within a few weeks, they will be sitting at the negotiating table with perfectly well-established partners, who will put on the table a list of requirements including ministerial posts.
The ČSSD envoys will then be able to either add acid to the coalition threat, or move on to the garden minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka was first attacked after four days when he was on the wave of sympathies.
Yesterday he was not promised to control the political crime and to bring the convicted liars to resignation.
Only he or she shall be confirmed by the negotiator so far, the other members of the team shall be allowed until after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CSC).
I apologized to the members of the jury and now to the citizens.
He doesn't lie, in his personal life, in the public.
"It was a mistake," said Michael Hasek after the discussion of the deeper leadership of social democracy.
He added that he didn't want to be the first vice president.
"I'll make my decision on November 10th," Hasek said.
Similarly, ČSSD Vice-President Zdeněk Škromak and Head of Missionary Club Jerome Tejc spoke.
However, he warned that he was elected only two days ago.
Both Members then declared that they would do everything to make the 50-year-old ČSSD sound one voice.
To the absurd theatre he planted the crown of Michal Hasek with the sentence: "I am a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to her brand and I have respected the decision of the party authorities."
Chili's another lie in direct transmission.
Or did he forget, when he called for Sobotko's resignation and his withdrawal from the negotiating team, that August UVV had 57 per cent of them, that Bohuslav Sobotka was a candidate for the prime minister?
The chief of ČSSD, however, made a strong enemy army by sending UVV to the next Sunday.
Its opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media of the most diverse drums and fam, possibly recalling the real errors of Sobotkov's political career.
There will be a lot of dirty laundry, there will be signs of dark connections between Zdeňke Bacal and Sobotk's wing.
The friendly relationship of Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radko Pokorno will be discussed.
There are disputes in the Yugoslav or Moravian-Sleslean organisation of the ČSSD.
The words of the island prime minister and Sobotkov's associate Peter Kainara are cautioned: "I signed Charter 77 so that the countries do not control the idiots."
If UVV met this weekend, the liars would probably be forced to sacrifice their functions ritually.
The traitors will shake their heads with ashes and stay.
And the currently winning head of ČSSD will then end with the nickname Bohuslav Pirrha.
Martin Doctor about problems with OH in Soči: Communication with Russia is demanding
The eyes of his mouth indicate an inconvenient smile, and then he'll just breathe out deeply, "It's challenging."
Working with the organization team of the Olympics in Sochi 2014 is a bit more complicated, according to Martin Doctor.
We can forget about what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work slower and not exactly.
It's so confusing.
In terms of invoices, they are relatively fast, from the point of view of providing information on basic matters not so much.
Maybe we've been waiting three months for them to add to us how to officially label individual villages so that we can do a whole series of things.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating.
They keep communicating in a number of things.
Is there at least a delivery of the Olympic Village?
But it's no longer a catastrophic situation.
A month ago, we walked through empty rooms.
Good luck with the house.
What does it mean they're empty?
Are the floors ready?
Just the basic concrete, so that's how it was a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there's a danger that when we get there on the 26th of January as a front, it'll still feel the glue.
And if they didn't make it, then what?
President Putin, would you think he'd get an army there?
That's what I think it's gonna happen.
Just so it won't be that the Olympic village = the descendants of the village.
They're more at risk of not getting a road change, for example, not getting details.
Maybe they'll have roads in such a condition that we'll have to take a holina from the London games.
But I believe they're kind of giving it to the store.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there's about 78 of them, although depending on the nomination criteria, the number changes.
Maybe the Krassovers are going in the three that they've gone out.
No one has to doubt about Martin Sáblík's fast brewer, but otherwise it's in progress.
Still waiting for you on your way to Sochi?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
We know what houses in the Olympic Village look like.
We even measured some things ourselves so that we wouldn't believe only the charts.
We're also preparing a whole series of other things, including transportation.
And what does the Head of Mission do a hundred days before the Olympics?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus making a regular agenda for communication with the Soči organizational committee.
Putin promised the ecological Olympics, the plan to hate him a huge secret puzzle.
Winter sports fans are already cutting the meter to launch Olympic games in Soči, while others are increasingly concerned about their preparation.
The Russian Olympics, if it starts in February, it's dealing with another scandal.
According to all, the Russians are not able to fulfill the promise that the preparations and performance of the games will not be affected by the nature of the country in Krasnodar, at the foot of the Kavkaz, where in four months thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will be targeted.
Most of the time, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had a very high-ranking summer, Canadian games recorded themselves in the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
It seems, however, that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to organize the games with "zero waste" has long since taken place.
Reporters of the AP agency discovered a large building material facility in the village of Achtyr near Sochi last week.
Thus, the bottle filled with building materials, pneumatics, canisters and insulating foams was found in August, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities are out of tea and the bottle is gone.
Just for a moment.
Last week, the reporters were given an overview of the three football games.
She's not the only one, in the area of places like this, has created several, wrote the British newspaper The Times.
The site is operated by Russian railways, a state monopoly, which builds about 16 kilometres between Soči airport and a sports resort.
The company, which already had 280 billion rubles, led one of the close Putin co-workers Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railways defended that the warehouse had been set up by one of the subcontractors.
But the locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achthyr, all around three months of the day and night they've been driving truckloads full of waste.
According to experts, waste threatens to contaminate the local river of Smith, other rivers, and finally the Black Sea.
"The water from here pollutes soch water streams for the next ten to fifteen years," said Vladimir Kimaev of the EWNC environmental non-profit organization.
Illegal assets are not the only problem of the Russian Organizational Committee and Government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
To compare: The games in Soci will cost $51 billion, while the annual Beijing Olympics in 2008 have risen to 43 billion.
Last year's games in London stood only 19 billion and the so-called Vancouver Nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns, if there is to be enough snow, there have also been reports that human rights are not respected when working on sports and infrastructures.
Last month one of the workers put his mouth on a protest that he didn't get two months paid.
Many also fear that Russian organizers will break a new law banning the promotion of homosexuality during the game.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
A young couple grew up living with their parents, a new house offers private to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given the task of designing a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, with the very land being somewhat narrow.
The requirement continued that two generations live together in the house, but each should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly cold ground.
The architects therefore decided to place each house into one of the floors of the house.
"When designing the project, we respected family ties, history and memories associated with the site."
"The three different functions of the house are connected several roads through the exterior of the object, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but they have their own privacy," the designers explained.
The home of parents is at the level of the garden with an old borovica, to which family traditions and memories apply.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, which is different from the final editing of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is of concrete, the surface of which was designed using panels from the ceiling, the part where the office is, is rejected white and the remaining elements remain in clean concrete implementation without any further adjustments.
Many walls of the house are completely paved, which makes the interior of the house very connected to the exterior.
The home of parents, more precise kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The connection of the interior with the exterior is submerged by a side wall that starts in the garden and continues until the dwelling.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enter the house with the main entrance to the hall and then walk up the stairs into their space.
It's just that the damage is the main dominant of the interior of the house.
Their design allows them to destroy a lot of natural light through their cascade.
This is exactly what the architects were trying to distinguish the house from the others and print it something unique.
The home of a young couple is arranged as an open space with a kitchen, dining room and living together.
From the terrace, it's only a glass wall with a sliding door.
The living area with a dining and kitchen area in the home of a young couple.
The second pattern is composed as one large open space that passes freely on the terrace, from which is a nice view of the Tokyo River.
The single office at the highest level is captured in a clean combination of white and black.
The vault is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enter the house with the main entrance, they feel in the entrance hall and from there they step up the stairs.
Defend academic freedoms, it pays for Zeman and ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called for open letters from students, educators and seniors in a number of countries to defend academic freedoms from the election campaign conducted by President Milos Zeman at the schools.
I've met with more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused to give a speech by the Honorary President SPOZ-Zemanovci during the pre-election period, even received an invitation to a public ceremony in the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of representatives of schools who have not been so fixed and who have made it possible to visit Milos Zeman: High Technical Learning in Brno, Gymnázium Hladnov in Ostrava, High Business School in Ostrava, Business Academy in Cologne, University of J.E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Lab.
We now meet in Pardubice with the continuation of policy promotion at high schools.
The newly elected MP for the ODS, the Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computers of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic function and also seems normal.
Professor, it's really not the same as if you stayed for example in the mayor's office of the smaller city.
Do you want to join the ČSSD hetmans who are currently performing the functions of MPs and hetmans and the same as they are degrading both appointments?
That's what you're saying to people that they can handle both of these demanding functions on the left.
I know, here's the example of Michal Haška, who manages even several dozens of functions at once.
But it's probably not exactly the person you should drive.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánky Frankova, who prefers to leave the post so that she can fully devote herself to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the function of the dean is that during the course of the functions, you disrupt the apostolicity of the academic soil of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the pardubic ODS sees your current action on both posts as an advantage to the University.
But your "your" school will be able to help you without staying a thank you.
I think the same opinion as I and Rector Miroslav Ludwig will have your students.
So consider your resignation and maintain your face.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that the voters will count on you in future elections.
And it doesn't have to last long.
In the Kunovice bubbles, the chemistry doesn't add to it.
More than a thousand tons of acidified herbs want to be produced in the coming months in the Slovak Fruit of Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé.
The season here began in October and will last about a half year.
A healthy appetite here since 1925 is still produced in a traditional way, i.e. by smoking directly in large dances.
In modern industrial times, it's about rarity.
Our staff found a trail for the change of almost ten kilometre route.
In each of the ten tanks there will be fifteen to thirty tons of green, filling one takes three shifts," said the director of the Slovak Frut David Kladoba race.
The seed heads drive directly from their fields to farmers mainly from Ostrožska and Břclavska.
The employees of Fruity then clean the vegetables, remove the Costs and throw them into the roundabout.
From there, the already planted grass falls into the pools of six-foot deep, where the tires of white clothing and hooligans work tirelessly.
That's what makes the air uncomfortable.
The last layer of green will be covered with a coat and weighs water.
"The green round then shows up to six to eight weeks for spontaneous milking without any add-on of supportive chewing substances," said Director Kladrob.
The natural process corresponds to the production under domestic conditions, the individual layers of workers proliferate with salt and seeds.
The green after extraction travels to the filling line.
It is contained in a sugarcane into bags or bottles and is treated with sterilisation.
Hame is supplying acidified oils primarily on the domestic and Slovenian markets.
The interest is also registered in some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to "co-operate" with Germany in relation to US surveillance
Edward Snowden, an American reporter, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to give the German Parliament evidence if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander would not be able to provide answers to questions about his activities.
German Member Hans-Christian Strübele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum and discussed the possibility of witnessing in Germany.
In a letter from Mr Snowden, who delivered the press on Friday in Berlin, he said: "Although the result of my efforts has been manifestly positive, the government continues to act as a fugitive and is trying to criminalize political demonstrations with heavy complaints that do not give room for defence."
It's not a crime to tell the truth.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the Government of the United States to bring charges against it from criminal acts.
The charges imposed by the United States Ministry of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said about Time Online magazine: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible."
The tension between the U.S. and Germany began to subside when the fact that the NSA was listening to the phone of the office officer, Angela Merkel, appeared.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who is leading a parliamentary panel that is watching the news, said that if it were any chance to hear Mr Snowden as a witness "without putting himself in danger and completely destroying his relationship with the United States", it should be done.
Mr Strebele, a parliamentary member of the German Green Party, published a photo on his Twitter contribution with Mr Snowden.
On their way to Russia, two German journalists accompanied him.
Mr. Strebele said that according to former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr Snowden had testified in Germany, he would need assurance that he would be "safe," a member of parliament said.
Mr. Snowden in his letter said he was facing a harsh and persistent campaign associated with the persecution that forced him to leave home.
He said, however, that the world's reaction to his "political expression" added courage to him.
Citizens of all and senior officials, including those in the United States, have assessed the detection of an unwarranted system of universal monitoring for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities to "resolve the difficulties of this humanitarian situation."
Killing us is a pity, but we're innocent. The Red Khmers are fighting.
Nuon Chea was number two in the hierarchy of the Red Khmers and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
For the Government of the Red Khmer, which was based in 1975 to 1979 on a mixture of mosaics and nationalism, life came as a result of extermination, hunger, disease, torture and correction of more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of the population then.
Tomuto, the unrecognised commander of the S-21 prison, awarded the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia a life sentence in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, slander and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan were shocked by believing that they acted in the best interests of the people and did not know what the real extent of the killing is.
"It's easy to say that I should know everything, understand everything, and then touch and correct the situation," Khieu Samphan told the court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea stated that he had never ordered the Red Khmer camp to "behave badly with people or kill them to resist food or commit genocide".
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to apologize sincerely to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all Cambodian people," he said.
Fifteen-year-old Bin Sivla, who became eleven relatives of the Red Khmer regime, said the AFP agency could not accept Nuon Chea's apology."
"He lied to us."
"He only wants to be released from guilt."
"She doesn't care about the second," she said.
"If he hadn't issued orders, they wouldn't have killed him," she added, "the leaders of the Red Khmer are worse than the monster."
He was also to be a foreign minister of the Red Khmer regime Ieng Sary, who died this year in March.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, in September 2012 the court found an inability trial for dementia.
The leader of the Red Khmer Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to pay the manual luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge an amount of up to USD 100 for the deposit of a handbag on board during its years.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 per hand luggage and $2 per cup of coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday they said that passengers will be able to leave the whole case.
The new fee for the hand luggage relates to the luggage in the top spare space, so the small luggage under the seat will still be free.
Frontier says it will charge 25 USD if the fee is paid in advance, and 100 USD if the passengers are to wait with the payment until the arrival of the gate.
Frontier Kate O'Malley's speech company stated that a hundred dollar fee should encourage the traveler to take care of the payment in advance.
"We would hate to choose this fee," she said.
The airlines started to apply the first and second commitments in 2008.
Travelers tried to avoid these fees and stuck in handbags hidden in the spare space as much as they could, so there was often a lack of space in this space.
Fees are one way of teaching passengers to get less things on board.
O'Malley said the point of this new fee really isn't to get more money.
The point is that Frontier's most trusted customers have made it quite clear that finding a place in the top spare space is still more difficult.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the company's website will not pay.
This means that one passenger on the front at Frontier's gate can bring a deposit for which he pays nothing, while the other passenger on the front will pay $100 for the same deposit.
O'Malley said that websites and procurement procedures would be adjusted in such a way as to ensure that passengers would learn about the fee before coming to the gate.
The new Frontier fee for the handbag will not yet be valid before the summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Travelers often complain about charges for luggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of the undertaking is worth the money, and passengers who demand this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street receive another fee for the deposit as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the costs of air traffic after the loss of the years.
Most of the charges for handbags were not met.
Spirit Airlines was the first to apply the manual baggage three years ago and another Allegiant Air low-cost company followed its example later.
The only company that also has such fees is the Hungarian Visa Air, says the airline advisor Jay Sorensen, who is closely monitoring additional charges.
In its December 2011 report, Spirit estimated that the fee for the handbags would be US$ 50 million annually.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines employee, recently flew to Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when the passengers met with an unusual payment of Spirit as a handbag.
"The approach to the plane was the fastest I've ever seen in my flight career," he said.
I was waiting to see a toothpaste and a fight at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the show was in the man's head."
Frontier also uses Spirit to pay for coffee, tea, soda and juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who get lemonade or juice can leave the whole canister and the coffee will be added for free.
The water will continue to be given free of charge.
In 2008, US Airways recently tried to introduce a fee for drinks, but after complaints from passengers seven months later, it was stopped and no other significant airline caught it.
The last move of Frontier to pay the handbag if the passengers do not buy flights directly from this airline is its last effort to direct customers directly to its website.
Air carriers pay online travel sales, such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD for each air ticket sold.
This has enabled all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of doing so through internet travel agencies.
However, Frontier's company went further in this area.
In September, she began giving customers who bought via the Internet travel agency only half a mile within the framework of the loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she made a 25 per cent-mile salary for the hit mile from the road.
So the journey with Frontier is 1000 miles long purchased through the internet travel agency means a 250 miles reward.
Customers also allow the company to select its seat in advance only if they purchase directly through Frontier’s website.
Frontier has a reliable customer base in its home town of Denver, but its business begins to bleed and lose money.
According to the financial results reported in the mid-term by the company partner Republic Airways Holdings, the markets fell by 9 per cent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter.
The company of the Republic is also trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier for the sale of this airline.
For the fall of the NSA's website, hackers are not guilty, but "internal error"
The Secret National Security Agency stated last Friday that its websites fell for several hours last week due to internal failure, not due to the attack of hackers, as some have claimed on the Internet.
“NSA.gov’s pages were not available this evening for several hours due to an internal error that occurred during regular updates,” the Spanish agency stated in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be removed during the evening.
The claim that the accident was caused by the DDoS attack (distributed refusal of services) is not true.
Earlier this evening, on-line servers recorded that NSA websites did not work for at least six hours, and sites are still unavailable for some users.
Previously, the NSA spokesperson at ABC News reported that the internal sensitive networks of the agencies were not "at all" at risk.
The speaker said that no hidden information was compromised.
At least one group of online hackers claimed to be responsible for eradicating NSA sites through the DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until servers cross and the site falls.
This cybernetic tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA super-secretary agency, which once received the nickname No such agency, has become a result of the discovery of foreign and domestic monitoring programmes in the middle of public attention and the intense criticism of the total product of removing secret NSA files from the agency and expressing them to the distraught former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the Agency prompted a previous speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cybernetic operation.
The profit of Bombardier was lost as a result of the decrease in supplies and orders
Canadian aircraft and trains manufacturer Bombardier reported a 15 per cent decrease in net profit on Thursday, due to a smaller number of orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter and to the contractual problems of the train unit.
The company Bombardier also did not disclose any data on the flight test for its new CSeries aircraft in Montreal, nor did it offer up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft will comply with the ambitious plan to start commercial operations from the next September.
After the initial test flight, about a month and a half of the plane only flew three times, and the question arises whether the test phase is doing well.
The results did not meet the estimates and the stock exchange in Toronto declined by 8 percent.
The State Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen reduced the rating on Thursday from "high performance" to "sector performance" with the expectation that the stock exchange will experience limited growth during the next quarter or two.
"As much as we expected the smaller deliveries of aircraft, we were greatly disappointed by the profit margin in the area of transport," Doerksen told the customers in the report.
As the pilot program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders from CSeries.
However, if no new orders will be notified in the coming months, we assume that the market growth towards this programme will increase.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will enter the sub-area of the market that now dominates Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was discovered in March and the first flight took place after a few months of delay in September.
However, the number of mandatory orders for CSeries is limited to 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the pilot flight in order to verify the company's claims concerning low consumption and savings on the costs of this aircraft.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach its 300 mandatory orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
The leaders also assured the analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme is in line with the plan.
"The pilot aircraft did not remain on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call and noted that the ground tests and software updates were planned during the flight's departure.
Every manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to graduate the first year and then focus on updating, and we did.
It's going to happen during the entire flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test planes should be taken in the coming weeks and the other not long afterwards.
The analysts are skeptical, however, that the first customer could start operating the CSeries 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier argues that it has assessed its flight plan and provides updated information in the following months.
“This slow pace of flight tests – although in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – is likely to reinforce our view that the introduction will be moved to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
Of USD 172 million or 9 cents per share in the previous year, the net profit of Bombardier fell to USD 147 million, or 8 cents per share, at the end of the third quarter of September.
The adjusted yield for one share remained unchanged for 9 cents.
The trend has decreased marginally from USD 4.2 billion to USD 4.1 billion.
According to the IBES system Thomson Reuters analysts expected the profit of 10 cents per share and turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer stated that compared to 57 aircraft a year earlier, only 45 aircraft were added during the quarter.
Clean orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled air traffic orders amounted to 32.9 billion by 30 September, which does not change until 31 December.
"The results in aviation were in line with our prospects, but the low receipt of orders and the overall market situation disappointed us," Beaudoin said.
In the aviation industry, income decreased by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said that the profit in this division increased by almost 11 per cent to US$ 2.1 billion.
Infringements in transport amounted to 32.6 billion by 30 September, which is against 31 December of marginal growth.
The distribution of revenue in the transport division has been affected by problems with the implementation of several major contracts.
The managers indicated that new prospects would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced the income of the financial director of Google Patrick Pichette, dropped by 8.5 per cent on Thursday afternoon during the business.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the closest competitor of Bombardier, announced a 10 per cent quarterly profit loss on Thursday.
The lawyer, who is dependent on cocaine, who warned the mob before the police investigation, is in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) was to transmit the information to the king of the sub-world of Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was afraid his drug addiction would come out.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
The tipper who informed the drug mob about a major police investigation because he was afraid that his drug addiction would come out, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) had, after becoming suspected of cocaine use, provided sensitive information to the chief of the world's subspecies of Neil Scarbrough on the investigation of his drug-supply activities.
A lawyer whose nickname was "Bash" (party) who was criminally celebrated as the best legal representative was arrested at home in 2011.
The police watched Sarborough (32), leaving at the lawhouse in Blackburn in Lancashire, which was just for dinner with his colleagues from the Law Society, three bags of cocaine.
Based on the tests in which cocaine levels were found in his hair, his money and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular drug user of Class A.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he tried diligently to obtain information about the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborough and his partner.
All four suspects were then monitored in the context of a major investigation into trafficking in heroin and cocaine in the Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire areas.
After the police detained heroin and cocaine in a series of seizures worth GBP 1.5 million with GBP 200,000 in cash, another 32 people ended up in prison with them.
Ditta (42) handed out information to the criminals, fearing that it would be dependent on cocaine.
Today Ditta, who works at Forbes Solicitors' legal company based in Blackburn, experienced a shameful moment before the Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty of defending justice in two cases after a three-week count.
During the previous hearing, he admitted to holding cocaine.
The lawyer was born after a police investigation in Scarborough found that he was in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and watched him put 60 percent of the drugs clean under lawyers' basket in the black golf cart.
Next he was Scarborough with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer returned home where the drugs were found, and nine conversations were held between the two.
In the court, it was announced that there were traces of Class A drugs in his hair, money and credit cards and that Ditta was "a regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but the use of cocaine denied, and said that he spoke to a suspect dealer because he was his client, and argued that their conversation was a "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to get several credit cards out of it, but all of them were detained and his hair samples were taken.
In a police investigation, he said that he was operating a office both at his home address and at his workplace, and that his clients were visiting him on business matters at home.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted important players in the drug supply chain, some of which he had previously represented, to tell them what detectives know about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "Who else is aware that he must not violate the law than the legal representative in the criminal field."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a legal representative and of getting into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his interviews were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal relationship of a client lawyer.
The police investigation dreamt how much he could allow them to continue in their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not bring his profession of good reputation, but he insulted it.
With some of his clients he got too close, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be disrupted.
Detta refused and declared: "If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and I wanted to inform Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately."
However, after hearing the police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: "Mr. Ditta became a criminal himself at the time he began to get drugs from organised criminals."
Its dependence on cocaine has made it hopelessly weak and vulnerable to the intentions of the pre-representatives of organised crime groups, which have commissioned him to collect valuable information on police investigation.
Legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and must in public incite confidence and feel that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide himself behind the plate of his profession.
The unit for serious and organised criminal offences in Lancashire led against Mr. Ditt's investigation, on the basis of which he was also convicted for three cases of cocaine possession and now for preventing the execution of justice, which demonstrates our obligation to bring the criminals before the court.
This case should serve for all criminals as a warning that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and stand before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being convicted of collaborating for the purpose of supplying heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another thirty-five people involved in trafficking were imprisoned for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website Ditta arranged an online interview about himself, saying that his dream work would be lawful to represent clients from the death block in America, as a guest at dinner he would wish Mohammed Ali and as a motivation for the work he would introduce injustice.
He discussed the government with Klaus and Špidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasal sent against Babish.
In the election of fourteen Members, the people received only a third of the number of social Democrats or representatives of the United Nations.
But they enter into a government negotiation with at least one advantage.
In a team that has already begun to guess the drawings of possible coalitions, Jana Kasala - a man who made the conditions for government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002, and 2006.
Social Democrats and Andrej Babish don't have such a matador on their side.
It will probably be remembered this time for the first negotiation in 1992 when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"Experience was minimal then," Kasal estimates how the talks this year will develop.
Kenyan press under controversial media law
"It is a scary report and it is on the spot to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply not breaking the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," the newspaper quoted the bill as anti-constitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Director-General of the Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of the most prominent independent advertising stations and reporting websites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be precipitated because it is an extended government arm" and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Keni's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will hear us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the Members," he said.
According to the Star Journal, the bill actually transmits "full control over the media" to the government, and Standard newspaper states that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya have "stained a hard wound" and criticises the bill as "strong".
The adoption of the bill comes in the middle of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack of the Islamic shooter at the Westgate Shopping Centre.
The Kenyan media turned their wrath on themselves by sending a security camera to which soldiers allegedly needed a luxury trade.
The police director responded that he had two journalists and the head of the media to the interview, but the interview was later downloaded after the press.
According to the new draft law, media companies can be harassed by up to 20 million Kenyan Shillings and individual journalists with one million at the risk of "disposal of the list" or can be denied official press accreditation.
The Tribunal shall also have the right to entertain the property of the defendant if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “there is also one way to eliminate most of the advertising stations.”
It is also noted that these measures may have an impact on what is called the Kenyan "living blogosphere".
Politicians know that when they shut up the media, they can do what they want without fear.
"You never know what can happen," wrote National Mutum Mathiu newspaper and described Kenyan media as the key source of the system of mutual control and balance in public life.
"When we leave this on politics, they will bring the country to bankruptcy and throw us back to hunting and collecting," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya were in the past criticizing the public.
In May, they voted for the abolition of the cuts of the national wage agency and for the restoration of their fat salaries of around 532,000 untaxed silks monthly, which is the highest in the world.
He's got to burn himself, he knows young Czechs.
Most of them don't even know what they're up to.
More and more Czechs give their money to the side.
However, they do not belong to champions in the region.
The most money by the side is stored by the Rakušan, which burns monthly on average 181 euros.
About something more than the Czechs burn people in Slovakia.
This results from the Erste Savings Barometer survey in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of the guards is improving, and two thirds of the respondents are planning to give themselves more money.
While the Czechs are close to the middle of the guard’s plate, in Romania and Serbia, people still consume very little.
For example, almost every other Serb will burn at home under the pillow, according to the survey.
In Germany this year, the number of those who spend a month on higher amounts has risen.
Every month more than 2,000 to 2.5 thousand crowns of 26 percent of respondents, this year it's five percent more.
The average monthly investment in the year-to-year comparison has decreased slightly to 2078 crowns.
The biggest hit among the combustion products is pension insurance.
This predates 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to assess savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the structure of the construction facility decreased, and the investment funds were also significantly lost last year.
You're only using 16 percent of the respondents, while last year it was almost a quarter of the people.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to burn, most of them do not know how much they earn on individual products.
First of all, young people under 30 don't know how their money is paid.
On the contrary, the best awareness of the benefits of its savings has the oldest group of respondents, among people over the age of 50, 73 percent of those questioned.
In the international comparison of the Erste Česi group, they lead to the use of online banking, which regularly uses 44 per cent of people.
The following are Slovaks and Rakušána with a 12 per cent discount.
The UN celebrates new goals of combating poverty
The United Nations is beginning to work immediately on a new set of goals that replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) introduced 12 years ago to address global poverty.
Before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in the launch of "sustainable development goals", which are to replace the MDG, whose validity expires in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Mr. Ki-mun said at the summit that now is the time to "take a stand over national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process, which is intended to establish the general objectives of sustainable development – SDG," he said.
SDGs will build on the progress achieved under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development programme.
I make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to realize our vision of the objectives of sustainable development, which builds on the success of the MDG.
Mozambique's security concerns are escalating because of the conflict of strong personalities
Under the sochoa Samory Makely, the Mosamby President of the founder, thousands of people met in the center of Maputa to practice peace passwords on rare public demonstrations.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
Out of fear of the future of its country, the company's clothes were replaced by a shirt decorated with the inscription "we demand security" in Portuguese and added to the gift on Thursday at the Place of Independence in the main city.
After two weeks, reports of conflicts between the government and the party of Renamo came almost daily, about one of the worst flows from the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notoriously well-known rebel, originally supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then the government of the apartheid in South Africa in an effort to destabilize the independent government of that country.
After the 1992 Peace Agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that an open conflict will erupt again in the country, but recent events have prompted foreign investors and locals.
The economy is fast growing, as the discovery of extensive coastal reserves of oil and coal deposits in the north-west can be brought over several years by companies such as Brazil's Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy's Eni and the American Anadark, investments worth more than $50 billion.
Frelimo's ruling party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension that has arisen.
The Renamo party claims that the government caused the last conflicts by initiating an attack on their members in the province of Sofala, the traditional village of the Renamo Party on 17 September.
The violent attacks of the former rebels followed when government forces attacked on the basis of Renamo and tried to kill Afons Dhlakam, the leader of the group, said to the Financial Times spokespersons of Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government accuses Renamo of leaving the conflicts, because he's been attacking the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuz was trying to ease the fears of instability.
Mr. Guebuza for the French press office AFP said on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as a "consumer", who wanted to use "everything left of his strength to try to prove that the government could make its own decisions".
Like Frelimo, Renamo claims they want to avoid war.
However, concerns grew when Mr. Mazangy was quoted as saying that the Renamo side is derogating from the 1992 peace agreement.
The FT letter said that it meant that the Frelimo party no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to the discussion, but with seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
The previous talks between these parties have been made to mitigate the tension between these parties, which have stirred up a number of currents this year, just a little.
It is a charm between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), the lecturer at the Open University and expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon said.
Not one of them is a good negotiator and not one of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who has tried to change the election, has already said that she would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an effort to obtain the benefits and financial benefits of the moving movement from the government.
The electoral share of Renamo has decreased since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by the former member of Renamo, as expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza – whose second functional period ends next year – wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
"The democratic system does not want more sides, does not want transparent elections, does not want peace because it does not want to leave the presidential authority," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options Renamo has, but he has carried out vicious terrorist attacks at the police station and on vehicles on the key roads between the north and the south.
Most of the routes were reached in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometres away from Maputo capital, but where the city of Beirut, the port on which the companies are based, including Rio Tinto and Vale, when they export coal.
In June, Rio suspended for about a week the use of the railway when Renamo threatened to attack this line.
Mr. Mazanga didn't want to comment on whether Renamo was repeating his threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.
Instability has increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, the head of independent media media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and a recent flood of kidnappings.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies exclusively with the government and the president and that he should be the one who will find a solution to the problems," he says.
Demonstrant Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
"No one cares either Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, want free access to the road," he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for the way of life”, says the author.
The stories about Thora can show that “a rough force cannot equal smart estility”, while artus ’ legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
Most of the myths would be "for school education to be too wild, to be too scandalous and in some cases to be too obsessive," said Crossley-Holland, who is referring to a careful choice of age.
"I think it's great that myths and human creation are already part of education," he said.
I've been planning this for 20 years.
He added that “openly instructive” authors and teachers are in the habitual story with “understanding” message for children as “offer”.
Crossley-Holland, who translated from English, Epos Beowulf, and who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Barriers, says: "You can have good intentions, but you will do better if you leave them for yourself."
Perhaps the greatest difference between adult author writing for adults and adult author writing for children is the need for some sense of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or ended with a happy ending, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And he must be aware; revealed through the story, not openly determined.
The old truth is it's better to show than to describe.
Brno's star takes visitors to space in a new digital
At first glance, it is obvious that the large planetary hall has changed in the last half of the year.
There is a new sight, visitors can hide in the new comfortable seats and above their heads came the projection area of an average of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is his most important part, the new projector from Japan.
To be a perfect picture, more smaller projectors are scattered around the hall.
Another important part of the entire facility is hidden behind the hall.
"It's twenty-one computers that generate the image," said the director of the Brno star Jiří Dušek.
Computers will make sure that the image from several projectors is not covered, but given a perfect impression.
"The performance of computers is thirty-four times higher than in classical personal computers," said the star technician Tomáš Hladík.
The digitalium can be an extremely realistic and plastic model of night skyscrapers, human bodies, or the bottom of the ocean.
The viewers are so excited right in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Another similar facility is closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
Star management plans to project purchased order and own design in the room.
There are two series on the program since Saturday.
The first one is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People in it will learn about the training of cosmonauts, the flight into space, cling to the centrifuge, and then see in the visual examples how the conditions of astronauts in the space of the head are challenging.
The second show is for children and has a name of the Cousin Utse - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of Utse, whose pestrocolored inhabitants lived a calm life until the blast of a nearby pine.
The entire digitalium stood at about fifty million crowns, which paid mostly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the star from its budget also contributed a few amounts.
The projection area was ten million crowns, the projector of twelve million.
"The rest of society's audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The digital installation followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the star passed two years ago.
According to Director Duška, 25 to 30 thousand visitors could arrive by the end of the year.
We've been studying 11 people!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis caught over 11,000 advertisements offering jobs, 4300 of which were published in the daily press and 6800 advertisements (62%) online.
The Internet thus becomes the most important media for publishing job offers.
In 2005, when the first research was carried out, it accounted for 26 per cent of its share.
In the last two investigations (2007), approximately 60 percent were established.
Indications of job opportunities in themselves, according to a significant analysis, reflect the current situation on the labour market.
For example, a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published during the economic prosperity period and during the economic crisis may be.
For example, in 2007 nearly 25 900 ads were published in the same follow-up period, which was less than half in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is geared towards a narrower, especially a more qualified group of professionals.
On the contrary, the job offer in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including the workers, the author of the analysis, Pavlín Šhęstnová.
The representation of selected professional groups is different in both media.
On the Internet, the front posts of advertisements sought by managers and managers, trade representatives, programmers and financial experts were impressed.
The position of programmers or managers of small businesses was only on the Internet.
In today’s press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, rather than large representations, especially of formal and professional professions.
Of course, the most frequently cited requirements expressed by employers through the advertising offer are education.
Another area was the knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, a requirement for the knowledge of a foreign language was made in three percent of advertisements, on the Internet in 37 percent.
In just two percent of newspapers, employers demanded the active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for 'computer gravity' were shown in 40 per cent of advertisements (in the daily print in 11 per cent, on the Internet in 57 per cent).
Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
Practice requirements are all linked to qualified professions.
It is particularly about leading production and other leading workers.
In the working professions, in particular, it is about mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and food processors or the repairers of electrical equipment, the author of the Jirí Tillner study.
Employers shall also specify in half their advertisements requirements for the characteristics and skills of the applicants concerned.
The most frequently required skills in the first-place fire have already shown the communication skills for a long time.
In addition, employers require flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, autonomy, responsibility, organisational capacity and reliability.
Ben Greenman: New Yorker's tenth anniversary of New Yorker's Comedy Festival
It could be argued that New York City is the place where solo comic shows were produced in America: almost a hundred years ago, the various artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the assembled people the jokes by means of conversation.
Fay's innovation has expanded over the years, the latest through the New York comedy festival.
The festival, founded and run by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the solo comedy Carolines institution, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – together with more than sixty performances in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the point that they are too big than to play in the club," said Hirschová.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the performance of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the "Stand Up for Heroes" (to be built as heroes), the annual musical comedy performance at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will be broadcast.
Just as this festival expanded, the world of comedy expanded.
Several comics from the festival this year came from non-traditional channels, such as show in smaller broadcasts or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll grew up with his seat (vessel picantín "League" on fantastic football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show at Comedy Central station.
Jenny Slate was a member of both "Saturday night live", and "Parks and recreation", but she celebrated the most rapidly expanding series of videos "Marcel the shell with shoes on" (the Marcel boys in boots).
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comics with clearly recognizable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, a race-oriented W. Kamau Bell), are a product of a decentralised American comedy world.
One of the biggest events in the festival will be the conversation: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he held a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting is held at the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in Larry's comedy DNA all over the job," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks through the street between the two buildings and says, "Man, if I get all the money, maybe I'll live here.
The oil price went down to $96 a barrel.
The oil price on Friday continued to decline as the concerns of the high stocks were offset by a report showing the strengthening of the Chinese industry's energy-laundering industry.
The US oil indicator for December delivery during the late morning dropped by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in European electronic commerce at the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, a decrease of 39 cents was made, and for the month of October, 5.8 percent remained.
The rich oil stocks over the past few weeks have made the price difficult.
The Ministry of Energy announced on Wednesday that US resources have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, the stock increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports on Chinese production led to a greater demand that showed growth in activity.
This means that China's economic recovery could continue to increase by 7.8 per cent in the third quarter after the two weak decades of growth.
Oil Brent, an international oil indicator used also by the American refinery, fell at the London International Trade Exchange of 26 cents for $108.58 per barrel.
Not at all, Mr. Haske.
We have a unique opportunity to show the politicians that they are not.
It is necessary to develop such pressure that Martin Hasek is released from all political functions and has left the MP's mandate.
Any other solution reduces the level of political culture, which is already so mundane.
Martin Hasek is protected by the promise he made, but every policy must in particular be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very carefully what he can promise.
Trust is the only capital that politics has (Mr. Babi has the important one, of course it is the question whether it is politics).
The better program pursued by a liar is unbelievable.
He doesn't apologize in politics, he's retreating in politics.
Mr. Hasku, if you think this is good with this country (and your frequent statements in it determine me, if you just didn't - here you see how it's difficult to lie), you leave politics alone as a man.
Then people will accept your apology as an expression of the man who made a mistake and takes responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be viewed as unpatent weak ones whose words and deeds cannot be trusted.
You want to be proud, be a missing person or a life shadow.
It may seem to you that it is unfair when I speak only to you, but you are indeed a leader and they are only a misdirected sheep.
And you're a leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand that you are now trying to close your ears, reassess your strengths, dissipate the shame and then attack again, but so are the partisans or the subversives.
You're, I repeat, in my eyes the leader, the alpha male, so behave.
Take responsibility and leave politics.
The Court blocked the regulation concerning the procedure for the arrest and search of persons by the NY police department
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal blocked the court regulation requiring changes in the arrest and search programme for persons in the New York police department and the court dismissed the case.
The second U.S. appeal court said that Judge Shiry Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until the decision on the appeal that the city gave.
In August, the judge decided that the city had broken the Constitution so that he had implemented his program of stopping and questioning people.
The city of the police department and its regulations have been called upon, including the decision to grant supervisory oversight, which would help the police department to change its procedures and its educational program associated with them.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the requested postponement on Tuesday.
The referring court said that the judge had to be withdrawn from the case because she had come into conflict with the rules of procedure for the judge, and that as a judge she did not act as required to avoid the opinion of the company, partly because of a series of discussions with the media and a public declaration that she openly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge decided that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they wrongly focused on the blacks and Hispance in their search for persons under their programme.
She established independent oversight to monitor major changes, including reforms in procedures, training and supervision, and ordered the launch of the pilot programme for the purpose of testing cameras carried on the bodies in some areas where the most frequent arrest occurs.
In August, New York agreed to terminate the name-keeping method and address of the people whose cases were refused after the police investigation.
The oral reasons for the withdrawal of the city are sometimes planned after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching persons have criticised a number of civil rights defenders.
In some ways there has been stopping and searching for people for about a decade, but the survey conducted by the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg has dramatically increased to a record number of 684 330 in 2011, in most cases black and Spanish.
In 2004, four men, all of them among the minorities, were registered as a complaint which became the case of a group complaint.
The MAH argues that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police assembly and may affect how these procedures are used by other police departments.
The opponents claim that the changes reduce police morale, but not crime, and that money is being wasted, but that they do not solve a broader problem when the police are under pressure after the last decade has reduced its numbers by a few thousand.
The judge noted that she did not complete the practice of stopping and searching the person who was constitutional, but reformed the way the police department's visits to the NY took place.
Five shopping centers are facing low-visibility
This results from the data of Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In the Prague Bohnics, the public will open the Krakov Business Centre, will be the 19th Prague Shopping Centre.
In the Czech Republic, there are now a total of 90 major shopping centers.
The unsatisfied performance is about 20 percent of the medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are inadequately large center towards locality and bad layout, i.e. too much pattern or complicated and opaque passport arrangements, possibly dead places center," Michal Sotak of Cushman & Wakefield said.
Also, according to the leading retail properties department Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about five malls are facing low visitors.
Among the main reasons are poor transport availability, low income categories of local residents or market overcrowding in a given location.
Some projects have been opened almost fully covered, but their results have been largely unsatisfactory at first.
Today, customers are somewhat conservative and dislike to change their shopping habits.
The new business centre must try more to 'slip' its customers on new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing activities," Samadi added.
According to Sotáka, the size of shopping centres is generally stable, even at some centres, because the tenants were willing to lower the rent and hire some units in the crisis.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently been opened that are not fully occupied and have thus reduced average (e.g. Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouci)," Soták added.
The malls opened in the last two years are being sold on the market according to Sylvie Samadi very slowly.
But there is a place on the market for new projects.
The number of sites suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a space for building a project that would serve the people of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects called 'convinence centres', aimed at purchasing and services of daily needs for residents living in the immediate environment," Samadi said.
According to Sotáka, there is also a place on the domestic market for other shopping centres.
And for the small 'service' centre, for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.
"Citys like Kladno, Czech Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague, you can see the space for the prepared shopping centre in the Winning Square, further, according to him, they have clear street potential on the Příkopě and Václav Square.
"The expansion of retail parks that enable traders to cover and expand to more and more smaller cities for favourable rental and operating costs, the space is also still in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centres, depending on their reconstructions such as the reconstruction of commercial houses Prior, which are of good locality," Dita Kubánkova of the company DTZ added.
In the Czech Republic, 90 modern shopping centres with a total of more than 2.2 million metres of square-storey areas are currently located.
A quarter of all these shopping centers are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, derives from the data of Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is on the EU average, compared to the figures from Britain and France, leaving the Czech Republic about 50 square metres per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson got on the phone to check his tip.
The former editor of news news of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson reportedly used the methods "to get on the phone, monitor and confront" to confirm a subversive type of loving relationship to which the former Minister of Interior Charles Clarke had to be involved.
State Representative Andrew Edis at the Old Bailey Court said that the news of the World caught false news in May 2005 that Clarke was seen with his "an attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The news was entrusted to private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to get into Paulby's voice box and enter into her private room, but it was announced in court that Coulson had called her and left her voice messages.
"The State Representative suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a person standing in front of the house and hoping that people are trapped outside, but a person who likes to hear stories to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He said that the NotW newspapers used three ways of exploring stories: getting on the phone, tracking and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Of course he knows about the second, tracking, he needs to know about it.
What about the first one?
Does she know about getting on the phone?
He says no, we say, "But of course he knows."
The scenes about the loving relationship that Clarke was involved in were first captured by the News News Department, when the source, who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby, was said, "You're wasting your time, it's with Charles."
A record of the voice messages received from her phone on at least three occasions was received at Mulcaira's house in August 2006.
The investigators also found records in the computer of the private investigator, where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were named "Projects".
During the time of Mrs. Paulby's investigation, her cousins received anonymous phone calls requesting information about Paulby, said Edis.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup were watching Mrs. Pawlby's movement.
Coulson left her on 18 June 2005 with a voice message saying, "I got a story that we're going to publish tomorrow and which I would like to talk to Charles very much about."
Mr. Edis says that the involvement of Coulson in the story was according to the same model as in other important personalities, including former Minister David Blunkett.
On Thursday's trial, it was announced that Coulson was confronting Mr. Blunkett for a loving relationship with a married woman, while he himself met with her husband, Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks opposed contact with other people for the purpose of calling from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have confessed to getting on the phone.
The detection of NSA increases the public monitoring paranoia by the State
One day at the end of August, the German police helicopter ran over the US consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
The purpose of the mission was to arrange a photograph of the cover of the US pre-reviewed surveillance, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media argues that BfV hopes that it will be able to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this action has left Berlin an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers.
James Clapper, the US director of national reporting in September, once again insisted that the United States do not use its foreign reporting options "to steal the commercial secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of American companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, who became a co-worker as an informer, has begun to discover his valuable collection of the United States, European governments, and leading entrepreneurs no longer know if they can trust the words of the director.
After reports that the US National Security Agency carried out espionage in Brazilian oil company and gained access to data provided by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, it achieved a general paranoia of state monitoring of new dimensions.
The last drop revealed that Angela Merkel's phone was possibly listened to for ten years.
If it can be the most powerful target in Europe, then it is certainly a potential target for the leading entrepreneurs.
Snowden reviewed intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by the EY Advisory Service, German companies are convinced that as regards industrial espionage and data theft, the US is now at the same high risk as China.
However, there is no evidence that the United States has transmitted the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies in the whole of the document revealed by Mr Snowden.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities, and have stated that it should try to limit its dependence on the USA:
The front entrepreneurs are about this skepticism.
From the German Parliament, the votes are calling for us to produce the German Google.
I can just close my eyes and open them again slowly...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they wouldn't have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is fed, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
The scope and technical complexity of the US spy agencies discovered by Snowden is shocking for some companies that have previously thought that China is the greatest threat of surveillance, though shocking.
There is a large turnaround in cloud computing technology, where European representatives have widely realized that data stored in the United States fall under dark jurisdiction and are therefore potentially offensive.
According to a survey carried out by the Trade Community Cloud security alliance about 10 percent of non-American members after the US program was discovered, the Data Drop Prism cancelled plans to use a cloud supplier based in the USA.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP's CEOs, says, "We have a new question for customers who haven't been here a year ago - where my data are stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German high officials argue that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew: strong states want to clear their most valuable secrets and these data must be protected at any price.
That economic espionage is not surprising.
It's always been done.
"It has been a key topic for many years and has not changed significantly during the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Director General of BASF Agrochemicals.
The Americans are carrying out espionage at the commercial and industrial level, just as we are carrying out espionage on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Entrepreneurships generally do not want to be covered by countermeasures that have made it impossible for attackers to benefit.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB drive or leaving unprotected notebook in the hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi Car Representation, says that it has been a practice for many years to collect before a mobile phone performance meeting so that it can not be used as a listening device.
The German office of BfV advises the leading workers to consider whether to use simple prepaid mobile phones abroad because of the risk that smart phones can be denied.
The prepaid mobile phones will then be released.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are the leading representatives of the global market in their specific areas.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorised access," BfV cautions in its report.
The United States warns its own companies against economic espionage from other countries.
According to Washington Post American National Intelligence Estimate, in February France, alongside Russia and Israel, in a second row of offenders involved in the hacker activity for economic reporting, and now behind China.
A member of the Council in a German risk-free society concluded that, as regards economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French Internal Reporting Agency DCRI, this month in one of the talks, said: "The services know very well that all countries, while working together in the fight against terrorism, are carrying out espionage at their alliances."
The parents of an unfavourable boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of an unfavourable boy from Georgia whose body was found inside the infamous competitive spirit in his high school believe that their son was murdered, the family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the city of Valdosta in Georgia, was found on January 11 in a well-balanced church behind the courts at the gym where he went.
The sheriff's investigators from Lowdes County have concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of a 17-year-old refuses to do so.
"They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, lawyer for FoxNews.com, representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said.
"They are convinced that it resists logic, physical laws and also healthy sense," Crump said.
They feel that it should cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for the death of their son.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he came back to them for dead," he said.
State representative Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting a regular investigation into Johnson's death, and noted that several key questions remained unresponsible.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
declared Moore at the press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll keep track of the fact that they're gonna tell me anywhere.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for normal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the original drink meant that Johnson died as a result of "suspension".
The second drink, however, according to Moore, introduced another cause of death.
"There are several questions to be answered or confirmed here," he said.
Moore added that if, in the case of Johnson's death, there is sufficient evidence for an order to investigate a criminal offence or violation of civil rights, the FBI and its implementation are requested.
The deputy sheriff's office from the county of Lowdes was not immediately available for a comment on Thursday.
A judge from South Georgia in the middle of the offices ordered that all videos from the surveillance cameras be made available to the investigators.
Parents of young people hope that the video recordings will contain a clue leading to the discovery of their son’s death.
CDC Centre issued guidelines on child allergy for schools
At the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), a package of guidelines has been issued to help in the case of children's allergies to food at school.
This is the first set of directives issued by the U.S. government because the number of children of school age who suffer from food allergies is rising.
One of the 20 children in the United States has an allergy to food.
The CDC Centre found that food allergy in children rose by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
For schools, the guidelines contain information on how the teacher’s congregation and staff should be aware of children’s allergies to food and how to react to allergic reactions if they occur.
It also recommends that schools have adrenaline – the most frequently used automatic injector of EpiPen – to be able to react to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State law authorities have recently updated the rules that enable schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that occur in conversations with children who have allergic reactions.
The child can say, "It's like someone's touching my tongue," "I feel like I'm having a hairy tongue" or "I know my tongue."
Parents of Intersexual Children Can Choose “Uncertain Sex”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise the third sex in children born with a non-uniform sexual arrangement.
Newborn children will no longer be appointed only to male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to introduce any sex for such children, and allows them to introduce sex as "unspecified" or "unspecified" on their family lists.
The aim of the law is to stop pressure on parents so that their child will be surprised to decide on an operation for the purpose of determining sex and to fight discrimination against those who are intersexual.
One intersexual person, according to the BBC, said after many years, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'll stay a slatanine-created doctor, frozen and dried.
It is estimated that every year since 2000, children are born one that is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, part of the group of about 60 realities that fall within the diagnosis of sexual development disorder, disrupting the term for those with atypical chromosomes, sexual glands (medicines or vertebrates) or unusually developed genitalia.
The intersexual could have been Wallis Simpson.
Gender identification is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that if sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information and to determine it instead of waiting and monitoring the psychological and physical development of the child until the surgery is carried out.
New York Psychiatr Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender issues, said that the new German law "seemed like a good thing".
Intersexual children represent ethical dilemmas.
"Some people are in a dangerous situation in life that requires surgery, but most children don't," he said.
Gender determination can be carried out without surgery and can then wait for the identity to develop.
Knowledge of how a child develops sexuality is not too accurate.
No one can answer the question why this is happening.
It's like a mystery, why some people are gay.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not linked to sex, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but is typically made up of both and cannot be clearly defined as one of them.
These drawings may appear in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, hair loss and personality, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and sexual devices, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination enjoyed by intersexual and transsexual people in the workplace, as well as the level of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't respond to any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to be identified in the official documents of the male, female or "third sex".
Norrie May-Welby, 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first-known "unfortunate" person in June when she won the court's appeal so that she could leave the status of "unfortunate" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, there will be German passports other than M (male) and F (female) and third label, X, for intersexual persons.
In neighbouring France, according to the report on France, 24 gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011 dozens of French legislators from this strongly Catholic country signed petitions for the removal of "the theory of sex" from school textbooks.
The American Catholic website online also came across the German law and wrote: “With the way the world is drawn to a new state, when sex is a question of choice, but sexual activity is not the same, we reverse the gaps of two other pillars of civilization.”
One mother of Maryland's newborns also said about the baby zone that she would rather see children having sex at birth.
"Family alone is stressful without any further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," said for the parental care website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female genders were called hermaphrodites, according to the prominent Greek who had two sexes.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that sex was something like a table that can be erased and crossed again.
But now many doubt the ethical basis of the operation that sexuality is a complex matter and doctors can sometimes decide wrong because they don't know how children will feel when they grow up in view of their sex.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.
Persistent theory of how to treat children with gender indistinguishable was presented by Dr. John Money at Johnse Hopkins University, who held the view that sex is a subject.
He created a new concept of "sexuality" and argued that social causes and the environment – as parents raised their child – affected the genes and hormones of children and created a child regardless of whether it was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as "John/John", his theory became controversial.
The parents of a boy whose penis had been damaged by a miscarriage, recommended that his child be left to be totally evicted, removed, and raised as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of change, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When he was 15 years old, he had to re-operate with the boy and marry his wife.
But in 38 years, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors "use this model" today.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these operations became "dissatisfaction with the result".
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes, but a non-uniform sexual device.
Doctors were not sure whether he had a big clitoris, or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he could never live a "satisfying life".
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed from the external organs and vertebrates and was raised as a girl.
He got female hormones in 12 years.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," said ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
In 18 he was sent to the morgue.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was scary.
After my birth, I was sterilized, and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender development disorder (DSD), which protected the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop its sexual organs.
After learning the truth, he turned to men, took the doses of testosterone, and let the prints be removed,
The surgery caused his infertility.
Today he represents others in the organisation called the Interface Project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the legal group Advocates for informed choice (responsibles of informed elections) is afraid that the German law "calls for cicadas and stigmats".
“Many activists fear that the German law will achieve that it will encourage parents to make rapid decisions and choose “uncertainty” for the child,” she said.
We're afraid it's going to trigger an intervention.
We think it's better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law ends up, so everything we can do is speculating.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supported the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be classified in the third sex".
"The adults should be able to make their own decision on the legal sex," she said.
The German law is about to allocate it at birth.
This is a battle that a little child should not have at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast nurse, who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a supportive group, said that the German law "gives authority" to both parents and children.
The daughter of Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called an insomnia syndrome for androgens.
Because her androgen receptors are contagious, they developed from Katie's female rice.
He's got a vagina, but he doesn't have a factory or an eggplant.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and working as an intern at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or replacement motherhood.
"The law gives parents some space so that they do not make their decision quickly," Baratz said.
Gives them time to carry out certain tests and think about it and give them time before they write "man" or "woman".
In this regard, everything is fine – you raise and love your child.
You have a wonderful child and you're happy about it.
You don't have to hurry with an operation that's irreversible.
"It gives the opportunity to involve both the child and the anxiety that parents are having because they are not sure that they are doing the right thing," she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex he identifies more with – and that is a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drinker ate the whole house with gasoline: he threatened to be burned even with his own family!
The tension increased, the fear was escalating.
The man started threatening to burn the whole house.
Instead, all available police guards in the area, as well as a unit of firemen from Mladé Boleslav and a unit of voluntary firefighters.
A police negotiator came to the scene, and a man tried to express his irrational behavior.
The man kept threatening to burn the house.
That's how she had to get into the house by an emergency unit that damaged and broke the man.
The attacker then ended his investigation at the juvenile hospital, where he was transferred to an anti-alcoholic arrest facility.
In the end, the Hassicians slept in a sorbent that they later cleaned up.
In addition, all pets were saved from the house.
He didn't put a man on the police negotiator, so he got a command.
Report: Obama's campaign considered changing Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisor, according to the New York Times, secretly considered replacing vice president Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton from 2012.
This revelation is the most important sensational book on the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemanna "Double down: Game Change 2012."
The Times magazine received a copy of the upcoming books and announced Thursday evening that the president of the summit collaborators held an intensive group meeting and research at the end of 2011 to assess whether Biden's rescue would help bring Obama's fainting hope of a re-election.
According to the national-political writer for the Times magazine, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of leading officials inside the campaign and in the White House, namely the former White House Chief, to measure the impact of the move on the election by the former ministry abroad on the post of Vice-President.
The potential change has been a highly sensitive secret within the Chicago infrastructure of the campaign and inside the Oval work.
Only a few of the next president's closest advisers – including Daley, former head of Obama's campaign Jim Messin and former chief advisors at the White House of David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that this change was being considered.
The book "Double down" claims that Daley was the representative of the attempt to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to do so, when data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would not significantly increase the chances of both.
In his interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering the replacement of Biden Clinton.
"I have studied a lot of things intensively, and this was one of them," Daley said for the letter.
You can't forget that the president had terrible views at the time, so we said, "Brother, what are we going to do?"
While Daley characterized the research as a "relevant care", Martin told Anderson Cooper from CNN that the campaign for re-election had made small investments to see if this would be paid out in elections.
"There is no such money for elections and qualitative research in the event of campaigns, if something really is not considered," Martin said to AC360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that Daley was wondering if his then boss knew about this potential card mixing.
While Daley said he didn't think that the president had any potential changes "was knowledge", the former head office admitted that it was "possible", that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double down" definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe reached Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought that Obama didn't know about the investigation concerning Biden's exclusion from the candidate.
"Perhaps," answered Martin.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British businessman produced the first ice cream that shines in the dark – for the use of medusa.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a brilliant palm tree.
He came up with the idea when he read an expert medusa deal, and convinced scientists in China to make chemical proteins that cause lightbulbing.
This freeze reacts with the language of consumption – increases pH in the protein and subsequently causes its radiation.
Chris says the ice shines when he reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and that's why the more you lie, the clearer the snow.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious" (oil me, taste great), says: "It's a wonderful substance, but when it comes to production, we're at the beginning, so you'll get about 2 g of this substance for GBP 200."
The protein we use in the freezer reacts with your language at neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms up, the pH increases and the ice level starts to shine.
We have tested it over the last few months and it seems to be a great idea for Halloween because it causes this fantastic glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever produced, because the lighting of the medusa is four times as expensive as gold.
And so every cup is worth about 140 GBP.
But it tastes great.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is known for its non-traditional taste of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
His next product is supposed to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I would really like to make an invisible ice cream."
It's basically impossible because of a piece of light caused by the ice crystal that freezes, but I'm counting on some way to do it, we'll find it.
Ice cream uses fluorescence properties of medusa, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By number
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
We could eat sweets with our sister, stay up for a long time and take the neighbors to the dressing room.
Today I feel like I've become a caretaker.
After two years there was no sugar in my apartment, and this year it probably won't be different.
But the statistics show that I'm, as far as Halloween is concerned, black sheep.
According to the U.S. Small Business Federation (NRF) this year, Halloween will celebrate the majority of Americans – in fact 158 million of them – and spends a total of $6.9 billion for candy, costumes and decorations.
But what I'm looking forward to every time Halloween is trendy.
According to the NRF, $ 6.9 billion of lost dollars is expected to go 1.2 billion on the costumes.
This year they're the last shot of fashion sexy non-living objects.
Sexy doesn't have to be just women anymore; sexy can be food like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As far as man is concerned, I expect us to see a lot of zombies due to the origin of the dead, and I bet that the spacemen of Daft Punk will pull into our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, they are the most sought after zombie costumes, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose it's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year, we dressed our dogs in costumes, and we weren't the only ones to my breath.
In fact, according to the NRF, the American spends $330 million this year on animal pet costumes.
So he'll see a lot of funny dogs.
As far as sweetness is concerned, we're not wasting our time.
According to Nielsen U.S.A., $1.9 billion is lost.
It's about 300 million kilograms of Hershey, lice, sweet milk duds and Twisslers, and Clark seal.
This is an amazing report for 41 million collaborators who, according to the U.S. Trade Ministry, are about to break down our neighborhood.
In fact, we're buying during Halloween, and you don't believe and consume 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn beans, and yet, according to the National Association of Sugars around Halloween, they sell almost 16,000 tons.
That's about 9 billion individual corn beans.
It's a secret I've never solved.
Nothing is more typical for Halloween than scary houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror beyond the walls", which is, by the way, a real prison, "Howl-O-Scream" (jekot, riv) and "The house of shock" (Dom Shock).
In fact, there are in the United States, officially dedicated 1200 scary homes that, according to the American scary houses, earn $500 million, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you're in fear and which give your friend on Facebook, and you can't remove them and the person you like, will look at the picture and write a comment like "You look beautiful".
And finally, there's a little bit about the dynamite.
When we were young, Charlie Brown introduced us a great day (Great Pumpkin) and cutting down the danish candle is something like making a Christmas tree – we're doing it from a little bit.
Luckily for us the trend "child in the day" began thanks to Pinterest's application only last year, so most of us grew up to cut the dick instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. People's Accounting Office, U.S.A. spends about $106 million.
The Daylight with a mythical flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245 thousand tons of daylight grew this year.
If you are looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathhisdonov from the city of Napa in California and try to cut their days weighing almost one tonne.
Noticed series of competitions Land Rover
The interior has race seats and six-storey safety belts as well as intercoms.
The selection includes improved brakes, service packs providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle coordination between individual races.
Drew Bowler, Technical Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The participants in the races that come to Bowler have changed."
Not all are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure, as well as an affordable route to world class races.
We are pleased that we can offer them this journey in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience various race disciplines in Britain and the sea, and that it will prepare competitions for the toughness and reality of Rally Raid races.
The development of the Defender Challenge vehicle we really enjoyed – it will be a really exciting competition.
Defender Challenge will also offer a school and testing day in February as well as an opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: Two years ago we have a preliminary election here
The president of TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects further early elections.
The week after the last conversation for Aktuálno.cz said that there is no other exit, and every government has made a vote last Friday and Saturday is impossible as a blind man.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, saying that the life span of the start-up election period is estimated to be two years.
With the objection that the voters will find it difficult to choose in a completely different way, they do not agree, "I think it will be a little more balanced decision."
At the same time, the president of TOP 09 does not accept that his party could still lose voters as of this year in other elections (approximately 300 thousand votes came against in 2010).
Schwarzenberg estimates that, if it is clear within two months that the early elections will take place, it will strengthen the movement of the ANO 2011 Andreje Babis.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babi will lose.
The turbulence situation in the ČSSD, where President Bohuslav Sobotka, after a hidden Dutch meeting of the party's leadership, declared that social democracy would remain either him or Michal Hasek, comments Schwarzenberg:
"The leading officials of the democratic party as small boys go to the head of the state to allow them to reverse the side."
"I thought Mr. Hasek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I haven't seen anything so rudely stupid in my life," said the president, TOP 09.
And towards President Zeman (who shot himself in the fight on the presidential function) he said, "The role of the state is clear: he wants to strengthen the party."
The first laws have already been tabled by TOP 09.
What was for you personally the biggest surprise of your election?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first draft laws in November, including the Far East Register of Treaties, which had been discussed by the November Committees before the elections, but with the early elections he fell under the table.
The president of TOP 09 in the conversation for Current.cz claims that such a speed is given by "these laws are needed".
At the same time, however, TOP 09 obviously wants to anticipate similar attempts on the other side.
For example, the ANO election leader Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election struggle of introducing the "fraud" program of the ANO contract register.
TOP 09 now used a jump - it just outlined a proposal that had already been made to the second recording reading.
The Hassic units came to rescue the lost dog, which hung 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous stone mine.
Ruby's chicken ran off after a little car accident.
Three days later she was imprisoned in a stone mill by a man who took the dog out.
The Hassites came down the rock wall to save the dog from a certain death.
The shield was released by fire units that came to release it after somehow stuck themselves on a dangerous site in the 15 - foot - above - ground stone.
Nine months later, Ruby ran away after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and he survived for three days on his own until he was released from the stone mine on Wednesday.
His owner Scott Alderson (25) and his friend Becky Hall (20) were at the flappit stone in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby again and thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he ran away when he got into a small accident, hot after his lost dog searched and placed challenges on social networks.
On Wednesday, at 2:15 p.m., a white dog caught Ruby on a cliff 15 meters above the ground.
Instead, he rushed a technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station and jumped down to free Ruby, using him to pick up the transport bag for the animals.
The technical rescue team chief Andy Clayton said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the bottom.
When he was saved, he did not move the door – he was totally frozen.
But he's fine now.
Then he got his t-shirts.
It was a very unusual ride.
The fact that the dog has been seen is incredible.
The expert leader of the technical rescue team Peter Lau said: "Ruby had great happiness during his escape."
There was a possibility that he would be very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet at the checkpoint, and besides the draining and dehydration, he was fine.
Ms. Hallová, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "In view of the rescue action, I was afraid."
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to keep him in his arms again.
The vet said that if he got too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
The Hasicians have done a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them, they were all just amazing.
Mr. Alderson from Keighley added, "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there."
The hats were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger claims that after 18 years, Katy Perry definitely didn't make it.
During an interview for the Australian radio show, this pop star said this week that for Jagger's song "Old habits die hard" from 2004 were accompanied by vocals.
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock vet and he went out after her.
And she said, “It was a long time ago, and now she is very kind to me.”
In a statement from Jagger's Thursday (70), the representative said that he categorically denied that he would ever make Katy Perry's proposals.
The representative said, "Maybe you're messing with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers (songwriters) who appeared this year on the Rolling Stones concert track.
Her new album "Prism" debuted this week in the first place.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe Gives Scotland a Choice
The next day, another scary story about independence.
This time, it appears a warning that the condition for membership of independent Scotland in the EU would be its accession to Schengen.
This led to stories of passport checks in Berwick and the rest of the way along Hadrian's Val.
The truth is that Strathclyde's newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but, as expected, this did not happen to headlines.
No one has also mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if they do.
Given that Scotland is not now in Schengen, a continuing supply of dissatisfaction would be a financial contribution to Brussels for anything they really want from Scotland.
So it's a pretty bad story.
And also so old that it became a excavation. I have heard from the press that "independence means passport checks", at least 40 years ago.
However, one interesting idea is hidden in this vousate story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why change the London hamlet for that Brussels man, especially now?
This is a real European story: a great war plan to unite Europe has finally collapsed.
The impact of the euro crisis is officially dead Europe's project.
On the other hand, Europe has the influence of the parties to the EU's dedicated resistance or the abolition of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Alternative for Germany – founded this year – came from nowhere and has already used nearly five million votes in the September federal elections, which from the Bundestag basically has been the free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats).
On the home floor, there was always a resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The resistance dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with a demonstration of commitment to the national economy through the single currency, has led many people to believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments having a high budget deficit – that was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is the euro system, which blocks its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of distorting domestic currency, southern Europe has an adverse effect on domestic production against Germany.
The only help is to cut revenue and public expenditure – which Germany is offering.
The current budgetary and monetary problems are a deeper cause of European under-performing performance.
As a result of the "green" energy policy supported by Brussels – a code for the support of French and German companies at consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for petrol than it does in the United States.
This is a paralysing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Not all the world's ice-cream payments would reverse the sinking of the European petrochemical industry with cheap breast oil from the United States.
As a result, there is a strong opposition, especially in France, once the EU's elected presidents are excited.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as an instrument that will keep Germany in place and enable Paris to build itself in the world at Washington level.
Berlin, however, no longer needs political legitimacy in Paris and has advanced its own economic policy in Europe and has left the French economy to its judgment.
Result: The correct wing of the Marine Le Pen, the anti-European National Front, has just won the main additional elections and removed the ruling socialists to third place.
The front is now 24% of the most popular party in France – a timely warning to British Labourers that they cannot judge that the right-wing is automatically smooth on the left.
How does Le Pen make up his newly acquired popularity among the white working class?
The European elections next year would like to use the European Parliament to create an anti-European bloc against the common currency.
If anti-European parties say good in these elections, which is likely, such a block can be dominated first in the history of the European Parliament.
I feel that, in due course, the anti-European feeling and attitude towards the common currency will be linked and the euro will be lost.
The EU does not disappear, but it is becoming more freer in the sense of "European (Sovereign) nations", General de Gaulle has already given priority.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may leave the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and join the United States.
However, Washington's increased interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the Atlantic cold.
Where's Scotland going?
We can choose to be a region (in principle) of little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – it is also possible to announce to Berlin and Brussels when we are to be left behind.
I assume that Scotland would be a good guide in the relaxed organisation of Europe, assuming it would preserve its own currency.
Cooperation with other similar thinking countries would be easier in the Non-Federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and leave our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – the most successful political move that does not require austerity in Europe, which was won by a large majority in 2011 due to the opposition to the plots planned (and implemented) by the Labour Office Alistair Darling and the following coalitions of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland had now chosen independence only to adopt austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Advanced
Research has shown that African Americans and Hispanics reach puberty before their white layers.
Physical changes don't mean they're getting close to puberty.
It is not shown that there are hormones or other chemicals behind it
Experts claim that an epidemic of obesity can be one of the triggers of a previous puberty.
The trend of the previous puberty is not so good for boys.
The former rapporteur, CNN Pat Etheridge, is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family problems.
Should a mother be afraid when her daughters begin to grow breast and swelling in shame in 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Child Doctors this week in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent a lot of time making sure my parents that it's usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," said Kaplowitz.
The visible signs of development, such as breast growth, swelling of shame and in the body and body smell, appear earlier in the girl.
In the last 40 years, however, there was only a small shift in age when the first menstrual period occurred.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years, compared with 12.75 years in 1970.
"When they begin to develop their breasts, they will last at least two to three years before the first menstrual period," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem"
The most reliable test of how puberty continues is time.
It is discussed about what triggers the actual onset of puberty, but if growth is accompanied by growth spores 8 years ago, the girl is considered to be "promising".
In most cases, the process is slowed down or stopped – which can be monitored carefully by children’s doctors.
The faster growth may be the reason for the endocrinologist to carry out tests to eliminate serious problems such as tumor or cyst.
There are medical procedures that await early menstrual periods and prohibit other consequences: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to growth and maturity stopping.
The recommendations regarding medicines and hormonal treatment depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
There are also important psychosociological aspects.
With regard to the use of drugs, Kaplowitz is careful, but recognizes that “repression of puberty can alleviate problems with the behavior of the girl and her feelings that differ from her peers”.
Understandably, there is another big problem: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstrual periods.
"They are worried that they can get pregnant, or how they can manage hygiene," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter began to have a period of ten years.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation together, it wasn't emotionally prepared.
She came from home school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is still no related file of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are guilty.
Boys – like girls – get to puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz promotes the assumption that the most serious reason is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study in girls from 6 to 9 years of age, which connects body fat to the time of puberty.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African Americans and Hispanics tend to reach puberty before their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global point of view, the patterns of early puberty appear to be affected by all possible economic conditions through climate to genes.
Another argument: While in low - age boys are exposed to face and shame, the trend towards the full bloom of early puberty is not as obvious as it is in girls.
Other doctors participating in the conference of the American Association of Child Doctors (AAP) added additional complexity to this topic.
The acne and swelling of the reproach is common even in the hips and batols.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the actual performance of puberty,” said Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist from the Goryebsk Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not weigh their child’s doctor’s instructions on how to talk to their child.
"It may mean the need to talk to the child before you assume," said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, your child will probably react well.
Girls who are developing before need to make sure that even if this happens early, this process is a normal part of life.
Hope of Konvalink in the role of the host.
Does he have a new job?
Herečka Nadja Konvalinková (62) appeared behind her in the role of housekeeping and she was very happy.
That the favorite Czech actress planned a change in the profession and went to business in the house?
Nadya Konvalink found herself in James Joyce Irish pub and poured a beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and it just went away.
The boss even offered me a job and I could live with beer.
But I refused, I'd rather stay at what I'm doing today, at acting," she said with Konvalinkov, who was a guest at the twentieth anniversary of the functioning of the Irish household.
"I like Irish beer, and I'm going to put Irish whiskey in there," she made up her taste of acting.
Nadi, a long - term friend and colleague of Paul Nový, also appeared at the event.
I'm after death, and in my new life, I can't cry.
I'm allowed one beer or one pancake a day, and I'm trying to keep it," the actor added.
Manufacturers of aircraft with a width of seats, in bets are big orders
Among the aircraft manufacturers, there was a heated dispute about the size of seats in the second class for long-distance flights, which this month resulted in a bitter exchange of views on the air show in Dubai.
The object of the dispute is the width of seats provided for long-term flights for the economic class — not exactly the ones that airlines would normally have preceded, but whose space allocated is key to the demand for efficiency of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industrial standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economic class, but the main American rival Boeing says they have to decide on this.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers competed in the sale of the largest version of their two-engine long-range aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the course of the 17th to 21st of November.
The way the last part of the aircraft is distributed – especially if it is set up by 9 or 10 seats – is the basis for the economic performance of the new mini-jumbo applications.
Boeing says that an improved "777X" model transports 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread out 10 each row.
Airbus says that the competitive version of its A350 model will transport 350 people in 46 cm of wide economic seats spread after 9.
Large aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through commercials in professional media.
Airbus now ahead of an air show in Dubai, where it is expected that 777X will gain advantage with more than 100 orders, calls directly to the public.
Recently, he showed what could be the beginning of a new advertising war when he showed the financiers a video showing three people stuck in the restaurant with the title "Would you like it?"
"Boeing promotes long flights in the seats of narrower than they are in regional turbotul aircraft," said Airbus John Leahy's sales manager.
As the digestive tract changes, people are bigger, but the seats in the planes have not changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air transport, according to the U.S. Ministry of Health data, the average U.S. weight of between 40 and 49 years has increased by 10 percent.
According to American health statistics, the average American has a 100 cm pass in the 21st century.
Airbus claims that his rival holds the concept of 50-year-old seats when the average width of the newly baptized aircraft seats was lower.
Airbus claims to have conducted a study indicating that the extension of the seat by 2.5 cm improves the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing’s dimensions of the seat of Airbus refuses and says it is not in the power of the aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more matters than on the width of the seat.
“It is really about providing airlines with flexibility and allowing them to carry out things that are convinced they must do to be successful,” said an expert on the Kent Craver cabin.
They don't want us to dictate to them what their profit is.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For the traveler, there is a more basic space for the arcs, but for the suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect the yields.
In this dispute, the competition in the order of aircraft with estimated trade in the coming decades amounts to at least 700 billion dollars at catalogue prices, enough to raise the tongue of your US and European exports.
As stated in July by the Reuters agency, the deployment of seats is exactly what triggers the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim that they reach 20 percent better performance than the leading market representative in this segment in their last two-engine remote aircraft proposals, the Boeing 777-300ER model with 365 seats.
The performance of Boeing depends in part on comparing the design of 777X with 10 seats in the row and the concept of 777 with 9 seats in the row.
The profit in unit costs is, in contrast, weakened by the 10-seat concept.
"The reason why Boeing is doing this is to speed up more seats and make its aircraft more competitive against our products," said Kevin Kenston, the guide for the comfort of passengers in Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in line for existing models 777 are in line with the fact that many passengers are for a thicker spread, which can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"Fourty-five centimeters wide seat would be great for passengers, but it is true that from the business point of view of Airbus, the proposal is justified by the threat of model 777," said an expert on the interior of Mary Kirby's cabin, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network portal.
Airbus and Boeing don't supply seats, but they offer the air carrier a catalogue of suppliers to choose from.
The air traffic controllers even carry a measuring belt with them to check the competition arrangements.
As long as it is comfortable, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense arrangement for low-cost companies and regional travellers.
Airbus offers model A350 with 10 seats in line, but says he hasn't sold it yet.
Airbus has today highlighted the need for greater cabin adjustment so that it offers larger seats in the streets in some of its planes.
Experts say that without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the challenge to new industrial standards will remain unheard, but can be removed from the range of sales of 777X.
The number of HIV infected has exceeded the thousand in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected increases annually.
For example, in 2002 tests confirmed infections in 50 people, five years later they were 121 and 180 in 2010.
Last year, 212 were infected and it was a record number.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year, I believe there is no doubt," said the expert on AIDS Miroslav Hlavatý, who for years led the Prague Light House for patients.
According to him, there were 165 HIV patients in the country last year from January to September, and there were 176 of them in the same period.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of this year, HIV has been confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected in Prague.
Their number in September reached 1005.
In the Middle East, there were 206 infected homes.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian region, 130 from Moravian-Sleezian or 116 from Ustek.
At least the infected came from Highland, there were 19.
A total of 88 percent of the patients were sexually infected.
In the past, fourteen people were infected with blood transfusions.
However, such a case did not appear in the Czech Republic since the beginning of the trial, which was more than a quarter of a century later.
Six children were born with HIV, transferred to them from their mother.
The nonsense in the film Gravity is, but it's looked beautiful, hard experts
A fantastic film from the universe of Gravity sold some time after the premiere in Czech cinema.
In October, he was seen by the Union film distributors of nearly 150 thousand spectators and made over 26 million crowns.
Most image rating reviews positive.
Others, however, find some inconsistencies in it.
The Lidovky.cz server asked experts from a number of astronomers and astrophysics about how they liked the film and whether they noticed some nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of the Star and Planetary Brno): I like science-fiction films that I consider to be modern, dream stories.
The film Gravitation doesn't stand out, even though it looks like a "physically real" performance.
No, but it doesn't mean he'd be bad.
I've enjoyed it a lot.
You can notice what Sandra Bullock's hair looks like, which somehow doesn't feel like it's all right.
Hubb's cosmic remote view and the International Space Station are moving along very different circular lines, so they cannot be seen in one shot.
Some film viewers calculate inconsistencies and even the whole behavior of fire in a state of no difficulty.
According to them, the scaffolds would also not endure such wounds.
The Herds in the film Gravitace often get into a collage with various objects and clothes without any major difficulties.
The criticism was not saved, nor was it a historical conflict.
So the extensive tragedy on the Earth's circular path is, according to some debaters, unrealistic.
She's also wondering why the doctor was sent to space to repair the technique.
People in the forums also argue about "unreal" conduct.
It acts like it's intended for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Star and Planetary of Prague): I have seen him so far only on a wide plate, but I can say clearly, I was fascinated.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, but science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost duty) not to hold to the reality accordingly.
"More than what you mentioned incompatibilities I was touched by the three times the space station with degrading level techniques (last Chinese) was shown."
"The Chinese will still look better by the end of the decade and it'll probably look better than it is in the movie."
Vladimir Karas (Director of the Astronomical Constitution of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, authors are very successful in trying not to break physical laws, and thus naturally oriented viewers appreciate that in various cosmic collisions and collisions, the moment of mobility is quite right, as expressed by the dictionary of physics, as well as the Earth's view of the universe is very realistic, including the thin columns of the atmosphere and polar beams in polar areas.
Incompatibilities will certainly be found in a more detailed examination.
For example, when reading comments, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various space debris on the circular track appears in some scenes to be reversed before it should actually be (from the west to the east).
Jiří Štěpán (an employee of the Astronomical Constitution of the Czech Academy of Sciences): Some things the creators have contributed to their needs, but no fundamental and in heaven I did not record a fault against logic or natural laws in the film, and compared to other films of similar intent, it is seen that the creators were concerned about the reliability of the events shown.
From moments that don't make sense, it's worth mentioning the fact that Hubbl's universe's remote view surrounds the orbit of the ISS.
As a result, there is a considerable difference in the speed of each other and the rescue operation could not actually be carried out as shown in the film.
Then, at the moment of the Kowalska (Cloney) and Stone's (Bulllock), I didn't notice that the whole ISS was rotating, so there is no clear source of force working on Kowalski, which forces both actors to be released at a time when they are no longer moving towards themselves.
A new nicotine vaccine may take pleasure in smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
The only dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse for life from nicotine dependence.
Before testing on people, it is necessary to carry out further tests that will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Well Cornell Medical School in New York says the first signs are good.
"We hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhaust all methods available on the market today, but have found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that all current approaches are overcome," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an harmless virus that has been formed to provide genetic information for the formation of anti-inflammatory antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the cells of the liver, which then begin to produce the gas flow of these antibodies.
The antibodies follow all the molecules of nicotine in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the chicken from getting nicotine bites.
In the test of the vaccine, added nicotine to the mouse, they continued in their normal activity.
But mice that were not vaccinated “relieved”, the researchers said, which is a sign that nicotine got into their brain.
Experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be given so often that sufficient antibody levels were maintained, so they proved to be expensive and non-practical.
The cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because they convert liver cells into factory for the production of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines for people would be completely safe, they could pass on to the children before they would have a taste of cigarettes to try, and that would predetermine the dependence on nicotine.
However, it would be much more likely to be used by smokers to stop it.
"They will know that once they start smoking again, because of the nicotinic vaccine, they will have no benefit, and this will help them get rid of this abuse," he said.
British scientists have said that the results were interesting, but they point out that further research is needed.
Tripody denies that Obeid would influence her.
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be examined by the State Committee for the Monitoring of Corruption.
The former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied that he would change the policy of coastal rental at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on the government controlled land.
The Independent Committee on Corruption (ICAC) extended its inquiry on Friday on whether Mr. Obeid was lobbying several state ministers to rent him on Circular Quay, where Obeids owned two restaurants and cafes, renewed without having to participate in the selection procedure after his funeral in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obei's hidden interests in these properties, on the basis of the evidence presented on Thursday by the former representative of Mr. Tripodi's head office, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pressed for public tenders.
The tenants opposed it and wanted longer contractual terms.
In 2009, rents for companies in Circular Quay, which brought Obeid's $2.5 million annually, were renewed without the need to participate in public competition.
Mr Tripodi, who served as port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a beneficiary of public competition.
He denied, however, that the changes were made to Mr. Obeid's request, which, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, was calling for a motion in the government's rental policy.
The review of the calls submitted in IAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obedem and Mr. Tripodim and Mr. Steve Dunn, the chief officer who came to the port resort after working under Mr. Obedem in the Fisheries Department.
"Was the purpose of the talks during these phone calls the development of commercial rental policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheely, Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but definitely not about this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obed.
Israeli military aircraft attacked a target in Syria, the responsible factor said
Israeli military aircraft raided the target on Thursday night at the Syrian port of Lázikija, confirmed the responsible administrative officer of Fox News.
This responsible actor did not specifically say what was the purpose, but said that he was at least one.
The Press Agency Associated Press indicates that the objective was the rockets of the Russian production SA-125.
At least twice a year ago, Israel launched an air raid on the supply of rockets in Syria.
A lot of things moved, and it's different.
Perhaps the commentary by Pečinka spoke in such a way that it was agreed that President Štech was insinuating the burden.
Heitman Chovanec was a suspect to me as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and is a symbol of the ČSSD issue still.
The other gentlemen led mainly their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is both practical and non-useable, Vice-President Zaoralek has been unable to talk on television as much as possible.
On this basis, I do not see a better option than to propose ČSSD to the Vice-President of the Senate of Gajdöšk, which alone would not have an initial handle and I think it would take the standard performance.
It's such a good solution that someone in charge will barely support him.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and to continue without breaking the party.
Alena Gajdöškova could without worry make up a minority government with only the blessing of the President Babi and without the people, but with the Human Health Minister Hovorka, who is actually a trusted social democrat.
This minimum government would have great stability because it would promulgate the right referendum law and thus commit itself to supporting the President of the Ocamura.
The President Babish would finally make progress, because he's smart and he'll see that it's not going without her.
People wouldn't bring trouble, because Hovorka is the wearer of the best they have, and they wouldn't be in the government otherwise.
The same applies to the UN, even here, would be a valuable minister, but if they reasonably do not want to join a risky government, but provide support, they will also do well.
Come on, let's give the only ones in Gajdöšk!
Foreign workers entitled to visa may undergo a "authority" test
As the government intends to expand police operations, it considers the "justice" test for foreign workers with visa clearance 457.
The test, if accepted, will be applied through the criteria to prevent the 457 programme from being used to fill unqualified jobs, or as the last return for family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion article was issued today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's rhetoric about foreign workers saying it could harm the Australian neighbours.
“The declaration of “citizens at the end of the front” and “work first for Australians” is a very unpleasant remnant since the links called for a protected labour market,” said the Australian-India Institute today.
Historically, it meant that the white working force should be protected – and I would not wonder if anyone in this region noticed the title of this historic artifact.
The discussion article outlines 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday at Sri Lance, where he was working with officials for feeding people, implemented five of the recommended changes and others remain to be considered.
Where the ‘authority’ criteria are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘the nomination is eligible for a situation where the candidate is in relation to or in relation to a personal relationship with the owner or relevant person of the sponsor undertaking’.
After past experience with companies that planned to sponsor a small number of employees but then employed hundreds of them, businesses may also be required to justify the number of holders of visa 457.
Among the 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka who was trying for asylum, he died suspected of a heart attack after arriving on the island of Christmas this week.
A man’s nine - year - old scared son traveled to Australia with him, and after his father’s death on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult brother who was also on board.
Australian authorities and men rushed to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2's work indicates that high-speed services for Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as the first phase is launched in 2026.
Baron Kramer said that the project "joins Britain together".
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he was "insulted" with the British government on this plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and West Midlands.
After the phase two will lead a line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government reassessed the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British government, which conducted interviews with the national transport office of Scotland, entrusted HS2 to discover further railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel time for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three and less hours.
Baronka Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that better connects Britain and its cities."
We gave SH2 green because the benefit that it brings is huge.
Without that, we face a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
However, it is also about connecting – the UK will be better connected thanks to HS2, 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
After the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support the Scottish membership of the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed track has the potential to bring enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds the economic weight to Scotland in the overall case of high-speed rail across Britain."
We are therefore excited to work with the British Government to explore the possibility of bringing the high-speed railway to Scotland and thus bringing all the benefits and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish government plans as it plans.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study with the British ministers during the next year and to the joint decision on further steps.
Together with Bart's arrest of the anti-corruption police inspection and analysis
Information about the arrest of Vita Barty began to spread on Thursday night when the message was delivered by the server First Amendment.cz.
The MF DNES has found that the case has taken care of the General Inspection of Security Councils (GIBS), whose people had to arrest Bart in the centre of Prague.
It was played in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
However, the inspection deals with cases where there are accused policemen, its powers apply to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the anti-corruption police officers is arrested - leading analysts and informatics Jan Petržílek.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
The spokesperson for the anti-corruption police, Jaroslav Ibeheh, refused to comment with the rumor that the media had to turn to GIBS in this matter.
Even her spokesman, Radka Sandor, did not want to say anything about the case, she referred to the City State Department in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of hidden realities," said the speaker's representative Štěpánka Zenklova.
Also from this inconvenient reaction, it can be ruled out that the event has taken place, but it is in the cover-up regime that allows the speaker to say anything specific.
In a similar situation, Bart's lawyer is Oldrich Chudoba.
The media said that Bart is representing "and in this matter", but since it is classified information, Bart's arrest cannot be confirmed or denied.
Some media first speculated that Bart's arrest could be related to some police president Petre Lessy.
This was done by Bart, together with former VV President Radke John, who was sitting in front of the Ministry of Interior.
The dispute, which led to a heated dispute between Fr. Petre's Extrem Untime and VV, had to even deal with the then President Václav Klaus.
I don't know where this relationship took on my person.
No one contacted me, I wasn't interrogated.
"I really don't know anything," said IDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lesy became the chief of police.
He was officially beaten by Radek John, the real boss of the party, but he was Bart at the time.
The boat was now running for the elections for the movement of Úsvit, the envoy's mandate escaped only closely - by 175 votes.
Tomio Okamura's leader said he doesn't even know what's going on.
"The Vít Barta was one of many candidates from many sides to our candidates and, as I said repeatedly before the elections, he was not even a member of the Uzvit direct democracy of Tommy Okamura," he distanced himself from Bart Okamura, who before the elections said that he had given Bart's space to run for Usvit, because he helped him solve the problem of the executors.
Vit Bart met with his former partner, VV Jaroslav Škárko, at the courthouse in 2012.
The rules on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Travellers of Australian airlines will still have to shut down their tablets and smart phones during the launch and landing even without regard to changes in the USA in order to mitigate the regulations on these devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given the US company space to change its procedures, so passengers will be able to read electronic books on their devices, watch videos or play games during critical phases of the flight if the devices remain in "aircraft" mode.
Travelers can already do this during the major part of the flight, but many people are concerned that they cannot have access to their electronic books during the start-up and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a great deal of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but they have indicated that they do not have a plan to change their procedures in the short term.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that this notification had been investigated, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of the flight are still in force in Australia.
‘CASA currently does not have any specific provisions governing the use of electronic devices in the aircraft,’ he said.
This question is covered by rules which require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained throughout the period and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, who had already talked to CASA about extending her board entertainment wi-fi system, was subject to a change, but announced that the regulatory authority’s decision was subject to a change.
"We would welcome if the CASA authority had carried out an analysis of the authorisation to use electronic devices, because we really think that it would have improved the experience of customers now that we have (a wireless deck) entertainment," the speaker said.
The company of Qantas announced that it would continue to comply with the current rules.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this in a hurry," he said.
FAA requirements apply to US airlines.
But we are constantly interested in the development in the regulatory area that can be useful to our passengers, and we are sure to study carefully the decisions of the FAA and the reasons behind it.
In the case of U.S. air carriers, the impact of regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their airport park.
Operators will have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference of mobile phones, as well as review manuals, training materials, manual baggage programmes and information for passengers.
“As long as the airline confirms its fleet tolerance, it may allow the passenger to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readings and smart phones at any altitude of the sea,” the FAA said.
In rare cases, the crew shall command the passenger to turn off during the installation.
The group also recommended that the heavier equipment be safely stored under the seat or in the spare space above the head during take-off and take-off.
The growing middle class enjoys the flora of Singapore
Janani Amirthlinga's gold bracelet, ring and earrings is stopped in the Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore so that she can pay her daughter for school.
“We just bought a house with our husband, and I put all my money on it,” says Mrs. Amirthlinga.
Although every month as an administrator gets $2400 (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, family monthly income is insufficient, says.
In fact, the demand from areas in Southeast Asia, where household debt is increasing, is that ValueMax, where a woman carries out her transaction, has become a third-story stock exchange in Singapore this week.
The suspension of spices is not only a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs Amirthlinga – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
The Singapore authorities usually apply an annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent rate offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, founders have the advantage that they do not require a person's verification (payment history) or a receipt document, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
And that's why how families feel the pressure of rising living costs and rising household and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to capital.
After five years of strong growth from the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by the released monetary policy in advanced economies, families with low and medium-income households are turning to employers to deal with the worsening financial situation.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's quoted increased use of credit in households primarily because of increasing rents as a risk factor for the credibility of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in Asia.
Malaysia is at the front of a record plate with a rate of 80 per cent of GDP, which is the increase of 60 per cent in 2008.
Economics were also alarmed by high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week only came from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed continued poor exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
“It is essential that with rising costs, people will try to supplement their income from medium to low [acceptance scales] anywhere,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist in the Malaysian CIMB bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have contributed to the fact that people are captivating their personal property and taking advantage of the opportunity to change for the cash of their family jewelry.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 city capitals are made of gold.
People say the gold price looks good, we'll stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month.
The largest operator stopped in Thailand, EasyMoney, recorded up to 20 per cent increase in the number of customers using its warehouses in recent months.
Growth in the construction sector is so large that ValueMax, the operator of branches in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also beyond Asia, says Executive Director ValueMax Yes Lee Chingová.
The company will finance it by using 60 per cent of the 66 million SGD received this week at the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discontinuity believers have been criticised for high interest rates, Mrs. Yeah says that the institution offers not only lower rates than other believers, but it also does not directly raise debt.
"The customers stop objects that they already own, and the financing of personal property does not raise the debt of the household," he says.
In the company, the foundation of the property is increasingly accepted as a means of ensuring short-term, secure financing.
In addition, there are not just people in the financial press.
The rich people from Singapore also use the ValueMax side when they stop golden flags or Rolex watches, and they can reach up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are of every possible proportion.
“They are rich individuals who need short-term loans for their brave trades or investments, or small businesses who need help with solving their cash flows,” says Mrs. Yeahová.
Sometimes they just need money as fast as they can.
Saving package worth $325 million for Tasmanian health care
The Federal Government insists that a $325 million savings package for cosmetics in Tasmania should contain tough conditions that will ensure that the government does not waste funding.
The Federal Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Union is "a rapid measure" to reverse the crisis caused by the ageing population of the island, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Financing for four years has been decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilk.
"The government has come with an emergency rescue package, which we believe will solve the specific problems it faces," Mrs Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for surgery at the patient's request.
Further 2,600 operations including orthopaedic operations and operations of the gray shield will help to remove debt.
Money is also available to free clinics in Hobart and Lanceston, better post-operative care, training of health professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments are responding to the ideas that leading clinical doctors have told me that they will best help the Tasmanian health system," said Mrs. Plibersek.
The Ministry stressed that the Government of Tasmania must require a strict reporting and record-keeping regime.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive the Australian bond money and inform each month of where additional funds have been made available.
A tripartite committee will be set up to ensure that the State provides services as effectively as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million will not go to anything unless the real reform is followed with a view to establishing a more sustainable basis for the Tasmanian public health system.
However, he commended the government for its response to his request for accelerated assistance, which he first brought in in the discussion with the Government's president in early May.
"I believe that the federal relief package can free public health from critical state," said Wilkie.
According to the Government, these additional procedures chosen will significantly reverse the recent shortcomings.
The spokesperson for the federal opposition in the area of health Peter Dutton believes that today's declaration is only "aggravating".
"The reason I'm here is that the Labour Government has removed $430 million from our health system," said ABC TV.
You can't have a government that takes almost half a billion dollars, and the Australian bond that spends $300 million, and pretends it's a good news.
Mr Dutton called on Mrs Plibersek to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be issued for higher red tape.
Guillaume Niceux adapted Denise Diderota's novel, which brings exceptional film production and time creation, but is also more boring than it should be.
They take place in the 1960s in France, and they tell a cloudy story about Suzanne, a young nobleman who is sent to a convent by his family.
When she wakes up, she enjoys extremely cruel treatment from a criminally repudiated mother, who for one becomes an object of sexual passion.
The film will never fall into the laziness or laziness, and that's his problem.
The sacred root of this story leads to the fact that even the spectators will experience a torment similar to that of a belted shirt.
Skiers want to take care of families with children
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production resources, the supervisory authority says
Syria destroyed the basic equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with toxic gas, the Committee for Global Monitoring of Chemical Weapons said Thursday, while severe conflicts broke out in the north of the country, not far from one of the places where toxic substances are stored, according to the assumptions.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war almost three years ago.
The notification of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before 1 November,
the time limit set by this organisation, based in The Hague, to destroy or disable the operation of all equipment for the manufacture of chemical weapons and machinery for mixing chemicals for the purpose of the production of toxic gas and the filling of ammunition.
The completion of this initial phase of destruction in principle is a significant milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy by mid-2014 all the chemical weapons of Damascus.
The destruction of equipment means Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, the lady must begin the destruction of existing weapons and resources.
This country is expected to have about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including hyperthyroidism and nerve gas.
The announcement came at a time when the battles in Sapphira, which experts speak of as the factory’s headquarters for the manufacture of chemical weapons and storage facilities, was launched on Thursday, by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, based in Britain.
A group of activists who monitored the total number of victims through the network of activists in Syria announced on Thursday that 120 296 people died.
There should be 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 members of the armed forces of Bashar Asada, 18 678 military commanders and 187 armed men from Lebanon's Hizballah are to go.
There are also 2,202 government survivors and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations organization estimated that 100,000 people died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
The Asad units fought in Safira against the rebels, many of whom are associated with Al-Qaeda for weeks.
The observable on Thursday stated that the losses were on both sides, but had no specific numbers.
The fights posed a threat faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who are on their mission, when they have to set up a chemical arsenal in the middle of the ongoing civil war in Syria.
A statement from the OPCW Office, which is closely cooperating with the United Nations, said that its team is now “satisfying that it verified – and monitored – the destruction of Syrian declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling”.
He added that "no further control activities are currently planned".
Earlier this week, inspectors said they finished the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 seats declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said that because of my fear of security, they weren't able to visit two places.
On Thursday, the OPCW authority stated that those two seats were ‘refused and ... the items of the chemical weapons programme which it contained were moved to two other declared positions that were checked’, according to Syria.
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira facility was one of those places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has approved a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I swear by the courage and bravery you showed in fulfilling this most demanding mission that this organisation had ever had," said the director of the observers Ahmet Uzumc in his comment issued by the OPCW.
Now, in their third year, they stand against themselves in civil war, especially the Sunni Muslim rebels and Asad, with their security forces, which are full of the Alaiwit sect, against Shiite Islam.
With regard to further development, the Chief Observer Ramí Abdul Rahman said on Wednesday there was a strong explosion inside the Syrian coastal province of Lázikija.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the judgment brought against the founder of the bombing in Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the bombing in Bali in 2002 responded in a strong way to the judgment of the last of the founders who were put before justice and said that Umar Patek should be corrected.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years running as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for setting up an explosive device used in the bombing.
He could be released on parole in 15 years.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty in several other charges related to terrorism, including a series of bombings against churches in Indonesia on the night of the year 2000.
The complaint called for life, although it could take a man named "Demolition man" (bour) to receive a death penalty due to his reputation as an expert in the production of explosives.
This decision restored the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother of Perth, who lost her 39 - year - old twins Jane and Jenny almost ten years ago in a devastating attack by Patek and other founders.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek should be sentenced to death.
I really think he should go in the footsteps of the others.
For the AAP agency, Mrs Corteen said: "It should be set up in front of the repair shop."
Every day, I have to live with the fact that I don't see other grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was compared to the country when on 12 October 2002 a strong charge was fired shortly after the 23rd hour, located outside the parked supplier.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy bar, where in just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide killer fired a bag full of explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, three times the doctors “dead”.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should face the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jama Islami, responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlase and Imama Samudru – who were corrected four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one.
Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive, it's just not.
Get 20 years for killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others, it's not that much.
Patek stood before the court as the last of the assassins in Bali.
The arrest was avoided for nearly ten years, but finally in January 2011 it occurred in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where in just four months later US forces killed former leader Al-Qaeda Usámu bin Ládina.
During the trial, an FBI agent in his testimony declared that reports from the intelligence services revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Ládine in an effort to re-establish the connection between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't give up voluntarily," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he has not felt sorry for how much grief he has caused to others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and which will include a ceremony in Bali and Australia.
"This year we will see a lot of tears," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against the verdict.
FAA: Passengers in air transport can now use technology supplies in aircraft (but cannot call from their mobile phones)
Passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic devices “from door to door” – apart from calling from their mobile phones – to read, play, watch movies and listen to music based on the expected new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Thursday.
But passengers don't expect changes to happen immediately.
As soon as the change is introduced, according to individual airlines, the manager of the FAA Michael Huerta said at the press conference.
Air carriers will have to provide the FAA administration with the number of aircraft that comply with the new rules and that they have updated the training manuals for the crew and the installation directives in order to comply with the new rules.
FAA has indicated that some airlines have already received plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aeroplanes.
Between the companies that have already passed the plans, Delta and JetBlue are.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we can improve the expanded use of electronic devices very quickly," the FAA stated in its statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smart phones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They cannot be activated until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain does not permit.
Passengers are expected to shut down their devices again when the plane falls to stop, and they will not stop until the aircraft is on the ground.
According to the new rules, air carriers whose aeroplanes are properly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, take-off and take-off, the FAA has introduced.
Most of the new transport aircraft and other aircraft, which have been modified to allow passengers to use Wifi at higher sea level, are expected to meet this criterion.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
"As soon as new rules are introduced safely – and we will work closely with transport companies – it will be a success," Glading said in his statement.
It is already a matter of being honest that we look like "watchers."
However, surfing on the Internet, sending e-mails and texting or downloading data will still be banned below 3 kilometres of sea level, the agency said.
The passenger will be informed that his smart phones, tablets and other devices will be switched to flight mode.
So there are still no words with friends, online game of type Scrabble, which actor Alec Baldwin played on his smart phone in 2011, when he was, as well known, expelled from the American Airlines aircraft, because he refused to turn off his equipment when the plane was parked at the gate.
And harder devices like notebooks will still have to be stored because of the fear that they might hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Phone calls will still be banned on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones do not determine FAA, but the US Federal Telecommunications Committee.
FAA may suspend the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month Mark Rosenker of the State Committee on Transport Safety, a National Safety Expert on Transport at CBS News, said that mobile phones are still at risk.
"Mobile phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially create a break with navigational devices, but from FCC data we also know that they can cause a break in air transmission towers," Rosenker said.
The Advisory Committee established by the FAA to investigate this problem proposed last month that the government should allow wider use of electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has been developed on the FAA to mitigate restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, claim that there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult because the use of such devices is everywhere.
Some studies suggest that when a third of passengers forget to turn off or ignore their devices.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to the disruption of navigation and communication equipment when passengers started carrying FM radio, the technical exploitation of the time.
New airlines are much more devoted to electrical systems than aircraft of previous generations, but are also designed and approved by the FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
Air carriers have already offered the passenger use of Wi-Fi at travel altitudes over the sea for several years.
Plans adjusted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to distortion.
A large majority of airlines should be adapted under the new rules for greater use of electronic devices, said Huertová.
Current electronic devices generally predict much less intensive radio transmission than they did in previous generations.
For example, e-readers only issue minimum broadcasts when turning the page.
But sending is stronger when devices download or send data.
Among those who press for restrictions to use these devices as passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011 the representatives of this company loaded the aircraft with their electronic readings Kindle and carried out the pilot flight, but no problem arose.
The members of the FAO Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities present any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Air Operators said that it is convinced that the disposal of these devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee have declared that there are only alarming reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause a disruption of air systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA pilots be allowed to direct passengers to turn off equipment during flight according to low visibility devices.
The Group of the Travel Industry welcomed these changes and it is based on a reasonable procedure for the travelling public, which is using technology to a large extent.
"We are pleased that the FAA has acknowledged that the pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with security," said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was transported from the garden area in the North Sea and released back to nature
The bird was transported on the coast after being found exhausted on the oil surface in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One baptism was carried by a helicopter last month to Aberdeen after being treated by the Scottish company SPCA in the rescue centre until he was cured.
Colin Seddon's operating center said: "This baptism was likely to migrate from northern Europe when it was caught by a strong wind over the North Sea."
According to all, he was given the power and found the shelter on the oil floor.
Mr. Seddon added: "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted for help."
At the time he was baptized, he was in good condition and health.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign (British Trade) was launched in April with the commitment to link businesses and define what changes in the EU relationship they want to see as British entrepreneurs and companies creating jobs.
To this end, we have launched the largest and most complex research in which we have asked British entrepreneurs about Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov questioned 1,000 leading companies representing British companies of the most diverse sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the research will be for many surprises.
We have found that the dreary majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states are stagnant.
They want to see how the government is taking priority over new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, before they step into the long and demanding process of reforming the secret European institutions.
When we asked their views on specific policy areas – from monopolistic regulations to production laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
It was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and the entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulations are now outweighing the benefits of being part of the European trade area – the agreement has even expressed 40% of the large companies, which is traditionally the most pro-European companies.
Finally, our research of leading companies revealed the most obvious knowledge, although the clear majority wants Britain to seek to change the Treaty and the relationship with the EU that should be based on trade, not politics.
It follows from the finding that companies of different sizes and main business groups are pushing the business sector towards a "significant change", which will shift the impact back to Britain.
There is much to be said – the achievement of the amendment of the Treaty and the better agreement for Britain can mean a profit of up to 16 % when voting in the EU referendum.
The President of the Government should not weigh: this survey shows that British trade supports its plan to renew British membership conditions in the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this innovation to mean a significant shift from the current export of force back to Britain.
A better agreement for Britain is possible and given the way in which the euro area is being spent on the road to a narrow economic and fiscal union, even more necessary.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, and as the results of our research show, this means a renewed focus on trade and fundamental change in Brussels's regulatory approach.
John Kerry admitted: The spying went too far!
The United States sent "too far", according to the AFP's chief American diplomat John Kerry during a video conference between Washington and London.
However, according to the Minister, the collection of information served to deter terrorist attacks.
According to the AFP, "The first recognition from Washington" was in the middle of a strong debate on the two coasts of the Atlantic on the scandalous discovery of a mass monitoring of data by the US National Security Agency (NSA), whose goal was also to become American allies.
"In some cases, I admit, just as the President (Barack Obama) did, some of these actions have gone too far and we make sure that this will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the conversation, however, he defended current practices.
It considers that the collection of information is necessary for the fight against terrorism and the prevention of the assassinations, such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States, the assassinations in Madrid in March 2004 or in London in July 2005.
"We prevented the aircraft from falling, the buildings exploded, and people were killed, because we were able to be briefed on the accounts," Kerry stressed.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases went disproportionately far".
The affair around American research, which allegedly followed hundreds of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were also tracking the mobile phone of the German office of Angely Merkel.
European leaders have not been shielding themselves and some of them have called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would command or significantly restrict monitoring.
Alexei Miller from Gazprom says the pipes in Bulgaria start a new gas era
The launch of the South Stream pipeline building in Bulgaria means the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, said Gazprom Director.
"Today we witness the border: the construction of the Bulgarian gas pipeline South Stream, the largest and most important project in Europe," said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "always" removed.
As soon as the whole project starts its operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will get gas from the South Stream gas pipeline at a cheap price.
Gazprom says the building has to start in other countries in the direction of the end of this year.
The gas pipeline is designed for the annual capacity of 2.2 billion rounds of ground gas.
Hezballah sent thousands of warriors to Syria.
They're waiting for a decisive battle.
The Lebanese movement of Hizballáh settled 15,000 of its warriors north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle on the mountainous region of Kalamún.
According to the ongoing Israeli reports, in the middle of two hits in western Syria, he destroyed the rockets intended for Hezballah.
This Lebanese Sheikh organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the Syrian army.
Its programme is also a fight against Israel, which is not involved in the Syrian conflict, but clearly said that preventing the movement of weapons to the hands of Hisballah to Lebanon.
Reports of the Israeli Middle East raids on weapons stockpiles in western Syria are only being clarified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but it was confirmed by American sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean have hit the Syrian missile base Snúbar Jabla south of Latakija.
The Al-Arab reporting station claims that there were two funds infested in which missiles were prepared for transport to Lebanon.
According to her sources, Russian production rockets were SA-8.
Israel refused to comment, but military analyst Ron ben Jišaj said that Syria is constantly trying to supply Hizballah with rockets and Syrian aviation teaches members of the armed section of Hizballah to deal with rockets.
SA-8 is an obsolete rocket that has an 80-year-old Syrian army.
They're placed on a mobile conveyor.
Although relatively primitive, with mobility and small dimensions it is easy to hide them.
They're equipped with a radar, but after the fire, the gun will turn off, so it's hard to focus on.
Latakia lies in western Syria, in the area inhabited by the ruling alavitas.
It is a well - guarded area, and Hizballáh has been involved in battles in western Syria in the past.
He claims to help protect the Syrian Shiite community, to which the Fascists belong.
Now it is estimated that 15,000 of his warriors are ready to help get the army back to Kalamun.
Together with Hizballáh, he also forces his troops into the Syrian army.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third largest city in the country of Homs.
The battle is to be held by the source of al-Arabi for a recent attack by the Syrian Shiite Brigade Abu Fadla Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hizballah helped the Syrian army fight back at the Lebanese border this year.
Many of the rebels from Kusajra just went to Kalamun.
Recently it seemed that most of the citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
As a reason, corruption, the disbursement of money for pre-purchased purchases and state orders, the increase of taxes and in the last series of government scandals were mentioned.
According to the results of the elections, most citizens have achieved this status.
The fact that they did not really care about it and the state that was here (the theft and debt of this state) were actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I would not explain that 3 413 497 voters did not make the election, 596 357 voters elected TOP 09 384 174 voters elected ODS in general, thus 4 394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all legitimate voters.
Which is the upper half.
When 1 016 829 ČSSD votes are added to the above-mentioned parties, then the old order (because all of those parties were involved in the "stealing" and the debt of this state), then 64.23% of the eligible votes were agreed with this regime.
In fact, the majority of the voters have indicated that they are not for the punishment of the perpetrators of the theft and surrender of this state.
Or do you think that the members of the ČSSD who have participated in the rules on the relevant laws are involved?
Is there any help?

The Royal Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Youth Association (YMCA) had been accused of charges against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children learned that, prior to charges against the child educator Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Youth Association (YMCA) in New South Wales complained about the sexual abuse of children.
But before the Commission, it was announced that in its initial statement to the Commission, this association stated that the case of sexual abuse of the child had never been resolved in its organisation.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked where one of the employees of the YMCA Association was accused of child pornography offences, and the other when a gymnast in Caringbah from the YMCA Association was convicted of sexual harassment of children in 1991.
Mr. Hare said to Gail Furness, the board's advisor, that he knew about the first case, but not about the second.
He assumed that the YMCA association’s initial declaration was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits had been carried out in the YMCA organisation, which were assessed by that organisation as a front-end of the rights of children.
The evidence submitted by the Commission is that the YMCA organisation was informed that it received the second lowest of four possible assessments in the audit of the Ministry of Education and Society from August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA Association when he was 21, admitted that the leadership from him himself had failed when Mr. Lord took it, without ensuring that the staff were aware of the obligation to report violations of the rules on child safety.
Earlier this year, Lord was sentenced to 12 boys who were allowed to work in the YMCA Association for two years.
He was arrested for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, refused to claim that the YMCA association had a cultural problem that protected staff from reporting child safety violations by Mr. Lord.
The staff gave evidence that they were witnesses of such violations, including that Lord was with the children on his own, in particular watching them, letting them sit on his lap, telling them that he liked them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for children's safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the head of the YMCA Children's Association in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was “very scary and often difficult to talk to him about”.
The Director-General said he did not accept evidence from staff that they felt unknown if they were to contact their superiors and report the facts.
Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord had darkened their judgment, and that is why they did not find a problem.
Mr. Hare said that the Council of the YMCA Association in New South Wales had informed his opinion that training from the "Jonathan Lord's case" for the organization consisted of staff having "no message", and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to allow staff to sign agreements on the maintenance of the silence shortly after the indictment was discovered made by the General Manager for Child Services in YMCA Liam Whitley.
He said the aim was to avoid the violation of evidence, but it was "exceedingly hot" and misconception.
Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University said that YMCA in New South Wales was not an organization in 2009 until 2011 that would be safe for children.
He said there were serious problems in recruitment, verification, employment, training and staff management.
The hearing was postponed on 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of Prime Minister, but admitted that the return is unlikely.
During the night discussion on the occasion of the fifth year of his departure from the Office, 59-year-old policy expressed its views on the various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, after ten years in the lead position, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussions on British politics and limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role in sending out the Biscay Pacific Quartet.
When asked whether he would return to the post of the Prime Minister, his answer to the London Evening Standard was as follows: “Yes, of course, but it is probably hard to do so, so...”
While in Cardiff, representatives of the experts gathered to perform horses to fight for the horse price of the year, it was clear that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although not yet attending school and only a few months ago did he make the first legs, this boy and his pet pet, Shetland ponie Toffee, the smoother three rounds to finally win the main prize and leave behind 30 adult rivals.
This unsolved two – with the same height – was approved by the Sunnybank riding centre in Rudry village near Cardiff for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition.
He stood up against the gentlemen and I gave him in elegant hats, he put his bar in a happy corner and let his two-year-old Toffee walk around the circle.
Fenton was praised by the jury for its natural ability to control horses that far exceed his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee got to his third birthday in March, and since then he's been practicing with this Shetland pony every day.
His mother Donna (30) said, "Fenton and Toffee work together perfectly."
They didn't make great hopes, but they finally left with a golden cup and a flower.
It was just the second time he competed with Toffe, and when he won, we were excited.
Everyone considered him a phenomenal and totally foreign people wanted to take pictures of him.
A boy from Nantyglo village near Ebbw Vale in South Wales is walking in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who plays horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says: "There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone was excited and excited."
He ran through the sand all along the arena and even though he acted so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is a stocked animal – he loves horses, tractors and a farm and gets two chickens in charge.
In view of how he started, he'll be back soon for the horse of the year and I'm sure he'll do well.
The speaker's annual horse performance competition said: "Fentons are only three, but already knows how to control the pony."
It's a great team together.
The jury raised Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and for the way they were held in the competition district.
They always watch how good team work is between the pony and the leader – and Fenton and Toffe were on the best ovaries.
I'm sure Fenton also helped with the lovely clothes, he really fell in there with him.
Too many curious newspapers are to be examined
The Chinese newspaper, which on the title page requested the release of the defendant from the contract, will be thoroughly investigated, the press administrator said.
News New Express, based in Guangzhou, made a rare public request to release journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr Chen later admitted on television that he was paying to invent stories about the company partly owned by the state.
The manager said that the New Express newspaper will now perform a "full repair".
The order for “preparation” came from the State Administration for Printing and Publications, Advertising, Film and Television in Kuang-tung Province.
The preliminary investigation showed that during the period from September 2012 to August 2013, New Express from the Chachengian Evening News group issued a number of false reports about that company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express was unorganized," the manager said in his statement.
He said he had to decide "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of a cancellation of the press license".
Furthermore, “he ordered the Yakcheng group Evening News to complete the overall reform of the New Express and recommended that the responsible persons be examined in New Express and immediately changed the management of the New Express”.
Mr. Chen wrote for New Express several articles dealing with financial imbalances in the company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his papers were issued on the title page of two requests for his release and claimed to be worth his journalistic work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted that he had issued false stories for payment.
"In this case, I have caused the damage of Zoomlion and also to the entire media sector and its ability to gain public confidence," the CCTV State Reporting Station said.
I did it mainly because I was looking for money and fame.
I realize I did wrong.
After Mr. Chen's apology, he published a New Express on the cover page of the apology, stating that he failed when he did not carry out sufficient control of his messages.
In recent times, several sharply monitored suspects have been admitted on television.
Experts say that confessions are still regularly enforced, regardless of the amendment of this year's law, which prohibits the authorities from forcing anyone to blame himself.
A tunnel was found for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most creative tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico has succeeded, complemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric railway.
The U.S. authorities described the tunnel of dimensions about one time a meter as one of the most intelligent secrets they've ever discovered.
The tunnel, which clicks to the length of nearly six football matches, connects the warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the United States.
This area is full of undecided warehouses, where you can easily hide cargo cars before they are loaded with drugs.
The authorities indicated that the tunnel was closed before the drug could be transported undetected.
Along with the discovery of a tunnel, the authorities also held eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men, according to the authorities, who worked as a driver, were complained of holding marijuana and cocaine to distribute them.
In the case of a judgment, he shall face sentences of deprivation of liberty from 10 years to after the time of his life.
In the city of Nogales in Arizona, the passengers penetrate vast drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which in front of drug cartels poses a problem as quickly as possible to get your product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a walk of about 650 meters long equipped with colleges, which led from one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economics and the Centre propose management.
For example, the offer of a joint advertisement
A new, integrated new-room of Economy in Prague.
Economics has taken another step to transform the holding of the Centre into its media home.
Since Friday, Economy and the Centre have shared top management.
"The unity of the organisational structure and the personal union are essential for the integration of both publishers into the common media house," comments Vice-President of the Economy and Director-General Kamil Kermák.
The Kermak, who will be in front of a single management, will be complemented by the Executive Director of the Centre Holdings Andreas Demoth.
The new joint sales manager was named Pavel Voparíl, which is also subordinated to Zuzana Tilčer.
The new chief of information technology became Štěpán Burda.
The joint editor is Vladimir Piskáček, whose team is also the director for the transformation of Jakub Unger.
The newly established position of marketing director was entrusted to Adela Pitts.
The independent service of corporate communication is new to Věra Lhotská.
The Joint Financial Director is Karel Žalud, managing human resources for both publishers led by Peter Slabá.
"The new organisational structure will, among other things, allow us to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, better link the content of all the titles issued and, last but not least, further significantly improve the business management of the company," Kermák added.
The company, which was owned by Zdeněk Bacala, concluded a contract for the purchase of the Centre Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings creates servers Aktuálně.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Nastisto or portfolio of other wireless two dozen smaller websites.
The company is the publisher of the Economic News, the IHNED.cz news server, the Weeks of Respect and Economics and the quantity of printed and Internet B2B titles.
The Czech publishers have the longest success in selling digital versions of their main titles.
This year, in June, publishing moved to newly built modern spaces in Prague.
CME's on TV business.
It'll release almost a quarter of the people.
The media group CME will be released.
By the end of the year, he's trying to save thousands of people.
He's planning all the side-by-side activities and wants to focus only on his main business, television broadcast.
A group that owns Nova TV in Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia employs a total of about 4,500 people.
That's how nearly a quarter of the people come to work.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is part of CET 21, which holds licenses for broadcasting television stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and Czech version of MTV.
How much savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the German television unit TV Nova, it is not clear yet.
"This is premature and we can't really comment," said the communication director New Josef Koukolíček.
According to MF DNES, the significant release of the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but it should have a far greater impact on the staff of the CME branch in Romania and other countries.
Both new heads of the New Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who took the lead in the long-term director of Adrian Sarbu, spoke to analysts during the mid-term conference talk about wanting to limit all activities that are not directly related to television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce costs for the production of its own series, film and production activities.
In the industrial area of the Czech Republic in Prague, a chilly tower was burned at night
In the industrial area of the Czech Republic in Prague, a high-capacity container was burned, according to firemen, apparently a cooling tower.
"The fire had already been fired on Thursday, 11 hours ago, and the fire had been extinguished this morning," said Pavlín Adamcová, a spokesperson for the Prague firemen.
The amount of pollutants in the ambient air did not exceed the permitted limits as measured.
The damage and causes of the fire are not yet known.
There were about five dozen firemen in the area of Kolben Street.
"It's about the fire of a high-capacity container, probably a cooling tower," Adamc said.
"There is no functional hydraulic network in the area, so we're going to fail using the transport management from the cisterene," she added.
According to the server, cz complicated the closure of the wrong functioning network of hydrants, which was why the firemen had to transport the water.
The firefighter announced the second level of firefight.
There are four degrees in total, in the most serious situations the fourth is reported.
The chemicals were also put out to verify the peace of dangerous substances that could be reached in the fire.
"But they did not aim at the amount of pollutants in the air that would exceed the hygiene standards," the speaker told the firemen.
British police delivered Assange's release notice
The British police today delivered a notice on the release of founder WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who found refuge in the equatorial embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard declared that he had handed Australia a 40-year-old release notice by asking him to go to the police station and that if he did not do so, he might be in danger of being arrested.
Assange, under British law, exhausted his options when the Supreme Court cancelled his appeal against extradition this month, thus facing the issue to Sweden for charges of sexual crimes.
Because he feared that Stockholm would release him to the United States, he was searching for a place of refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he asked for asylum from this South American country.
Scotland Yard "has delivered a 40-year-old release to a man who wants to be delivered to the police station on the day and hour he was assigned," the speaker said.
Assange still violates the terms of the bail.
The Authority rejected the notification of the submission of the submission of comments.
Assange is afraid of being issued from Sweden to the United States, where he can face accusations from the espionage, because on WikiLeaks' website he published 250,000 American diplomatic documents.
The driver got a fine of 1,000 pounds for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs
The motorist got 1,000 pounds for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) from the town of Tiptree in Essex was seen on 27 May in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, she found out he had a cup of tea between his thighs.
At the Colchester Police Court, Howie was accused of driving indiscriminately and indiscriminately.
Its accounts reached seven points, resulting in a six-month ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay the costs of 90 pounds and a contribution for the accused 100 pounds.
As a result of the tax on the owners of foreign properties, the pounding of the London bubble
The Ministry of Finance has calculated the tax on the income of the financial asset in advance, but it is waiting for Mr Osborne's final decision, which in the 2012 budget presented a 7% transfer fee for buildings at a price of over 2 million pounds and annual purchase fees, which are own property within the company rather than as individuals.
The income from the real estate transfer fee in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea periods, which in the tax year 2012/13 reached 708 million pounds, already exceeds the total total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-West, North-West and Yorkshire and Humber together.
Mr Cook said: “Because of the increase in the transfer of property to high-value houses and the presentation of related legislation to prevent tax evasion, it is very difficult to argue that the property of high-value property is not taxed regardless of the effect of the obsolete tax system on the head.”
He added that "this step could have caused some foreign investors to buy properties in London, if any, to sell their current owners".
The first properties – up to 5% to 10% of the housing market at the price – in the rich band that goes from Fulham to Wimbledon recorded an increase of 11.8% in record last year.
The prices in mid- London continue to show steady growth of 5,6 % year after year, but have been stagnant to the 'home market', where, according to a survey, the real estate offices of Savillas have experienced southwestern, north (7,4 %) and east (6,5 %).
Scientists have explained more about the movement of the oasis associated with the dog’s mood
Previous research has shown that a joyful dog turns the oasis of more traffic (from the dog's point of view), while the nervous dogs have the oasis mostly on the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can detect and react to these fine differences in the motion of the eye.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: “People are well aware that the left and right side of the brain have a different link to initiatives that stimulate positive or negative emotions."
We've been trying to keep an eye on other species.
He added that, as is the case with humans, even in dogs, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-wing movements and on the contrary, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to obtain further information on how dogs react to the disproportionate rotation of the tail of other dogs, researchers monitored animals that watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the incidence of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
Probably won't take long before we understand why their watch goes on one side and on the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have proposed to dogs films about dogs – either in the natural version or in the form of silhouettes – that we should get rid of any mufflers, and we have also been able to correct the movement of the oasis and reflect it more on the right or the left."
When the animal saw the dog moving by the side of the road (as far as the dog turning by the side of the tail), it remained completely calm.
However, when she noticed the oasis filming mostly left (reviewed by the oasis-turning dog), their warm frequency increased and the animals acted inconspicuously.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think dogs would communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, it is believed that dogs have learned from experience what moves they must and must not pay attention to.
He said: "If you meet dogs and the movement of their tails in one direction is repeatedly linked to more friendly behavior and the movement of transport produces less friendly behavior, you will react on the basis of this experience."
Researchers say that finding can help dogs, veterinarians and trainers better understand their animal’s emotions.
A dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a high-school veterinary teacher at the University of Bristol, said it wasn't the first study that examined whether the left and right side of the dog were important.
Last year, Lincoln University team found out that dogs turn their heads left when they see the aggressive dog, and the right when they look at the happy dog.
And in another expert consultation from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “The dogs with the robot were most likely to be listed when he turned his back on the left rather than on the left, when he was becoming a non-sistant – on the contrary, contrary to the Italian study.”
According to him, the difference can be made by the fact that dogs in these various animal studies did not fully perform the robots as dogs.
He explained that she could help study how dogs respond to real dogs.
"Although in the case of many different flocks, there is evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be explained – and dogs are not an exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it is likely that it will not take long before we understand why their watch goes on one side and on the other.
Arctic Monkeys for Alexe Turner's disease moved a concert to Glasgow
The Arctic Monkeys rock group moved the concert in Glasgow after the main singer was diagnosed with hrtan inflammation.
The Sheffield group was supposed to go out on Friday in the city complex of Hydro.
The power of the main singer Alex Turner made her move.
The group's announcement came after a similar obligation to postpone the fourth performance in the LG arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, the Arctic Monkeys Group says: “After deciding to postpone today’s LG show in Birmingham, and on the basis of the medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys group must also postpone the presentation in the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday, 1 November.”
"Alexi Turner was diagnosed with hrtan inflammation and unfortunately will not be able to emerge."
The performance in the LG arena in Birmingham will be held on November 20th and the performance in the Hydro complex in Glasgow on November 21st.
All the tickets for this performance remain valid.
We would like to apologize to all those who have bought their tickets for the inconveniences that have caused them.

Pope Francis names the first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope František was the first to name new cardinals of the Catholic Church.
Cardinals in the clergy of the Catholic Church have the highest position right after the pope and are those who choose the pope, so František will establish his first group of men who will finally help choose his successor.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
As soon as the cardinal reaches the age of 80, however, the election of the pope is no longer possible – the group is thus reduced to 120 elective cardinals.
In a statement announcing this report, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican speaker, said that before the celebration of the new cardinals, a meeting of current cardinals known as the Consistorium would be held.
"The Pope has decided to declare his decision to allow the February Consistency ahead to facilitate the planning of other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from various parts of the world," Lombardy said.
Jack Valero from the Catholic Voices list said the number of electing cardinals is likely to fall into the fall.
He said that the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes to increase the number of voters to 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wants.
Consistency next year will be important because it will be the first time František was elected this March, Valero said.
At this point, there are some guidelines for Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope appoints cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of the Roman Catholics are in South America, but they only have an incomplete number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since František set up the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, which has given the task of finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope decided everything for himself.
"Now František chose these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was "very possible", that these cardinals asked for advice.
But we haven't been in this situation before – it's just news.
Valero said that the popes traditionally increased the position of the cardinals of the bishop from large places, but František is "full surprise – so we don't know who he's calling".
GM is downloading some new light-duty cars in the United States for repair of the seats
According to Friday's announcement from the US Auto Safety Authority General Motors, nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) light-duty cars Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra are downloading to repair the problem with the manual loading of the plant.
In some of these vehicles, the mechanism may have to be applied to the front seats of the vehicle.
As a result, seat belts are not in accordance with the federal car safety standards for head restraints.
A notice posted on the State Road Safety Management (NHTSA) website says that “if the rear-view vehicle gets hit, the head restraint does not have to protect passengers correctly, which increases the risk of damage”.
Downloaded models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The GM introduced a supply to the market in June, and for this front American car it is the most important placing on the market since the restructuring of the car after bankruptcy in 2009.
The company GM informed the supplier of the competition in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the owners' announcement due to the 16-day government failure, which weakened the growth of car sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra supplies, which were processed for the 2014 models, stood at around 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, declared GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models from its deliveries.
The shares at the New York Stock Exchange grew by 1.4 per cent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
A Zoufal scream of Obama's voters
I chose both times – I shared the hope of a possible change
Says Obama's honest efforts have destroyed the Republican Party's obstruction
Obstruction policy cannot excuse Obama’s passions for health care or attacks of unmanned aircraft
Obama's 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could happen
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying medicine in Harvard the second year.
In these days, I read a very sad book.
I thought about this book, during the dark days of my second year in medical school, would encourage and restore hope in me.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and is a memory of the President's campaign Barack Obama in 2008.
When I finish the patient's judgment tonight and go to bed, the book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and shows took your breath.
The elections ended with the victory and television news forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My associates cried out joyfully, and my parents hid the papers they had received.
In the White House, he directed a young team of visionaries, and the nation was ready to change.
During the introduction to the Office in 2008, Obama had 82 per cent of its support.
And this is where I close the book.
Going to the present is a tough awakening, like talking out of a dream.
It is difficult to recall these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of the missed opportunities.
In the years after I entered my first election card, there really was a change.
It was definitely nothing of what I imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes – from the law on affordable care through the withdrawal of our armies from Iraq and the end of the policy "not to ask anything, not to say anything" after the death of Usám bin Ladina.
I am also convinced that the party obstructions have lost so much effort to move our nation forward: among other things, it is immigration reform, the possibility of the public choosing health care and the closure of the base in Guantaná.
But after many situations, when I defended Obama's administration from colleagues and friends, I grew up to an absolute limit as to the explanation they could provide.
I felt political hopelessness in the place.
The structure of the Republicans cannot explain the agreement with the listening of foreign leaders or the flow of unmanned aircraft killing innocent children in the sea.
It cannot be explained to them that the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans, or that it pursues those who reveal the wrong conduct of the government.
They cannot be held responsible for the correction of Anwar al-Awlakí, an American citizen, without proper courts or for limiting public contributions and expenditure during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify finding a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are "more unaggressive ... than Nixon's administration".
And more recently, they cannot even apologize for the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the law on the availability of easy website care.
I don't know if anything like this could happen.
Should I have known in 18 years that the government might be opposed to the political campaigns that preceded it.
The volunteer function obviously has no predictable duration and our public talks will create an opposition political party and random events, such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I mentioned above appear to be to a large extent the result of the administrative decision.
And it hurts the most.
I chose both of them again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a controversial and unscrupulous alternative, and it seemed as if he could not secure his policy or position.
I felt that the second functional period for Obama, released from the pressure of future elections, would fill the hopes that we had ever heard of.
However, the return to 2008 – with Obama’s support this week falling below 45% – is more difficult through this book.
I'm forced to remind myself of the many promises they've lost.
This week, I read in the book the chapter about how Obama suffered a bitter defeat with Clinton in the capitals of Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to the tempo and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The ideas expressed in this comment are exclusively the opinions of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer argues that the president of the government Tony Abbott is at the forefront of the parental leave program
The billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer say that the president of the government, Tony Abbott, is very concerned about the parental leave program, because his daughters can get tired and tired of it.
The Banyan magnet, which runs a dispute over the carbon tax dimension of $6 million, made this claim when he tried to get rid of the table of the question whether it was in the middle of interest.
Palmer's United Party may hold up to four votes in the Senate, which play a key role in deciding whether to collect taxes from coal and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could be at the centre of interest, and added that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they might have had personal benefits from the policy.
"He got into a great deal of interest as regards paid parental leave, because if any of his daughter was pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether she would receive parental leave," said Palmer.
Two months after the election of the electoral commission, Mr Palmer officially declared himself the winner of the Fairfax chair in the Sunshine Coast area due to the success of 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Dcery Tony Abbotta Frances in Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closing of the elections?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come, tap details into the computer, vote immediately and have results at midnight?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of charges for marking ballots.
Is it that the results can fade if someone doesn't like it?
In these days and at this time, the use of knives seems unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission has been studying the possibilities of electronic voting and has recently made a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer (59) said that his political programme also applies to the airport in Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new work “very seriously”.
The Public Service is a public service.
"We do not seek any reward except that we can serve companies at this critical time," he said.
Do you wash your hands?
The scientists found out he's washing your hands and hands.
The experiment involved 98 people divided into three groups.
The first two were tasked with solving an unresolved role.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group that washed their hands after they were not healthy had a much more optimistic feeling than the one where her participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the group "with their hands washed" in another test led better than the other one.
Nevertheless, those who washed their hands were rewarded with worse results in other tests than those who were not washed.
The results of the "dead" were at the level of the third group, whose participants did not record any previous failure.
The results of the tests show, according to psychologists, that body purity removes truly negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, there's less motivation, tests have to focus much more on further tests.
If we were to transfer the results of the research to the Czech Republic, we would probably be the most optimistic when we returned from the toilet.
After using the toilet, the hands do not have only one percent of Czechs and Czechs, but the road to the city transport is five.
Most of the people in the toilet are also glued after working in the garden or at work, where 85 percent of the people wash their hands.
Watching a pet motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent study revealed that there is a difference in perception of the Czechs and the Slovaks, as much as it is necessary to wash hands after handing a stranger.
In this situation, the hands wash 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks.
Research has shown that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be in place, I am afraid that reality is different and people are trying to make themselves a little better," commented skin doctor Claudia Komárková.
RBS suspends two traders with foreign currency
According to two persons informed of the situation, the Scottish Royal Bank (RBS) suspends two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another sign that the global investigation by the control authorities of suspicious monetary machinery is increasingly frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with the competent authorities in investigating the world's largest financial market, where each day the owners change USD 5.3 billion.
The two traders would be the first employees of RBS to be suspended in the context of an expanding investigation, which would respond to the scandal with the manipulation rate of LIBOR (London interbank interest rate).
The Bank refused to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
"Our intrusive investigation in this matter continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and our other authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people who are close to this event stated that RBS has transmitted to the UK financial institution the e-mails and quick messages sent from the accounts and to the accounts of the former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and is expected to be released from his current position as European Trade President with foreign currency at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European President of cash trading in Cita, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, the former currency manager in Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
Not one of these traders was charged with any offense.
In the group of Mr. Usher to send quick messages, bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, said people dedicated to this event.
This week, the Bank of UBS stated that after the Swiss control body Finma announced that it was investigating suspicious machinery on the market with foreign currency in several Swiss banks, it took action against some of its employees.
At least six offices worldwide – the European Commission, Finland, the Swiss Antitrust Office Weko, FCA, the Ministry of Justice in the United States and the Monetary Office in Hong Kong – are examining the claims that these bankers have come together to move with the currency market.
In addition, people informed the situation that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had submitted an internal investigation or received an application from the competent authorities.
The banks are examining the years with the old fast news and e-mails to find cases of some offenses.
The investigation reports scared traders in the area, which was one of the largest engines to generate profit in the closures of investment banks in the past years, but which was disturbed by the fact that a small drop in currency has limited opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation by claiming that with a large and highly liquid market with foreign currency it is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say it doesn't necessarily have to be true.
The highly established trader said that despite the significant volume of daily trading with foreign currency liquidity exploration between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platform, "you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices."
The report came on Thursday, when Credit Suisse announced that this week she had missed out on her department for trading with the shares of the trader, who had lost almost USD 6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank shall immediately notify the competent authorities and cooperate with their supervisory authorities.
"We are convinced that this trader has acted alone and that this problem has been solved," Credit Suisse stated.
The number of HIV infected in Prague exceeded a thousand
Doctors in Prague have reported more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the survey in 1986 to the end of the third quarter of this year, the tests confirmed a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This results from the national reference laboratory statistics for the AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to it, 2,063 were infected throughout the Czech Republic.
Immune failure is already resolved in 396 patients.
198 people died.
The number of infected in the Czech Republic has increased every year in the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed infections in 50 people, five years later they were 121.
In 2009, the investigation revealed 156 new diseases and then 180 in 2010.
The number before him fell to 153 years ago, but he was on the contrary record.
According to the lab, they were 212.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year, I think there is no doubt," says the expert on AIDS Miroslav Hlavatý, who has been leading the Prague Light House for years.
From October to the end of the year 2011, the tests revealed a disease in 39 people and last year at 47, Hlavaty introduced.
In September doctors reported 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of surveillance until the end of September HIV tests were confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women.
Immortal AIDS broke out in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Anyone who really wants to know a city should go to the graves.
His visit reveals more than a walk through the centre with monuments, churches and galleries than he would have imagined.
Lots of people read from the graves.
The graves are slowly shaken and gain an intimate view of local reality.
They find out what kind of people here live, what nations, what faiths, how large and consistent families they belong to, how old they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, their taste.
And from the state of the graves, they'll find out how they care for their dead.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's Health Care Act
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the health care law signed by Barack Obama is in accordance with the constitution, which is a fundamental victory for Obama's administration.
By a vote of 5:4 the Court decided that the individual regulation of the Law on the Protection of Patients and Available Care – which orders citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or threatens them to pay fine – does not support the Constitution on the basis of government tax powers.
The President of the Court John Roberts stood on the side of four more liberal members, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also supported the remaining parts of the Law on 2700 pages and further decided that the legal requirement for health care, which orders States to extend the possibility of obtaining sick insurance, would otherwise threaten to lose all financing of sickness insurance from federal sources, is not coercive and contrary to the constitution.
The complaint for blocking this law has been filed by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises.
During the spring of 2012, the law strongly rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
For the word "Mugabe is a bullet hole" no longer threatens prison, the court has annulled the law
Until now, the Zimbabweans have had to pay close attention to the public talk about the 90 - year - old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the beginning of the 1980s, since the end of 1987.
According to paragraph 33 of the criminal law, for the sake of derogating from the presidential authority, the penalty of $100 was one year of deprivation of liberty.
"State representatives should not blame the people who comment on the president in their homes or in other public places," the representatives of the Constitutional Court declared.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will withdraw from the decision of the court, the British BBC reported.
Against the law, a number of injured Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, who were arrested by the police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in a fight with a police officer at the bar.
In May, he ended up in prison with an opposition activist serving in Mugabe's public service with a "cuckling oscillation".
In August, the prosecutor charged a man for his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as a toilet paper.
The Court also declared an anti-constitutional law restricting the freedom of the media.
"The state cannot punish people whose declaration will later prove to be false," said the Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwe’s law has allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
"The existence of a law that enables someone to criminalise for a false declaration has a freezing effect on the right to speak freely," Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, in March Zimbabwe, on the basis of the referendum, a new constitution with broader civil freedoms was adopted.
A small step from one man’s dictatorship took place in 2009, when the agreement between Mugabe and the opposition led to the premiere of Morgan Tsvangiraj.
However, the country continues to face the economic crisis and by 2008 the world's highest inflation, which has exceeded 100,000 per cent.
In 2009, the government therefore completely abolished the national currency.
Today, only the currencies of other countries are applied in Zimbabwe.
The proposed economy is on the edge of Mugabe's unrelenting agricultural reform.
In 2000 he rediscovered the land of white farmers between his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience walking.
Central banks will keep swap lines persistent
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fedem, the Bank of England and the Central Banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument that will allow banks access to global currencies whenever needed.
The banks put it in their joint statement.
"It's a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow, the leading international economist of the London Bank of Barclays.
"I will cover all the transitional instruments of this type gradually become permanent, so it is not according to my surprise," adds Vojtěch Benda, the chief economist of BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening the momentum that began to emerge in 2007 when the international credit market first collapsed.
The Central Bank agreements allowed access to Euros, Dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The decision of the central bankers comes at a time when the US Fed is preparing to complete its US economy support programme, which could avoid the price of money on the global market even higher.
The swap contract shall be used by default to overcome the lack of liquidity of one currency at the current liquidity surplus of another currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a loan of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in the European Bank.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will monitor 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not) lacks personal data.
More than a year ago, I made registration on Tipsport.cz pages.
But then I didn't finish it because someone was sitting on the sidewalk who wasn't supposed to finish the internet registration.
And because I didn't want to drive to the other side, the registration went down, and then I moved, and that changed my address and the number of the public address.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told that it didn't work because I had another OP number, the address, and that it just didn't work out, and that I had to ask for data deletions and carry out a new registration.
So I did that, and on 24.10.2013 I wrote in technical support that I asked for the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable privacy law.
The spirit of the day has written me technical support that I have the registration to finish on the sidewalk.
This started a marathon of e-mails for technical support, where finally after the 4th of August 25.10, they wrote that personal data on my request had been deleted.
So a person would say that he could carry out that new registration and here they started problems again first wrote to me that my username is already contained (I don't understand it was deleted - it's not about personal data, but finally it was deleted too).
So I used a different user name and jumped up on me that my personal data had already been stored to complete the registration on the counter (how can they have stored something that they claim to have deleted?), so I contacted again with technical support.
On my question, how could I have been told that personal data really deleted 25.10. and that I would send an e-mail with that error.
I did that (last about 15 hours yesterday) and I was told today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that this is why I did not do it because I used the same name and date of birth.
What about the fact that I've been in touch with technical support for a week and I'm deciding that it's not going to work.
And what if the truth is what it claims (if it is not) no one could register with the same name or date of birth if this is already registered.
By the way, in those 13.22 I actually registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used the supposed e-mail and phone number and wild worlds, I found out that I had been sent to the e-mail to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if it cannot be registered on the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport weighs registration on e-mail and phone number and data just didn't figure out how he claims.
So I once again told technical support that they're just lying (whether deliberately or not) because what they're writing is not true.
I've shown several screens that the registration problem was already before 31.10. So the "false" registration doesn't have any effect on this.
Tipsport has given me a strict sentence - I'm sorry, but because you're already registered again, we can't check your claims.
And the communication's over.
Respect repeats the same sentence that the registration is valid on the name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on that link in the e-mail and thus did not even proceed.
So if I cut it off, Tipsport not only did he not erase the data as he claims, but he's still lying when he claims otherwise.
Worse, it's easy to prove how they're lying and trying to make it look like he's on the side of the customer.
By the way, following the introduction of this issue on my personal blog, things got a little moving and e-mail came from Technical Support that the issue is being submitted for verification and will be informed (after a week of urgency and detection and notice of the same mistake).
In the meter on the City plays music
Transport company Hl.m. (DPP) Prague launched the music project in the meter.
The first vestibule, where during the operation of the meter continuously plays reproduced instrumental music, is the Bridge of Line A on the exit to Václav Square.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Horaček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
Textarář Michal Horáček has brought his new two-CD Czech calendar to the hall of the Colinska City Social House, but especially in the series between us songs Lenku Novo, Františka Segrada and Ondru Rumla accompanied by the excellent orchestra Matěj Benka.
After the intruder and the late musician’s essay, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, himself came with the candle in his hand and recalled the story of the last of them playing in Kolín and in the theater and the city as a whole.
"Otherwise, two types of carts were produced in Cologne, with which I came in contact with a lot," he recalled.
So did President Zeman's parents.
"Maybe we could make tours after the Zakolane or Dúbravce at Bratislava," he remarked about the parents of other presidents.
Several times a night, Horáček, who did not leave his sights and if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new music scene.
The calendar also made Joseph Mánes, who gave her an eagle, about ice hockey, but once in a while he didn't know anything about how we meet in those places and we're scandalizing who doesn't jump, it's not Czech.
It's also called a song from the Czech calendar, but we're not playing here today," he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang from this board for him if he could sleep well during the day, sing at night, and accompany him to the guitar.
Otherwise, if he did not sing, played percussion, all three singers then accompanied the band in the composition of the keyboard, cello, guitar and contrabas.
All three vocalists sang together a little respirator To the site of the heart is sitting, which immediately spread its gaze.
"I'm glad that the song caught you, which didn't surprise me in the village of Kmoče," answered Michal Horáček.
After the memory of Peter Hapku, I was introduced by Františka Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller, who was rewarded with a huge applause, Hanu Heger's song again reminded Father of his love for Lid Baar and with Horáček's explanation of the Communist ban and the replacement of Baar's American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocába recalled the composition of Sebastian, then Segrado sang the beautiful composition of Prague by Jard Svobodou, the stepparent and the former Kolíňák.
But it was already a conclusion, a relief in the stand and an addendum in the form of optimistic composition We live in a wonderful time.
One more addition was prepared on the playlist, but the fans were no longer out there.
Nearly immediately after the concert, the whole quarter sat behind the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horaček his books and even the package from the legendary LP and took pictures with any interested ones.
Berdycha with Szpópánka will add Rosal and Hájek
At the finish of the Davis Cup against Serbia appointed a non-playing Czech tennis captain Jaroslav returned to four Tomáš Bergych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukas Rosol, Jan Hajek.
The Czech trophies defend the trophies, but they go to play the game rivals in the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from November 15th to 17.
The finals are Czech third in the last five years.
"We know we're going to a hot land, it's gonna be wild, and we've always got to focus on our performances."
"Let's go there with the only goal - to get three points and sell it the best," said Štěpanek, the winner of the last-day final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
School for Obama, how to bomb Syria.
American team in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis have just described what Syria's bombing is like.
Without unnecessary loss, threats, and millions of declarations, they sent planes, you hit the target, and she came back.
They would not be allowed to interfere with the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
All the actions refuse to confirm and no longer express themselves.
The exact opposite, confused and big-ass, the actions of unassisted Obama's Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying in the whole attack was what the Israelites bombed.
Don't let the media fool themselves by their claims that it was bombarded by "syrian base" or "deliveries for Hizbaláh".
Recently I wrote here that while US aid to secular rebels in the country remains only on rhetorical level, Russia is happy to continue to supply Syria with weapons.
And the very fresh supply of Russian rockets released in the port of Latakia has become an Israeli emergency.
Clear message.
And notice, Israel again bombed Asad's regime, not the rebellion, although it was supposed to be the opposite, according to popular Internet theories.
The U.S. government appointed 2 members of the space units, probably Delta forces.
It has not been understood until now that they were marked during the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi.
It is known that the heroic death of the two former SEALs members who were tearing down the CIA area in the city was, in my opinion, the members of the CIA's secret team, which is made up of former soldiers.
For a long time, what SEALs did was speculated on the consulate or even elsewhere located in the CIA residence.
It's clearer now.
Any information that the CIA in Libya has its official protected by clumsy nests (right on one of these two SEALs members killed after the mine action) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising are the information about those two unknown heroes.
They were part of the American team in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the report of the attack in Benghazi they volunteered to join the attack and, along with five private contractors, they made their way to the CIA area in Benghazi.
It is a shame to the administration that during that attack, that command was not officially and completely imposed and that it was just a matter of what to do.
Commander of the team, so without orders, they'll probably release these volunteers.
In any case, the fact that the country is acting not on a one-time basis, but on an ongoing basis, US team, CIA agents and private contractors are quite interesting information.
And since there has been no formal recognition of such a thing until recently, and even now only some NATO advisory mission in Libya is being discussed.
But it's good that the United States is trying half-heartedly to torture terrorism in Libya.
Even if it would be much more helpful to solve the state situation.
The last place in the secret and permanent conflict that I want to write today is the coast of Iran.
It's not so long ago the media almost gave up Iranian air force for the extraction of American drones.
Little is known, however, how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to show up your drone in the airspace, you can't do anything about it.
However, if Iranian drones are found in international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom was tracking an American drone in an international sea space when it was possible to first-class U.S. super hitter F-22 Raptor in history.
He flew Phantom to make an optical check on his weapon without recording it on the radar or just observing it, and then when he suddenly appeared to him and called on an Iranian pilot to return home, he listened unreputably.
It's no wonder that Phantom is a million-year-old of American production, but he remembers the war in Vietnam.
He can't compare himself with Raptor.
We want to show that Plzeň can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's a little paradox.
While his team has not been successful lately, the defender or hostage Victoria Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form that brought him back to the representation after a year.
He's also got gunshots, he's got activity, and after he's gone to Teplí, he's got a fine set.
Victoria scored in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice after victory, but finally she took one point from these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes that his team is breaking up with Jablon.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we will defeat the Jablonec at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The team is preparing carefully for a hard fight with the Northmen who play the attack football.
It's all about fighting with Jablonce, the coach is preparing us well, as we always get a lot out of the video game rival.
"I believe it will be a great match Friday night," the Czech fan's representative at the Doosan Arena tribunal.
The final fights didn't work out the way she wished, but Victoria's word of crisis denied.
So it goes into football, sometimes you're in good shape and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis in any way.
"I believe we'll win on Friday and it'll be good again," says the Defender of the West.
Victoria's team will once again rely on fan support.
"It's Friday night, and that's what I'd like our fans, who are great, to invite."
"I believe we'll give them a win," Rajtoral adds.
Jana Péťová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really about a step, it's about a big leap - a leap back a few years, and that's to remember, to my childhood.
It's a reminder of what it was like to have no worries and just come from school and wash the dishes, evaporate and do tasks.
Even though these "compulsory," it was most of the theory, the desire of parents.
The practice was completely different - coming from school, throwing a bag into the corner and running out.
Play ball games with other kids, jump pancakes.
Then, at Helen's show, and her boys, they're gonna blow up a rare stench of birthday celebrations for Grandma.
And then after a few warnings, finally wash the container, evaporate, in the winter drag wood into brick stones and tasks to do until after seven times under the lamp (or rely on the companion and instead of the tasks to write the beloved version addressed to the school love).
In the morning, eat the homemade strawberry (of real fruit, not the jams that are being sold now, the contents of which are neither of the straw nor of the straw) and drink it with the tea of dried herbs that we and Mom so enjoyed collecting.
I also remember those magical evenings when there were grave silence in the room, when our sister recorded the songs from radio to tapes that were loud in the old casket after Mom.
And then we moved the tapes to the courtroom, and we still played the same song, our favorite song, and we got a syphon.
Or we were calling through the desk using the backrests that were tied to each other - and when we were already on the phone to hear better, it was necessary to clear our ears thoroughly, then the earpiece was the surka + wata.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live in such a way that we missed nothing.
We didn't need any iPhones, iPads ba even mobiles and notebooks or branding.
Clothing was passed from generation to generation and the best "freak" in the dress was a drumstick of domestic production with the help of the SAVA.
From electronics, we had enough of the satisfaction of the so-called casket mom and most of all Walkman, which we shared with our sister, and which we used in the same way only on the train on the school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Kloboučka Hop or Man, don't get angry, or how I've already set out to go "only" out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, and I'm sure his parents were looking for him for a long time, but unfortunately he didn't warm up with us for a long time.
My younger sister broke a bullet into it, or she was so beautiful that she had the tapes, so she tried to see if the bullet was falling.
Unfortunately he fell asleep, but it was his last voice.
Well, and this case has to do today, poor man, on a plate from Dad still.
She says that when Lenka was a kid, she broke a bullet into the video and thought she was overplaying the recipe and didn't beat it, so she can't make it up to this day.
I remember how we all managed to communicate together, make a deal without a cell phone, computers.
Together with my sister, we made a deal with Grandma's granddaughter at the holidays, when we met again next year at Grandma's, and that's how it was.
We've met.
Now promise someone you'll see each other in a year?
I also remember the winter when we and the whole village ran out, built snowflakes, drove on a snowflake at the church on sandstorms.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the last day.
Of course, we listened to the sister before every dinner, the notorically familiar phrase, "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but you certainly don't have a bonded soap in a lemon net in the bathroom.
After dinner, when Dad at the garage "working" at the beer with Jarda from the village, we lay down with Mom on the floor, rubbed our feet on a brick stone, opened the door and looked at the flame and listened to the cracking of wood that ran out of the stone.
We were close - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated together - we talked - we didn't write messages every day through different chats, SMS.
There was nothing like that, and yet we knew more about ourselves.
And that's how I could go on for a long time.
It's nice to remember, especially if I add these memories by looking at the albums, where the black corners of black and white pictures are marked.
And if I didn't happen to know how much it was, behind the picture is always a year of recording.
I can see that although we did not hear the cuts, according to the crowd, and we also had pants for our brother-in-law about two bigger numbers, nobody had a problem with us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather go back on that step forward - into reality.
By 2013, and I'll wait for what modern times will come up with for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of me now are for a young adult generation so at least "hundred years after monkeys" and I think they come in a lot of ways that they won't live this time either.
I'd like that!
Google, Samsung and Huawei companies charged for Nortel's patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents missing Nortel, filed a complaint Thursday to violate the patent against mobile producers, including Google, which was auctioned in the course of Nortel's bankruptcy.
The consortium Rockstar, which bought Nortel's patents for USD 4.5 billion, complained to the US District Court in Texas of Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for breach of the patent.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of breaking seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps to connect the terms sought on the internet with the relevant advertising, states the complaint, which is the core of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately arrested.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are producing phones that operate on the operating system of Google Android, which is highly competitive for mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011 Google made a $900 million price offer for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and finally offered up to $4.4 billion.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar in the fight for patents, Google won a $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility, which was partly motivated by a group of Motorola patents.
“Events fail in trying to obtain patents that are the subject of the dispute, Google has interrupted and continues to fail,” the complaint states.
Rockstar strives for an increased compensation for the damage caused by Google because it believes that the Google patent has been violated intentionally, as the complaint claims.
Miloslava Cepková: November smile
She came outside from four degrees Celsius, which we're not used to yet.
First, she put off her smile, the one who kept giving up her clothes as a defense against the love of friendly environment.
This made her feel a lot better because it was a mask that she decided not to give up on the public.
She was honest at home only in the days when she was a grandmother and had her grandson Elinka or Adika around her.
And, of course, when her sons called.
She remembered a lesson from endless courses of business skills.
Now they're really out of their way.
So she doesn't suck her closest one.
Then he flew to the corner.
It's like a dress on a man's face.
November, no other month can do that miracle to make her really smile, like when they were on a trip with someone who hasn't been here for nearly three years.
Egypt refers to the office of the first freely elected President
Muhammad Mursí made an inaugural oath, but his triumphal day is only difficult to resolve political troubles in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Mursí promised "new Egypt", when he was celebrated as the first freely elected president of this country, after Husji Mubarak, who was held 16 months earlier.
In his introduction to the Office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic President in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the monarchy was cast about 60 years ago.
He made an oath before 18 judges dressed in black talars in a dwelling built with a view to the Nile, which reminds the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are trying for a better tomorrow, new Egypt and the second Republic," Mursí said in a celebration ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"The Egyptian people today laid the foundation of a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said Mursí, a 60-year-old engineer who studied in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, who has been an illegal organisation since its creation for the most part 84 years since the fall of individual governments.
When Mursí arrived in a small car colony shortly after 11 a.m., hundreds of soldiers and policemen were in charge of the building.
Only a few hundred supporters met before the building court to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential occasion of Mubarak's period, transport was stopped only briefly so that the column of the project could normally be moved by a moving road connecting the city centre to the suburbs in the south.
The personal prestige of Mursi, a ridiculously marked "reservative pneumatics" of the Muslim brotherhood, has increased rapidly since his victory and his Friday performance, which was intended to present him not only as a candidate of Islamists, but also all those who wish to bring to the end a rebellion against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursí, dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie to judges in a wooden chamber where he made an oath.
Mursi later traveled to the University of Cairo, where he was to give an opening speech.
While he was watching, he received an official welcome from the military band that played the national hymna.
He was the military commander of the full-fledged marshal Hussain Tantavi.
His income was accompanied by a scandal of “arms and people are one hand” from the mouth of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Kahir was founded in 1908 as the centre of secular education and later became a legacy of Islamic student movements in the 1970s.
Mursí made a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrír Square, a place where a revolution was born that ended the authoritarian government of Mubarak last year, and celebratedly promised to capture again the presidential authority of his office by the military council, which took it away from the expelled leader.
But I agree with making official promises before the court, rather than before Parliament, as usual, he has submitted to the will of the army, which means that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursí's speech at Tahrír Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
In the ghettos there'll probably be police specialists, they're supposed to slow down the tension.
In the Czech ghettos, police specialists should act in the future.
They'd spend half their time here.
They'd watch the order and solve the problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to a reduction in tension between the people of poor places and the inhabitants of the environment.
In his proposal to reduce security risks, he counts the Ministry inside.
According to him, improving the situation in the country would help mainly "fast social housing".
The document has been discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poor homes and a quarter in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people living in them, mostly Roma.
Adults in the ghettos were unemployed, families were dependent on doses, children ended up in "special" schools.
It's a bubbling fluid.
According to the problem location experts, a hundred came in between.
Relationships between their inhabitants and others are escalating.
In a number of places there were anti-Roma walkways.
The extremists were also joined by people from the surrounding area.
According to the inside, police are demanding to maintain security and order in the ghetto areas.
The essential condition is "the consistent application of equal access to the rule of law".
But it is impossible for people to achieve this without a detailed knowledge of the place and people.
A specialist would walk through the ghetto, where he would spend half his services, and the rest would serve in his circuit.
He'd look into the trouble room.
He would also know the locals, so he could better solve problems or offences.
"Thanks to their trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent the whole range of illegal acts," he said.
Specialists in the ghettos would receive supplements, 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers into the problem areas should be built from Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about 15.5 million crowns).
Czech Republic pays 15% of the sum, 85% of the funds.
Preparations started this year, a detailed proposal is being processed.
The project is scheduled to take place until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied to Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded sites is infinitely higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roman settlements," the authors reported.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic, it's not clear yet.
The answer is to give an analysis that determines where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money these members will be able to release the police once the project is completed each year.
According to the draft project, the first election of the police officers will graduate the strike in Slovakia.
This training should take place annually by five dozen members.
The most suitable candidates will come in.
There should also be special training for police officers who will act in the ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
Three categories should be presented inside.
The minimum standard would comply with the accommodation with the exact rules, such as the number of persons per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard would have social apartments that would be comparable to normal housing.
The employees would have to complete an integration plan that would include social workers.
They would have to keep the housing order, take care of their health, send the kids to school, requalified and actively look for work.
If they were to try to join, they would fit into a higher standard of living.
In-house housing systems should function for at least 30 years, until the next generation of "in an integrated environment".
The social housing model prepares resorts for local development and work.
They've got to move him to the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Ugliřský vrch - one of our youngest soups.
The coal mine is an imaginary hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Along with several others, the evidence of the sock activity in the Low Jeseník is recent (geologically).
The last eruptions here were still at the beginning of the quarter.
In view of the greater distance, on the top of the Ugliřsk peak, an imaginary white baroque resort church of Miss Marie Help, built in 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the original wooden drain cap.
The host standing next to the church didn't behave.
Shortly after the church was completed, a row of four Julys was cut off, about 1 km long.
The crossroads at the top of the hill is already the third version, the original one became here after 1916, the second one from 2001 only lasted until 2004.
On the 15 stops are wooden plastics made by the local art painter František Nedmelel.
He used various types of low-seasoned wood.
Similarly, the roots of the mountains in this area form an interesting geological exhibition.
The name of the sponsor shall also be given on each stop.
The coal top is the rest of the young soup.
Although data from radiometric measurements are somewhat different, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
He is therefore younger than the Great Road (age 3.3 million years) and older than the Venušina sop (age 0.8 million years).
The frog was born with an explosion.
It produced a significant amount of sop ash, along with the fragments of the ovens from the floor, which obtained red onion by burning.
At the end of this phase, the lava flowed to the surface - today it is the layer of the steamer up to 13 meters strong.
The second eruption threw red, red, and place to black tufs.
Their layer is strong up to 50 meters and its part is accessible in the wall of the hole.
In the tufts there are imaginary soup pumas large up to 1 meter. And the second eruption was combined with an extract of the lava.
At the end of the activity of the pine, a lava emerges, which today forms up to 50 m of a strong layer of stork.
The juices in which the soaking of the soup with the lava flows is directed are the most common type of soup.
Because they're actually made up of layers, they got the name of the stratovulcan.
The original copper leather was gradually exposed to erosion.
However, he was threatened by the burning of the mountain in the hole on the south side.
The most intense exercise took place in the years 1953 - 1962.
The tufs were added to the concrete, which was then easier and had better heat insulation properties.
The effort has been under the pressure of experts and the public to stop and thus preserve this unique place.
The problem is, however, in the periphery and little consistency of the mountains, which quickly blow up, break apart, and dry down.
The break's getting out pretty fast.
To make the situation even more complicated, it is warm, south-oriented, ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The solution is problematic, but in time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are kept in a number of important locations.
You will reach the Ugliřský top after the green tourist brand from Bruntál, possibly from Slezska Kočov.
Automobiles can use an unpaid parking space at the beginning of the lip alley, where a short scientific path begins.
She moved out of the villa into the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a crime villa with a garden and pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villa districts in Orechovce.
However, the original owners of the house received it back and the tenants had to move away with a small distance.
That's why Ivana was fast looking for a replacement home for herself and her older mother then.
From the well-known people got a tip on apartment 3 + kk in the older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"First of all, it was a shock, but the look from the fourth floor to the vast forest park and the overhaul inspired me on the other side," recalls Ivana for the first sentence.
At first, I thought it was going to be a provisional for three years.
"Today we live here for more than thirteen years and not just for gradual reconstruction, I would not change," the owner adds.
The mother and daughter then moved from a hundred and twenty-metre apartment to a smaller area of 62 m2 and all the equipment was distributed.
The action was not simple, things were compatible with friends and gradual installation lasted almost a year.
The new apartment was in a good condition, but had to make the necessary adjustments, such as door painting or window switching.
The former owner blew up the core, but the owner did most of the unpracticely solved and excessively large chair, and on the contrary the small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
Architects have been used to measure individual zones and to separate the space from the sadrocarton, which has enabled new positioning of lights.
The first move she decided to make after a few years was the removal of the female in the living room.
This apartment has changed its layout to 2 + kk, but the room has gained air and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding green.
Another step towards the partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of the PVC floor for laminate.
Ivan didn't know about the bathroom.
For years, I picked up the housing magazines and looked for inspiration.
I recently discovered an interesting realization in one of them.
So, for my recommendation, I spoke to young architect Kamil Douder.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," said Ivan.
Thanks to the refurbishment of the bathroom, it was also possible to modify the furniture.
The architect connected the room with the bathroom and the two doors with the opening wings replaced with the one moving, saving the place.
The bathroom is overtime and also quite unbarrier.
The quality beads imitate the peacock, in addition to a comfortable seat in the shower, the bidet spray at the toilet.
Successful cooperation with Kamil Douder continued.
Within the order How the dream was built was a quick, but fundamental change in the living room, which was also shared by architect Martin Čeněk.
To the space created by the combination of two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without helping ourselves with the classic principles of optical division, such as semi-trailers or Japanese walls.
"This would result in a breach of the openness and unity of the space," explains the architect.
Originally, it was possible to separate the sleeping and living area.
It was enough to turn the back of the two sofas and build between them in peace the made box on the feathers.
The food corner clears the walls of the floors and paints.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining area, the architect used quality marble, the moving door revived with a pattern.
The kitchen corner shall, if necessary, cover the moving panels with the wallpaper.
The new floor of antiallergenic marble has, in contrast, a number of advantages from laminate: soft, non-slip surface without spasm and better sound insulation.
A system of cutoffs and previews of the highlighted colour is an indication of how space can be worked in the panel.
I left the colors on the architects, I wish it was happy.
"I love Orange, I had the same percentage in my previous apartment," says Ivana.
The graphboard with the motive of the colorful magnolia is practical and creates a remarkable aesthetic element.
To the warm energy tone, the architects chose a white, which supported the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, books were saved, among other things, into space under no parapets.
It's all about reaching, the lamps are comfortably controlled away.
In the processed interior, the contrast of the new one works perfectly with the older one, for example, with dozens of years of old Christian mirrors and with the quality of the art that Ivana collects throughout her life.
The last one came to the kitchen.
The boxes were first placed on both sides and the owner looked a bit like in the tunnel.
The architect took their number and changed the location.
The furniture in a simple design is made on the order, the white surface slightly softens the perennial surface.
They went into the small space thanks to the invented solution of the washing machine, the dryer and the mouse.
The view of the small kitchen restored a glass of walls on the desktop.
The unique graph with a digitally printed motif is attractive, and it is excellently maintained.
Ivana chose the flowers of magnolia that remind her of the favorite neighborhood she had lived in for years.
Now she seems to be happy here.
In the original bathroom there was a small bath and washbasin, the new owner picked a neutral percentage of the bet.
The big shower corner has a glass door Ronal.
The task was to create a clear, simple space from the environment in which functions and equipment will be in harmony.
The interior was made of material and colourful, and we tried out for its elegant, cozy, not too crowded view.
"The next condition of the task was a non-barrier solution with minimum obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around furniture and the availability of items of daily needs," Kamila Doudérová adds.
The Supreme Court has ruled: Sometimes it can be reached.
The Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Petra Untimee may also be found guilty of any criminal acts that he could have committed before the August resolution of the Embassy.
It was protected only by procedural immunity, which relates to demonstrations in Snow White.
In the case of former Members of ODS Ivan Fuksy, Mark Šnajdra and Petra Tluchoře, on the contrary, he decided that he could not be punished for any criminal offences until last November they gave up the mandate, said speaker of the Supreme Court Petr Knötig.
By this decision, the Court rejected the proposal of the State representative, Iva Ishtvana, who wanted to continue in criminal proceedings with the MPs.
According to him, they received a fee in the form of lucrative positions in state firms for giving up a mandate and not having problems with the adoption of laws.
On the contrary, the former prime minister who offered these posts can continue to be reached.
With the Vít Bartou also detained the anti-corruption police officer
Bart's advocate Oldrich Chudoba, who also represented her in the cause of alleged corruption of VV MPs, also did not want to comment too much on the case, but said, "Yes, I represent my client in this matter too, but in view of the protection of hidden facts, I cannot continue to comment."
According to the information, the case is handled by the General Inspection of Safety Committees (GIBS).
The server said Bart could buy hidden information from the police.
According to the Prime Minister.cz, the case may have been related to the cause of former police president Peter Lessy, whose appointment to the function of Bart was allegedly attempted.
The latest information, however, shows that the detention of Vita Barty with Peter Lessy is not related.
The spokesperson for the police president, Eva Kropáčová, refused to comment on the case of the Prague City Representation.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of hidden realities," said Mr. Štěpánk Zenklova, spokesperson of the City State Representative in Prague on Friday.
It is precisely that the Bart's case is being monitored by the prosecutor, and its words do not directly imply that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted in the concealment regime.
The reporter Novinek managed to catch up with his wife, Vita Barty Katerín, in the morning before their home in Prague, Klarov.
She just loaded the bags into the car and left.
She refused to comment on the whole event.
On Friday morning, the leader of the movement, Tomio Okamura, expressed himself to Bart's detention.
According to his words, he doesn't even know what's going on in the case.
"The life of Bart was one of many candidates many parties to our candidates, and as I said repeatedly before the elections, he was not even a member of the Uzvita direct democracy of Tommy Okamura," he added.
Vit Bart, who in previous early elections to the Sniemovny in the Plzeńsk region failed to successfully run for the move to destroy the direct democracy of Tommy Okamura, is known for its corrupt cause of the payoff of MPs in public matters.
In April 2012, he was wrongly sentenced to 18 months with a 30-month delay.
Later, the verdict was changed and Bart was acquitted.
I want a contract in NHL.
I still have the juice, the desire and the enthusiasm
For Prospala, she was always the first to have a family, so she wanted to be fully subordinate in her 38 years.
Either he gets a job in the sea and he's still going on his career or he's definitely going to end up with a hockey game.
"I want to fulfill my father's and my husband's roles."
"I'm so glad," says the hockey player, who is still looking forward to the offer.
In spite of this, he's a declared employee who never gets a chance to do anything.
Despite the fact that she leaves her heart on the ice every time, she can cut off the co-players.
And despite the fact that he was the most productive player of Columbus's last season.
"But the desire to show everyone is still in me," they say decisively.
Maybe she's waiting, apparently it's about New York Rangers, who didn't get into the season, and they've got two injured attacks -- attackers Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
How does your arrival at Rangers look?
It's just speculation.
Unless I have something on the paper, it's not worth doing.
I know an article came out in the New York Post, that they should sign me, but that's all.
It's never been added, it's really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce to myself that I have a contract, but it just isn't.
Didn't they even call you from the club?
Such communication in NHL takes place every day.
That's what it's about to get into a situation where the deal really comes.
When the player gets hurt, or it's not going to happen to anyone, and the manchaft doesn't slip.
There's a lot of different factors that have to meet together to get this contract.
But similar circumstances happen in New York, right?
Rick Nash is injured with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't get into the season, so there's a certain chance there's, don't you think?
Of course, that's always the chance.
The second thing is that you always need two sides.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't got one yet.
Unfortunately, it's the reality I have to live in.
You're flying to America on Friday, are you expecting something to just blow up?
I have that expectation since July 5, when the NHL opened up the market with free players, and it's still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
No, I'm going to Tampy for the kids and the wife.
I look forward to the sun when I see you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
That's because I'm a father and a husband, and that's what it's all about.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a deal and I don't play games.
So I'm going to fulfill my father's and my husband's role, and I'm looking forward to it.
It's a Christmas for me and my family when we can go support our kids in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in the import tickets for full consideration?
Of course, a person can think of a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games for knee surgery.
Too much and too much fun.
Once it gets to such a stage that all the corners, the winnings and the tapes don't make you what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Have the job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing anyone could ever see me except my family.
You've had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play NHL just because it's NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I'm a hockey player, I'm in the first place -- apart from the family -- it's also a sports success.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's where family life comes from.
My children, so sorry, our children - my women - grew up in the States, started going to school and so on.
And we would be very pleased if they continued in this trend.
Because what we're going to do is in America, there's a possibility of it somewhere else.
We should offer them such a chance.
So you're planning on staying in America all the time?
We'll practice it as we do now.
This means that in summer we will be in the Czech Republic on the Deep and around the Czech Budjejovic.
And again in the winter in Tampea or where our steps lead us.
It's perfectly perfect, to be still warm.
I've had great luck in my life.
It's been said that I went contrary to him, it became a lot of strength and denial and it took a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey has offered me a lot of options, and this is one of them.
That we and our wife can choose where to live.
There are a lot of people in the world who want to be able to choose what they will do and how they will live.
How long in your life will you be willing to work hard to train and wait for an offer?
Yeah, so that's the question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the desire, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have on the NHL that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it'll stay there.
That can't be planned.
So it can be said that you're waiting for this season to come out and then decide what to do?
I'm at a stage when I'm going from day to day.
The Director-General of the Czech Republic has recently announced that the Decision on the construction of the 3rd and 4th power plant Temelín will be postponed at the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for a new State energy concept and by agreeing to the Contracts of Differences by the government.
The current ČEZ management is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, to the majority shareholder.
However, a qualified manager should make recommendations to shareholders and not hide behind him.
Grandma: I only rule with Sobotka.
Andrej Babish is beginning to calm down that his movement of the UN will not have time to learn the political momentum in the opposition and that it will have to go straight to the government to create something at all.
The President of the United Nations has admitted this in the debate on the Law that will come tomorrow.
Trade and marketing ŠkoFIN leads Abraham
Its competence includes the area of product and marketing and the strengthening of cooperation with business partners.
He replaced Mr. Shantor in his office.
For the past 14 years, Abraham has linked his career to the car sector.
He worked in Toyota Motor Czech, then in Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for the seven years of the Alfa Romeo brand and dealers.
His last position was Suzuki Motor Czech, in which he held the position of car manager for over five years.
SchkoFIN was born in 1992.
Police evacuated because of the shooting at the Los Angeles airport.
At an international airport in Los Angeles, they shot themselves in the morning.
That's why the police evacuated a part of the airport, and it was supposed to be a terminal three.
The Reuters agency with a call to the California media claims that men of law have shot an armed man with a gun.
Los Angeles Times, referring to the police, stated that there was a shooter in which between two and three members of the Security Administration were injured in transport.
How many people have been completely injured and whether some victims are still invisible.
The Hasics are talking about events with a larger number of injured people.
CNN: Israel bombed the military base in Syria.
The goal should be Russian missiles for Hisballáh.
Israeli military aircraft allegedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
With a call from the unnamed US government, CNN broadcasts this.
The Israeli printing of an explosion in the reported storage site reported a wide range of rockets, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
The Israeli military spokesperson for CNN's question refused to comment on the incident.
"We do not comment on reports from foreign media," she said.
According to the US government's missile and related equipment, Israelis thought that they could be transported to the Lebanese militant movement Hizballáh.
The AP Agency, with a reference to another US security factor, informed that the Russian rockets SA-125 were the target of an Israeli raid on the Syrian territory.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the purpose of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defence system.
Satellite images of the attack area, but according to the DPA agency, the Russian rockets of type S-125 Neva showed.
In addition, they saw the SA-3 battery including the command center with radar to monitor the rockets and their targets.
According to the Israeli TV report, the recorded missiles have a peak of 35 kilometres and could carry a weight of 70 kilograms.
Israel has already reportedly bombed missile supplies inside Syria this year at least twice, the CNN and AP have introduced.
The Israeli army never responded to such reports, but repeatedly declared that it would affect any delivery of weapons to Hizballah or other terrorist groups.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
The Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company updated the annual profit estimate and expects record profits from recruits in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects its annual basic tax profit to move between USD 325 million and USD 340 million compared to USD 305 million to USD 315 million from the previous forecast.
If the current development is maintained, it will represent a 12-to seventeen-percent increase in the record profit of $290.4 million from 2011/12.
Director General Graham Turner said that Flight Centre created eight per cent profit in the first half and in the second half began a sharp growth mainly in Australian and British travel outside the service journey.
"To date, our 10 countries are profit-making, and several focus on record annual profit before growth and tax," he said.
This is Australia and the United Kingdom, which are traditionally our biggest producers of profit.
During the second half of Australia, recreation business rose, which compensates for a slightly weaker domestic market with business travel.
Similarly, in the United Kingdom, Flight Centre was well run in the recreational area, while business customers lost less.
The American trade is lost during the seasonally weaker half-years and is expected to bring a third in a row of annual profits.
Flight Centre's shares were 3 cents above the level of $38.20 yesterday.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia moved to Petrohrad
Eco-activists detained from September in Russia for protest against planned oil extraction in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to Petrohrad.
She informed the AFP agency today with an appeal to the International Greenpeace Environmental Organisation.
At the same time, she claims that the original charge of her anti-piracy activists has not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International learned from diplomatic sources that thirty men and women, detained in Russia after an inviolable action against the Arctic oil rig, were transferred from a repair facility in Murmansk to a prison in Petrohrad," the organisation announced in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA agency, the move was planned.
Ecological authorities first accused piracy, which threatened them for 15 years in prison in the event of a sentence.
Last week, however, they announced that this charge would compensate for a smaller expropriation, which threatens the lower penalty with the upper limit of seven years of deprivation of liberty.
However, in today's statement, Greenpeace pointed out that the government's piracy charges have not yet been dropped as promised.
This means that detention is now accused of two criminal acts.
The Powerful Investigation Committee announced last week that the charge of piracy would be replaced by the charges of expropriation.
However, when thirty prisoners stood before the committee this week, the charge of piracy was not dropped.
Instead, a new charge was imposed on everyone," the AFP quoted from Greenpeace's statement.
The Russians held three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries in half of Gazprom's oil rig.
Ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise boat, swimming under the Dutch flag.
Since then, all of them have been held in custody against which they have appealed, but the court has rejected them all.
Environmentalists complain about conditions of imprisonment.
The Executive Director of Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo, according to the AFP, today stated that the move to Petrohrad would lead to an easy meeting held with families and consular workers.
However, there is no guarantee that conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"They can actually be worse," he warned.
She asked for help from Dutch King Willema-Alexandra one of Faiza Oulasen's detained activists.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch called on him to discuss their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It claims that Malik has a large share in the reconstruction of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is, in part, part of the fights in neighbouring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In the hours of English literature, at least one Shakespeare’s game, the novel of the 19th century, the romantic poetry and the modern British belettry will need to be studied from 1914 onward.
The test will also include the ‘hidden text’, to give reasons for further reading;
Combined courses of English literature and language will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will be required to have a language exam and will be invited to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue new bases for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first items to undergo a radical change.
In other key topics, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the Office of Offqual, which oversees the graduation exams, reveals changes in the structure of the graduation exams, along with a new marking system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in summer, the Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is "a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our testing system in order to regain the trust of society", and that it is necessary to insist that the graduation test be "more demanding, more ambitious and more stringent".
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For comparison of schools in Australia, mathematics is given on average 143 hours a year and in Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no formal requirement to devote more time to mathematics, the coalition resources have stated that a comprehensive math-maturity test – together with a greater emphasis on this subject in the results charts – will probably encourage schools to provide additional training.
The curriculum will focus more on "the problems of the real world", including financial mathematics.
Ostravský primitator Kanar: Rakovinou in ČSSD is not me
Before the elections, there was a heated dispute between the two wings fighting on the inside of the island's ČSSD.
It all worked out when the Prime Minister of Ostrava Petr Kainar turned to court for the non-democratic formation of candidates.
The prosecutors, however, did not want to comment too much on this, so that the party in front of the elections would not be further damaged.
But now the votes of the will are numbered.
The management of the island of ČSSD so immediately on Monday evening called the Prime Minister of Ostrava to step out of the party, and will probably press on to find out about his function.
But Petr Kainar wants to keep fighting.
What's going on in the fights, and who's on the side of it, he described in the exclusive conversation for Daník.
How do you perceive the outcome of the elections?
ČSSD must have calculated with a much better result.
Did it hurt her in front of the elections in the media in the inner part of the dispute?
I'm going to make it clear that social democracy could have a better election outcome.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the ČSSD is now.
It's a party that has its own internal problems, it's internally sick, and people think it's all right.
They made it clear in the elections.
What are those internal ČSSD diseases?
In my opinion, the ODS has been going through some time, and similar things are now being played in social democracy.
It's like Lobby, the people who've been expecting to find their condoms at the ODS, moved to the people in the ČSSD and have an influence on them.
It then relates to the fact that police are going after the island magistrate's offices and collecting computers.
It shows that ČSSD is not only composed of people who would like the good of all others, but many of them especially think of their own good.
ČSSD is divided into two unresolved camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current battle of power between Haskovci and Sobotkovci.
But it's been getting ready for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a premonition of what is happening now in Prague.
The Haske's wing gradually occupied its position so that, after the elections, it could trigger a situation that weakens the Sobotk's wing.
A person is in politics in a situation where he has to compromise at times.
Everyone's got some internal frontier where the compromises are no longer going, and that's my case.
Originally, I didn't want to run into the studio, but when I noticed the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Lubosh Zaorálka that I would try to get to the country candidate so that I, as the Prime Minister of Ostrava, would strengthen the Sobotk's wing.
The hash wing gave it a stop.
Why are you standing on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, not Michala Haska?
Famous Sobotka is, in my opinion, a person who always talks primarily about the ČSSD programme and to some extent about visas for the party and this country.
I admit, on the other hand, I didn't hear anything like that.
Michal Hasek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower authority than the Central Executive Committee, can only begin to appeal to the Chairman of the Party.
It's a fight for power regardless of everything and against the estates.
According to me, what Michael Hasek has now done in Prague has ended his political career.
How did you realise that ČSSD's island leadership did not approve of your candidate?
The political parties are based on competition, who takes place as their members.
This competition should be based mostly on program visions and on the ability of those people to fill those visions.
Of course, there are also people who do not have the ability or the vision, but the political party is for them an elevator to the money they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people start getting ahead because they break the rules without a scratch, they break the position of the parties.
They do their own political practices, and I think the laws of the Czech Republic are being violated.
It's more important for me to be aware of this problem than to take into consideration whether a Kainar has any political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect their views.
Therefore, did you submit a preliminary action against the form of a ČSSD candidate in Moravskoslez region before the elections?
The current periodic executive committee of the ČSSD in Ostrava is convinced by the fact that organisations which fail to meet it can cancel, objectively establish a new organisation, phase out the uncomfortable members of the party.
For example, they also wanted to exclude Richard Bednářek from the representatives' club, but he filed a complaint against it and they then cancelled the resolution on his exclusion.
This shows that demanding compliance with the parties’ opinions through the courts is the last option, but at the moment that the other ways and control authorities within the ČSSD have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The strong leadership of the island's ČSSD in front of the envoy Adam Rykała is to call you from the prime minister's position.
It's a public secret that on this post, the mayor of Poruby Lumír Palyza has a warrant.
That's right, Adam Rykal and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to get me off the phone.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and then they get their power on the side.
When I went back to the past, everything that might have happened around the Baník Ostrava football club and buying the Bazaar stadium was just a pretext for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so that they could mark me as the person who gives money to where it doesn't belong.
The city then bought a property that has a strategic value for it.
So how do you see it with your suspension in the primary function?
The Committee of the Regions has already called on me and other people on Monday to consider our resignations in the ČSSD.
But I think it's like a thief screaming, "Get the thieves!"
When we look at the results of my work over the last 11 years, I do not see anyone in the island social democracy who would initiate and prosecut, sometimes against the members of the party, the creation of as many developmental things as industrial zones or the expansion of the scientific and technological park.
I'm getting uncomfortable, though.
I don't read it any other than that I'm preventing the others from going to the places they're looking for.
Are you going to fight this fight again?
Because if this republic is to function well, the political parties must also work well.
It's hard to believe that any party will be able to effectively drive a state if they can't even drive themselves.
So I don't think I'd leave the ČSSD right now, because I think that the one who causes cancer on this side is not me, but those people who try to get me angry.
Olomouc opens in the historic center of public keystore
The organizer of the Olympic Christmas Markets and Winter Bracelet Paul Sáléní stated that the preparatory work at the workshop was launched on 26 October and since mid-term it has been in operation to aggregate the production of ice.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters strong and the area will be ready for the first visitors by Friday morning.
The castle has a area of 375 square meters, the podium has taken 358 square meters.
The Brusselsians and the neighbours will also have two benches with a poncho.
"We expanded the floor area, enlarged the space before the stand, and almost the whole floor area was torn apart so that the brusslers could easily be renamed," said Burny.
The streets of Olomoce are already remembering the coming Christmas.
Last year the key to repair the Lower Square was installed right before the main entrance of the workshop at the Upper Square.
The settlement of the Lower Square was completed in the spring, so the ice area could return to its original location.
For the first time, people were able to destroy themselves right before the Soviet Council in 2009, when the key was in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the city’s Christmas markets.
Christmas markets, part of which is a rich cultural programme, will be launched month before Christmas Day in the Upper Square.

The brutal murder of seniors in Zlínska will be re-solved by the country court
The National Court dismissed the accusations of a 50-year-old Slovak and a 20-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men turned down the guilt.
They are threatened by 15 to 20 years of imprisonment or an exceptional punishment.
Speaker Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court had annulled the decision of the country and returned the matter to the hearing.
He refused to comment on the reasons given by the judge that the decision had not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the complaint, the young men had beaten a man in his house for seven and a half years.
The senior died of a heart attack.
According to her husband's complaints, they were scratching and digging all over his body, as well as a metal object, apparently a gas gun, they put three tens of wounds in his head.
A man suffered serious injury, such as fractured skull bone, stroke, or bleeding into the brain that he suffered at the site.
The young people reportedly took 3,000 crowns and jewels out of the house worth about 14 thousand crowns.
According to the Court of Justice, they were the only, in addition, only indirect evidence against the alleged footing, which the expert assessed as not fully identified within the meaning of the legal instructions.
In more than ten cases, the crime scene was similar to that of the accused, but the police began to charge them as a matter of fact and not as a criminal.
In addition, some doubts have been identified when loading them.
According to the Senate, no guilt was proven without a doubt.
The court, however, acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head found relatives who thought he must have fallen and hurt himself.
She did not notice the violent death of a prescribed rescue doctor.
After a few days, the criminals contacted the olfactory doctors, who discovered signs of violent death when drinking.
The police could no longer work with all the traces of the crime scene that relatives have cleared.
There was no DNA on the scene.
The young Slovak lived in Uherskohradišk.
He is now punishing 8.5 years, which was confirmed by the Court of Human Rights last year.
According to him, the man was a group of six young men organized, with a loathsome drop of gold on his conscience.
The Loupes took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of the senior in Slopné.
Younger of the accused of the murder of a senior resident in Uherska Garden.
In August, after 11 months, he was released from prison.
The sweat starts with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Nonojma.
On Thursday, the stadium was picked up by construction workers who would rebuild the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojm is divided into four stages to reflect the standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes the first week of the autumn line
Saxophone's big and legendary jazz scene Wayne Shorter will take place next Wednesday in the 18th anniversary of Struna's autumn festival.
Shorter will be released on November 6th in the Grand Hall of Lucerny together with his quartet in the composition of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, a spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kumžák is added to Shorter.
In shorter adjustments for the symphonic orchestra, Pegasus composition from the novel album Without A Net, as well as its older Lotus composition and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of strength, which also proves that the Prague concert on the Strunas in the autumn is starting his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the music world over sixty years ago.
The number of interpreters with whom he was working goes from Miles Davis through Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santa.
On his musical journey, he met with Czech musician Miroslav Vitoš and Viennese parent Joe Zawinul, who in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade showed the direction of a new style of fusion.
He's been dating Wayne Shorter Quartet for the last 13 years.
Asus afterparty after the festival will still be the night of Spotlight, which will take place on 9 November in the club Roxy/NoD.
Along with the charismatic singer Andrey Triany, the German audience presents the Manchester Trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz influenced by electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikiska, who brings the Profound Bass electric-jazz format inspired by dance styles.
Dams ban UEFA from publishing sentences for the judge.
Dagmar Damkova, chairman of the Czech Football Association’s decision-making committee, stopped publishing sentences for the judges.
It is prohibited by UEFA rules, which it made in the discussion for the Law Journal.
Otherwise, the FAČR would be in danger.
The lady also refused to tell the Plzna footballers where she came from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Plšna, but the other members of the commissions are odizud, for example, from Prague.
So in the event of the vote, I can lose 1:6,” said Damkov in a reaction to criticism, which broke out after Plzeň last played twice as many penalties as the other league teams.
So even though FAČR has stopped publishing sentences for the judge in recent months, Damkova assures the judges that they are wrong.
"Trust me that if the Commission finds out that the judge has made a mistake, the delegation will limit it to any hit," Damkova said.
The reason why the penalties are not being published is, according to the Damo's ban on the European Union football.
"UEFA's disclosure of such information prohibits and violates severe penalties."
"We're very suspicious and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We have published the restriction, but I have received two very important warnings that, if we do not stop this, hard sanctions will come," Damkova said.
The other countries respect the ban.
"We were really an exception," she added.
If the disclosure continued, the Commission could borrow money from UEFA for the education and development of decision-makers.
"And you are very important to us."
"Without them, we would not be able to complete the decision-making program," Damkova added.
The detention of Bartholomew relates to John and Behem: Are they behind the departure of the apostles?
The police arrested the President of Vita Bart on Thursday.
He was also detained by the head of the Anti-Corruption Police Analysis and Informatics Committee, Jan Petržílek.
The detention is related to the mission of the lobbyist Roman Januska and former Prime Minister Paul Bema (ODS).
The Czech press office confirmed a reliable source of information about the respondents with which the server came from Novinky.cz.
Followed phone calls Januška and Béma, who last March published the Young Front Journal today, in which both men address each other "Masanka" and "Kolibřík", show the influence of Januškov on the city's steps under Boem's leadership.
At that time, the Dinik stated that it was ordered by the Security Information Service (BIS) in 2007, from which two years later they fled to the ABL Security Agency.
That's where Bart owned it.
Server Novinky.cz pointed out that a detained criminal Petržílek was working ahead of his appearance to the anti-corruption police just for the BIS.
To the anti-corruption service, which subsequently dealt with the mission, Petržílek moved at the same time as they were published.
"With regard to the protection of classified information law, I can't confirm anything or say anything at all," complainant Michal Muravský of the City State Department in Prague said.
He also refused to confirm that the cause was being monitored.
The case does not want to comment on the same reason.
The new civil law is being prepared for six companies out of ten.
The coming effect of the new Civilian Act and the Commercial Corporation Act of 1 January 2014 is being intensively prepared by six companies from the tenth.
Only eight per cent of the company's representatives questioned stated that the issues associated with both key codes in their company had not been resolved at all.
This results from an investigation by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which found out the views of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the coming period of effectiveness of both key codes, at the very latest, a number of managers are beginning to know what can have a significant impact on their company’s business.
The biggest changes in private law over the last 50 years, in our view, will affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
For the sake of policy-laundering, the business sector has lived for a long time in uncertainty whether or not revolutionary changes will finally happen.
"Now, however, they only have a few weeks left to move on to new rights for their companies without any complications," commented the partners Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spačil.
Of 61 per cent of companies with intensive new lawmakers, 26 per cent stated that their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to be prepared in time.
Further 35 per cent of companies from this number are planning to take the necessary measures as soon as possible.
To this end, every fifth firm has not yet been able to re-adjust yet, yet it has a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent has no opinion and cannot assess the problem.
Only eight per cent of companies admit that the issues associated with the re-registrations have not yet been resolved.
The most important legal issue related to the new civil law is the largest number of companies involved in the conclusion of new contracts (21 per cent), following the settlement of trading conditions (16 per cent) and further changes in the property and liability for damage (up to ten per cent).
Contracts shall be one of the most important news of the whole of the re-registration, which is the unification of the amendment of the contracts only within the framework of a new civil law.
The current parallel adjustment in the civil and commercial law will disappear, resulting in a more transparent treaty law for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new adjustment will offer a lot of news with emphasis on greater freedom of association," lawyer Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukás Suddaní.
In the context of the Business Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the most important topic of the issue of increasing the responsibility of statutory authorities.
The following are the topics related to changes in the calling and duration of the valid assembly (15 per cent) and the representation of the company (14 per cent).
The new legislative amendment means strengthening the obligations and possible impacts for the statutory authorities, in particular where companies are in danger of collapse or are getting into it.
"In practice, this means that if members of representations and contractors do not deal with the care of the proper economy and do not reverse the dangerous collapse of society, they can benefit from the performance of the function up to the last two years," Spačil added.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to develop Cartier's style as a living language

Travels through the mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat almost every weekend hundreds of patients
There are not too many doctors in West Africa; only one per 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 candidates at the CNN Hrdin Prize in 2013.
In the competition for the price of CNN Hrdina in 2013 you can vote for it or for any of the top ten candidates.
The winner gets $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
All 21 years old Georges Bwelle has been watching his father fall unconscious again and again and he goes to a hospital that was not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near the capital of Cameroon Yaounde in 1981.
First, he was only treated with a broken hand, but then he developed an infection that spread into the brain, and there he developed a hematoma that affected him all his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals where he received treatment that was just available.
"It's not easy," Bwelle says.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, hurry to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients there.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Ever since Bwelle's father died in 2002, things haven't changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon for 5,000 people.
For comparison only, the situation in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if the Cameroonians could visit, many could not afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of the health care expenditure in that country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle says.
They can't enjoy their lives because of poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team did 700 free operations last year.
I became a doctor myself as a cervical surgeon at the central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded a non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas on the weekend, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 people have been helped by their group of volunteers.
Nearly every Friday he and 30 people rush into delivery, attach to the medical needs of the roofs and travel in the rough terrain to the villages that need help.
They're not always accompanied by happiness.
Suddenly the vehicles must be pushed through the river and the mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed as real heroes: host, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is indeed a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle, with its wide smile and unsolicited energy, is very willing to engage in local joy.
The next day, the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients for every repair," Bwelle says.
They're coming to the village about 60 kilometers, and they're walking.
During each of these weeks, doctors provide various medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get berths or gifted glasses or a free birth certificate – a document that requires school, but which can simply not afford many poor families.
Tonight, the team is doing a simple operation under local narcosis.
Operations are usually carried out at the building school, at the workshop or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to release the other patient.
With light from the generator, the operating room, and Bwelle's hygienic equipment, and his volunteers are working in the early morning hours.
It's exhausting, but rural musicians usually help the team not to lose their motivation.
"To stay up and continue to work, they play drums all night," Bwelle says.
The team will head back to town on Sunday, tired, but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, carried out 700 free operations last year and realized that their assistance could mean a lot to locals.
One man said he'd be able to work again after surgery.
"That will change our family's future," said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working surgery at Bwelle hospital, it also works at night for private health clinics around Yaounde.
It says that this second job is financed by around 60% of its non-profit activities; the rest are covered by private contributions.
“I’m not sure when she actually sleeps,” says Katie O’Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel’s University in Philadelphia the second year and working as a volunteer for Bwelle’s group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to get money for the organization so he can do these campaigns.
For medical and medical students, such as O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, this is a great practice that they would not get home.
"We washed our hands thoroughly and removed the blood clots or held his tools," O'Malley says.
You'll never live as a medical student in America in the second year.
Voluntary students usually pay their way to Cameroon alone and often arrive with donated medical needs.
As soon as they get to Yaounde, they get food, transportation, and study, they get Bwelle.
"No doubt it's a hero," says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the population of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle's constant fight, it's not a burden.
To help others live happier, to fulfill the promise that he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy to do this job," Bwelle says.
And I mean my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Rinse people, ease their pain – that's why I'm doing it.
Look at the ASCOVIME website and find how you can help.
Minister Holcát restored the functions of the main sister for the Czech Republic
The main sister for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 thousand.
"I strongly recommend that these functions be clearly defined and formalised so that the nurses of their representative within the structure of the Office - representatives to whom they may always address their needs," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of my sister, and I think the department of care deserves to be given due attention from the Ministry.
In carrying out this call, it is not only a high level of professionalism, but also a human approach and a personal conviction.
"I will be happy and with all the responsibilities I will try to promote the steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and beautiful sisters in our health, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us with our approach to patients to perform their calls with all the empathy and help us in the public eye to improve the image of the sister," says Alena Šmidadová.
The newly appointed Chief Sister of the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, also pointed out that she wanted to address the various aspects of the health care position and decided to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medical appointments and doctors.
"I essentially don't want to separate the appointment of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to me, each having its own competence and, together with other health workers, they form a well-established working team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that arise in the performance of the sister's call, I notice these hatreds and I intend to share in their solutions."
They include, for example, the simplification of medical and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some of the administrative tasks of the sisters are overloaded and spent on them, which could and should be better spent on patients," says Alena Šmidadová.
Another area to be addressed is the improvement of working conditions, the search for a better way to cooperate with the team and with the management of healthcare providers, the adjustment of competences and also the legal issues of employment, such as the observance of the labour law or the non-interference of their sister at the time and place.
We often hear anonymous rumors, which are not documented in a particular case because of concern about the possible situation where violations of the rules could occur.
"Where there is no plaintiff, there is no judge, and so the functions of the chief sister of the Czech Republic could in this case serve as a guarantee of the preservation of the anonymity of such complaint and the specific case to allow the competent authorities to verify," Alan Šmidadová concludes.
Mgr. Alena Šmidadová studied the High School of Health in the field of Nurse Health (absoluted in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Karlovy in Prague in the course of the course of the Academy of Education (absolved in 1992).
Since 2010 it has been acting as the Head of the Medical Division and other non-medical departments and recognition of qualifications in the Education and Science Committee of the CHRC.
During her professional career, she worked as a nurse in an internal department bed, also acting as a teacher at the High School of Health, where she was also 8 years old statutory deputy director.
From 2004 to 2009, she acted as the main sister of the Czech Prison Service.
She published several expert textbooks in the field of care and articles in the journals, devoted herself to the teaching activities in the field of care.
He's not a member of any political party.
To keep them from being hated.
The writer of Václav Kahuda returned to write after twelve years.
After years, when he read, lived, but did not write, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes the new novel Wind, darkness, presence.
The fact that it is not a closed link indicates the number of sides comparable to his most famous piece of Houstina (Peter, 2001).
For Salon Kahudu, another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl.
What moved you to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it - so I wouldn't hate it.
To see all around you the new and new clones of human foolishness, young organisms affected by blind self-esteem.
I don't even talk about us elders, face damaged by powerless petitions, interfering soul and otherwise interfering with ideologicals who are trying to sell their "product" with the expression of a small selling whore.
At the beginning of the thousand years, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my juridical friends, surprises, and hidden services.
It's over.
Sometimes I feel like my brain's burning from life on this planet.
I'd rather go for a walk and then spend the night at the lighthouse reading the books.
You're talking about the feeling of death, hate.
Was there something in the past that affected you, or are you just gonna be old like us all?
It's been a while since, about ten years.
There was no name at that time.
Well, I lived after that.
There's still a quiet guy in there.
I see another lonely cyclist, each one in his tortoise of anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I participate in the grand, thousand years of the movement of the system of life on this planet - the birth of an incomprehensible future.
The immeasurable, breathing complexity of life, when every stone is a direct legacy of our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games, when by way of experiment-omyl there is another generation of beings that in billions of interactions per second create some supernatural, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you view your writing as a continuous process, or did you start completely from scratch?
Self-talking, or better spoken dialogue, which leads to the right and left half of the brain, sometimes flows into the cold and forms in the book.
As the period of peace is covered by the silent metastases of war that may wake up one day, so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt like my life was growing in my brain, and if I don't do anything, one day I'm gonna get stuck.
It's a file of questions that has formed the brain and it lays them on layers that are stored in the darkness "under the cold of consciousness".
Neocortex, gray corrugated brain, with the question of older evolutionary powers, is about the early flight of the brain tree.
He's talking to a hearty salmon, he's asking for snakes, he's looking for an answer in the bird's flight, he's raising his eye to the clouds on the sky.
Yes, the law of the ant in me and the starry heaven over me.
Finally, the brain is asking for the world.
Relatively often you express yourself metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain retains in its billions of compounds and electrochemical bonds all memories, experiences and experiences that the person concerned has experienced.
This wood logically and emotionally exposed and growing with trees of information, registers of memory, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, has been exposed constantly to changing presences, is trying to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes trouble comes from overload.
Analogically - as if you "fall" PC, from the speech emulator program and translators from foreign languages, you would get involved first in the operating environment, such as Windows, and after a few failed restarts ended in the dark green screens of Biosa, in the basic system that manages functions and collaboration on the motherboard, between processors and operating memory, etc.
For those who haven't understood what it is about, I'm talking about a psycho-spiritual crisis.
You remember her often - why do you care about this kind of regression regularly?
Because it's a pit.
In addition to functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior, there is a perversion.
It's good to quote Nietzsche, "He'd been looking into the ruins for so long when the ruins looked at him."
It feels like a person is lost if all hopes disappear, mentally "dead" and a new quality occurs.
And why am I personally interested in that?
I'm going to say something like that.
Once a man fell into a cave and drowned, days, months, and years ran, he was still drunk and read, and the books taught him to swim, so to live.
He's become a sinker.
I hope someone will help me with a written sentence, as the Hrabal texts once helped me.
To what extent do you think of a reader, of a particular person who will read your text?
The one about whom you can't tell anything meaningful, some call it conscious, another super ego, but I think it was the best thing Arthur Rimbaud described in his friend's letter:
"I am someone else - this reader is directly involved in the word and sentence formulation process."
From an early age, he read the books of the old Czech tales, sailed in the basement of Captain Noma, running after Stinadle in the dark streets.
At the same time, after all the stories of the authors and their message, it sounds: "The sun is clear to the worlds of other Karl Hynka Machy."
What if the book's out there?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
On the back of a reflection that comes to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, maybe years later, they're accidentally contacting me on the street and thanking me for helping them with my book in some of their difficult life decisions.
Books are actually "life" or better called "worlds."
They are encoded in letters, they carry experience, the history of the regions of which language.
Whenever we can wake them up to life, we let their seeds flow into the brain.
In fact, it is, in its own way, something forbidden by God - to awaken further and further life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
This is the fact that DNA is stored in the spell - according to old demonological books, we accept magic.
After the book is published - as it is - a string of copyright readings awaits you.
I remember you used to like reading.
Are you going back to it with pleasure, or do you feel it after years?
I'd rather just report it today.
And what did I find out?
Good intelligent people live everywhere.
Their basic signs - they're inconceivable, they don't notice too much, they're friendly, you don't feel lonely with them.
I give an example - in the town of Red Kostelec there was (and I hope he still lives) one piece of book (called June), a happy friend and a good girl bull.
In one drink, he introduced to me individual articles from a series of readers of my book, Houstina.
I looked into their eyes, and then I was shown to be torn apart, a read copy of my book.
In despair, I postponed the exact scheduled tomorrow, and a short man cried.
We all stood there, we kneaded, we drank and we cried.
Then the young blonde mint didn't stand, and he jumped his head from the window to the snowflake.
It was on the ground.
We ran into the night landscape and ate a happy breed of feelingers, a sick soul of the landscapers and a handful of fallen owners - came out and walked like wolves until morning.
Each of your books is formally and substantially different from the previous ones.
Does it also pay for the wind, darkness, presence?
It's a report.
It's a story about one country over nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin, in his novel Suchodol, puts into the mouth the words of an ancient Russian baje: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a dog lying on it. It's gray.
Horror, fear, secret.
It never happened, but we all know it somehow.
Maybe we've been in hell a long time ago and we've been wasting what role we're going to play in this country.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it on the free flow of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Březina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
The vast and unmistakable, similar movement of continents on the planet, affects our desire from such depth and in such a wide range that it completely surpasses our attention - and thus, with absolute self-evidentness, we do exactly in the intensity of our programmed task.
We are rewarded with dopamine inflammation, mix of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to get married, die in the defense and acquisition of new personal territories.
Sometimes it's gonna get broken and we're gonna make a feeling.
Only then do we have the right to call people.
This is the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, stands on the ocean shore of ignorance and the holes made from the dirty cape catch the waves of the wind.
I have to write so I can be a man.
Both are retired from health care.
After the wave of criticism, President Obama resigned yesterday from his frequent repeated and ambitious promise that "if you like your health program, you can leave it."
With hundreds of thousands of notifications of statements from suppliers of the Republic, the President of the United States has been accused of fraud in recent days.
Yesterday Obama broke his original promise.
"Many people who have health insurance are able to leave them," he said in his speech in Boston.
In view of what he called a "breath in the media" about statements, Obama called upon the Americans who received this notification to search for new collateral on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more complex health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration argues that it should not be surprising that 5 per cent of the population who have purchased insurance for themselves may be forced to change the programme because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Available Care Act.
"I say this to these Americans on the balance: you deserve something better," Sebelius said in his statement to the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Available Care Act, said that the launch of the internet market was "poor" since October.
"I am disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
Sebelius, quoted yesterday as saying that he had caught up with the microphone, called out to the council sitting behind her at the Committee's yesterday's discussion, which took place after a stormy exchange of views with the Republican Billy Long, a representative of Missouri, who was concerned about whether she should be involved in Obama's care programme herself.
More than three hours during the Sebelius hearing, he repeatedly questioned why the "architect" of the Law on Available Care was not voluntarily issued by the Government of Sponsored Insurance, and did not purchase a program through HealthCare.gov, which now imposes millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you call next year?
Kellner, the owner of the PPF group, wants to buy the O2 operator.
Both companies have confirmed and according to the most diverse sources of the agency, it is already hand in hand.
The transaction notice should come even in November, probably before the start of the LTE network frequency auction, i.e. before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns KKCG group.
This was released to the LTE network auction under the Sazka Telecommunications label.
And to a general surprise, until the time of the company's taste, it didn't go through to telecommunications.
But Sazku is now leading a very experienced telecommunicator Robert Chvatal.
He started as the marketing chief of the Radiomobile (today T-Mobile), later became director of the Slovenian T-Mobile and lastly led the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Saska plays several cards at once.
She went to the auction and now she's admitting she wants to launch a virtual at Vodafone's.
And it makes sense.
If the auction succeeds, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
This would probably not be welcome under the normal circumstances of Vodafone, but according to the information provided by the Economic News, it could be part of much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone currently suffers from a competitive agreement between O2 and T-Mobile operators who will fully share their networks.
That's how the waterfront needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If this success in the trend on the LTE network (as a novelty can attract a specific spectrum), the Vodafone must not be allowed to auction, or it will not be affected by the extraction of only a limited spectrum (not sufficient frequency for all).
Vodafone can share a network with Sazko.
Vodafone will release Sazku to its 2G/3G network (respectively a newly built LTE network at 900 MHz frequency), enabling the company to start a fast network.
The link between this begins to build a load network of LTE, which will also be able to use Vodafone.
Both companies can be satisfied.
The corresponding money could then be lost by Vodafone as a provider of a fixed internet or cable TV.
And Kellner?
He would buy a Czech and Slovenian O2 (Slovenian branch is a daughter of Czech) to obtain an immediate full-time operator with still good profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big mole that's gonna wait for restructuring.
In the auction, the LTE network would have received Kellner as O2 and very likely in association with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that networks will be shared.
The auction could finally end with success, but probably not with the high amounts on which the state budget is looking.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafon, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárk.
Aneb two Czech titans' business against global revolutions.
Will Czech TV ever be broadcast without signing?
In the era of President Zeman, a legendary stage with a tombstone is not difficult to hear of complaints that collects evidence of the complaint of the castle family.
In the past, the traditional influence of Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Durdík has not been documented in such a way, but to sign under it.
Truth be told, the editors have stopped running.
The above cases, however, do not answer the question of whether some journalists are being treated like this - whether they are responding to the direct order, or whether we are not using vulgarism, the typical expression of inexhaustible empathy.
And when we expect a general ban, we can't forgive ourselves the question of whether the change in conditions on television is being pursued by others, but without the unscrupulous power interests that have not yet been given the opportunity.
The truth is, in the developed countries, those who say that attempts to intervene in the sending of politicians do not go unnoticed.
The truth is, of course, also that it does not mean that there would be no complaints to the public media.
The complainants have no doubt about their independence.
On the contrary, they criticise what they consider to be a tendency that is their own, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this stage of civilization yet, and we don't have this situation.
Perhaps, however, in a country that thinks itself to be the most corrupt in the world, black-white stories about evil policies and good journalists are more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of a situation that affects the behavior of many imperfect human beings.
JAN JANDOUREK: Cursed by this country: Presidents of the Force
It is almost a rule that in key moments the country was not the head of the state in such a way that it could fulfil its national obligations.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally younger in five years, he would have experienced the end of his presidential period and the events around Munich would have been a bit different.
We would probably not win the war, but after symbolic resistance the flight could fly abroad, difficult weapons could be destroyed, and the government could rush to London immediately and not fear labor on its legitimacy.
And most of all, he wouldn't have a nation of coconuts to this day.
Benesh was not a stateman, and he was still in the state of Munich, but for the wars he had already begun to leave the hill and in February 48 he was acting accordingly.
Being better at it, he could have gone third to exile and broke the legitimacy of the communists and their rifles.
It's too bad to talk about Hach.
They chose him by saying, "Mr. President won't be able to make a decision."
But he had to, even though the big decision with a knife on his neck at Hitler's office was probably not.
The chief of research František Moravec said in the last days in March 1939 that everything should be done so that the occupation he knew on the exact day did not go so smoothly and with such a profit.
The Senilian president and the saved government did nothing, but they didn't believe him, but they were afraid.
Gottwald's human concern allowed him to correct his flying allies, as Moscow had ordered him.
Human Freedom was definitely unable to share in normalization and had to sit him, already quite old.
That Husák was a powerless and sick depressing old man of November 89, but that's the only money.
Havel was lucky he hasn't been in the office in the last few years, was saved by the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis student, but many of his senses suggest that the thinking processes are no longer what they used to be.
And now we have this.
The head of the state and chief commander of the armed forces seem to be, and we don't know everything yet.
Luckily, now there is no danger of the Republic's external threat.
Or maybe it's a threat, it's just not the way to see it.
Then the question is whether it is exceptionally ( historically) good that the President is not fully in power.
But it's not normal.
Can't we elect a president in this country once again to be acceptable to someone who is mentally and socially healthy?
Remote planets, black-and-white movies, or a little fantasy about extraterrestrial life on earth are not the subject that American jazz saxophoneist Wayne Shorter would be able to do.
In the concept of his quartet, which, on November 6th, in the great hall of Prague Lucerny, ends this year's annual festival of Struna in the autumn, which is all related to everything.
The score of the quartet of jazz saxophoneist Wayne Shorter are the instant feelings of musicians.
According to his job, they have two generations younger colleagues playing what they're just experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber affairs and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, however, is a freshly eighty-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, a nine-year-old Grammy carrier, a former partner of Milese Davis, and today's even the largest living jazz saxophoneist - does not like to explain.
He doesn't talk too much about music, even though his overall view of life is closely related to music.
In my 80 ’ s, I came to the conclusion that it is best to let your life be a surprise.
" Too many people plan everything and then they're disappointed when things turn out differently," says Shorter.
How Muslims from Thailand raised the markets of the Paris bar
You may get sick over the body, but you don't know that you're dreaming about half a kilo of it every year.
For example, he's bummed in his mouth.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trendy: it is ecological, nutritious and you have also been taken care of for a unique experience.
The offer of the house was arranged as the first in Paris on the food list of his company at the beginning of October Elie Daviron, cook and owner of the bar Le Festin Nu.
Bar, for whose name was William Burroughs' inspirational book Nahy lunch, you would find in the fashion 18 district near Montmartr a visited tourist.
With fresh avocados, cooked with red peppers, apricots, and raspberry eggs, guests can re-taste not only different larvae, mushrooms or water bunnies, but also four.
Carefully and specially packaged supplies (not to damage the body wings, toss your legs or eyes) send Daviron to Thailand.
Europe is only learning how to eat insects, where it's common.
The owner of the Paris bar with the pre-accession menu gives just a few reasons why to consume the house.
The first of these is an ecological benefit because the production of wet is much less costly for our planet (which concerns finance, space and water consumption) than for traditional mass.
"In addition, the moisture is an excellent source of proteins and the omega of 3 fatty acids," said Daviron for the station Reuters.
At the same time, a young chef does not stop his profession, simply betting on the goal of offering his customers a unique cooking experience.
According to him, he makes the right restaurant of pleasure, a sense of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just channeling new experience," he explained.
Not everyone else would think that it is a good idea to consume the scent of the perfumed pear, but the response of the Paris bar customers to the served wet is very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics will eventually taste, even if they start with the smallest layers and finally choose the scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President Václav Matyás in the Czech Republic: New green savings should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of orders and is not interested in dealing with the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings Programme was a positive signal for our construction, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after implementing the measures, will support significant amounts of heating, but also opportunities for construction companies and manufacturers of construction materials.
Every billion invested will bring more than 2,700 newly created jobs to the state.
From the point of view of the State's fiscal policy, there are significant package and multiplier effects, as well as one of the most important growth measures.
Therefore, the association of the undertakings in the construction of the Czech Republic does not, in principle, agree with the Government's resolution and requests that such steps be taken to allow further continuation of the programme so that further calls can be made within its framework.
LAW, 1 November 2013
The dog has a knife, the president has a hole in it, and he's done with the barrels.
President Milos Zeman left the motel hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the castle in Lánech.
What medical condition is he in?
In his unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that the American espionage "went too far"
John Kerry pointed out that the U.S. defence situation had changed with regard to his monitoring programmes and, in unprecedented recognition, he said that in some cases the espionage had " gone too far".
The foreign minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as a "autopilot" in view of the gross disclosure of the spy activities of the NSA, which was discovered by informant Edward Snowden.
Public information has triggered a diplomatic storm between the US government and its allies.
Mr Kerry, through video-connection to an open government conference in London, said: "There is no doubt that the president and I and the others in the government have really learned about some things that are being done out of neutrality, because this was the possibility, with reference to the second world war, the difficult period of cold war and then, of course, 11 September."
So he became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that the American espionage had crossed the line, but stressed that it had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases it went too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and explain it to people, and he is now conducting a thorough review so that no one will feel that it has happened to abuse.
I assure you that this process does not prevent the abuse of the rights of innocent people.
Mr Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA is doing well and that its monitoring operations have saved many lives.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to fire themselves.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill and throw people into the wind and attack governments.
And what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented airplanes from falling off, from breaking down buildings, and from being repaired because we can already learn about these plans ahead.
The vice-president of the Senate for European Affairs said Thursday that US legislators are going to Europe to respond to the concerns of foreigners who are concerned with alleged American espionage and convinced Europeans that they must continue to join their forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that this week he spoke to members of the European Parliament and other persons and that they were worried about their threats that he would stop participating in counter-terrorism organisations because they were disappointed in monitoring the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the national and security interests of the United States, it is really important for Europe to remain on one ship with us, given the joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, he said in the discussion with Washington Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and the chairman of the Senate's Sub-Committee on Foreign Relations on European Affairs.
And I am heading towards Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work in cooperation with terrorism, regardless of their attitude towards the NSA programmes.
The reports in the media that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe have disrupted relations with some American allies, although the chief of agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected misunderstandings of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States,
Another revelation quoted Snowden as saying that the NSA was monitoring the mobile phone of the German office of Angely Merkel and other up to 34 world leaders.
The director of the National Intelligence James Clapper defended the union's espionage as necessary and said that it was one of the two sides on the regular issue.
In the middle of the call, Murphy said his office is planning a parliamentary trip that should be carried out this year and hopes that members of both sides and chambers will appear in the delegation.
The names of the other legislators to be published in the following days.
He said he's still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the purpose of the journey was to help repair relationships, he added that they would also be prepared “a well-defined educational measure”.
He said that the European leader must be honest with his own people with regard to espionage programs that they use for years.
"While we are adjusting our monitoring programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to realize that we are not the only ones who carry out the espionage here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is heading as planned this weekend to the Middle East and to Poland to respond to the indemnity already called for an American strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran and also an American monitoring activity.
Australia turned against Thai prison stay
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to a 15-day prison on Phuket Island when she said she wasn't really attacked by a taxi driver, she turned against the verdict and was released for bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially accused by the Land Court on the Phuket Island of guilty when the Thai police said that a taxi driver along with two other men who had previously detained her was attacked in the early hours of Sunday, June 10.
However, the record from industrial television later revealed that after she broke up with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The PD on Phuket had a two-day conversation with Bamford before she found out that she had an accident.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in the correctional facility with a low alert on Phuket's periphery instead of being placed in prison for adult women.
He is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who, in the case of his daughter, asked for help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had "extreme concerns" about her daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
“It’s obviously a difficult period, but we hope to get back to us as soon as possible in safety,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed against the verdict and was released on bail of 50,000 bakhts.
The reports from Australia indicate that in the meantime, she spent her vacation in the recreational area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The legal source in Thailand claims that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was given a warning that the appeal could lead to a trial that her sentence would increase and lead to imprisonment for adults.
However, after the recent murder of the Australian employee, travel officer Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand can also try to correct the shameful image for tourists, which could have just been the liberating verdict.
The jagr joked: goal from the breeches?
In the defense band, he got a punch, and no one ever caught him.
In addition, the escape changed after a quick advance call.
Jaromír Jagr thus scored against Tampea on Wednesday night, Thursday night then the 119th winning goal in NHL commented on the social network Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent Peter Svobodov called on the director of the Czech Dragons and asked him if I should be interested in making a commercial on their most modern train in Pendolino!" he wrote on the introduction with the cover of Jagr.
I think we're kind of much alike.
I guess I'm gonna have to finish the night training so I don't get any faster.
"I'm afraid then the Minister of Defence could call and would like to make an ad on a tricycle!" he added the smiles.
In addition, New Jersey has won a second round.
"And above all, you've noticed that Maria Rottrov's treatment is taking away," Jagr concluded.
Place of approval of the light bulb
The fair elections were more than the winners brought a bunch of losers.
These are not only the parties that did not even get into the Embassy's library (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the ČSSD because of their internal breakdown.
The politicians, instead of the Christmas candles, served us on the weekend of the election gullah.
The leaping of the elections was the move of Andrej Babis, who promised the voters to change the political style of the ruling today.
The dissipation of the election result and the division on the winning side are recorded by the political (z) for Mr Milos Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters who the President Zeman publicly supported, or did not vote in the House of Representatives.
Although the President has lost strategic focus on other policies because of the unpleasant event, he still has a number of ways to get it back - for example by selecting the future prime minister.
While ČSSD is taking the chance to get a premium chair in my eyes away, entrepreneurs are approaching Andrey Babish.
The development of the permit is far away from the rapid and smooth creation of a stable government, but in comparison with the pre-election scenario of the ČSSD-supported communists, this development for the business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy is only a better report.
Due to the strong resistance of the UN to join the ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of the ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL coalition (a total of 111 Members).
In view of the breakdown in the ČSSD, which has thus become a readmission and a weak partner in the negotiation, the result of the coalition negotiations may be enough for ČSSD.
The ČSSD Minority Government is probably not going through with "non-humans" in the City.
In addition, any government to which ČSSD will be involved will be threatened by the unsatisfying ambitions of many Social Democrats who can lead sooner or later to further disbanding on the side.
So I'm asking myself, "Can't we make a self-satisfaction to other early elections?"
The next election would be a referendum on the force of the will mandate of the UN movement.
The ČSSD plans for the introduction of sectoral taxes, the greater increase in income tax or the construction of the State Bank, we hope under the table.
The ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Uzvij agree, for example, on the support of the company, on the strict fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), on the support of the employment of disadvantaged people, on the reduction of the VAT rate in the selected product.
Third areas are most likely to exist in terms of social policy and state size.
But now the ANO has a proposal, so so the program is the most likely of the ANO coalitions, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would be more inclined to transport.
Finally, what I see is a better result than a left-wing program with taxes on everything that is still moving in the economy.
