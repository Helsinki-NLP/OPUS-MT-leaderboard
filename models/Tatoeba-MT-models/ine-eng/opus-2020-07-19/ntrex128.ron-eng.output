The members of the National Gali Country Assembly are concerned about the fact that they may feel that they are "marionettes"
Several members of the National Gale Country Assembly are concurred because they have been suggested to change their title, respectively to be called MWP (members of the Gale Country Parliament).
This problem has been caused by plans to change the name of the Galician Parliament.
The members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political stage are afraid that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party of the National Assembly of Wales is concerned that he "remains with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside the Galician Country: "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "fecal matter".
A member of the Gali Party of the National Gali Party of the Gali Party said that, together, the group "is not pleased" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said that the group had an "open" attitude towards the change of name, but that it noted that "MWP" is similar to "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in the Galician State as the letter "u" in the English language spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on how to appoint members of the Assembly will certainly depend on those members."
The Law of 2017 on the Government of the Galician Country gave the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which led to the idea that many of them wish to use the "Parliament of the Galician Country".
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly of the Gali Country, the Commission preferred "members of Parliament of the Gali Country" or "WMP", but the "MWP" option received the most votes in the public consultation.
It seems that the members of the National Assembly of Wales suggested alternative options, but attempting to reach a consensus could give Elin Jones, the chairman of the Steering Committee, the draft law on amendments in a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the decalibration of members and the structure of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly will have the last word on their title when the law is being debated.
Macedonians vote for the referendum on the change of country name
This Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their opinion on changing their country's name to the "North Macedonian Republic".
The popular vote was organised to resolve an old dispute with Greece, the neighboring country, which has its own province, Macedonia.
The government in Athens has been insisting for a long time that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim about its territory and repeatedly opposed Macedonia's EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a fierce opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not take this vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is just a compromise that will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bishop's chapel stopped beating as a result of the problems that the churches in Harlem face.
"Historically, the veterans of the place I was talking to told me that before, you found a bar and a church on every corner of the street," Adams said.
"Today, there are no bars or churches."
He also said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing otherwise today," he said.
"Bars no longer have the role of living room for the entire neighborhood, where people usually hang out."
And with regard to the churches, it is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will be spent faster than the leaders expected and that, " sooner or later, the tithe will be the same".
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums filled with people who would not support the rest of the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "so this will accelerate the closing of churches, as it is unlikely that many of the people moving into these condominiums will become members of those churches."
Both churches were built by white - colored congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of African - American people – St. Martin’s Metropolitan Community in 1870, after a decade.
The original Methodist Congregation, formed of white people, moved from that area after 1930.
A congregation of African - American people, who carried out religious activities nearby, took over the building.
Church of St. Martin was taken over by an African-American congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted traders from 125th Street, a main street for the Harlem buyers, who opposed the engagement or promotion of African-American people.
A fire that took place in 1939 affected the building very much, but the proud parents Johnson made plans to rebuild it and included the carilon in it.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's church, named the charilon "the clopotes of poor people".
The expert who put the carilon into operation in July described it differently: "a cultural trade" and "an unplaced historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, further stated that it was the first carilon in the world to be performed by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who passed on to a larger carilon, to the Riverside church, 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
What St. Martin heard in the last few months was a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some brought by church deacons, others by the episcopal diocese.
The priesthood, the government of the parish, formed of deacons, wrote diocese in July to complain that the diocese "will seek to pass the costs" to the priesthood, even though it was not involved in the engagement of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the enormists complained about the lack of transparency that proved the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old child trying to catch lobsters in California
According to the authorities, on Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old child while this swim trying to catch lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said for the post KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming for about half an hour, with his friends, on the morning of Saturday, when he heard a boy screaming for help and then moved along with a group that helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel said that, initially, he thought the boy was glad he caught a lobster, but then he realized that the scream "He bit me!
He bit me!"
The whole key was broken, Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I screamed at all those who were in the water and told them to get out of the water: "It's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken with the helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
Salvamar, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks ago, but concluded that it is not a species of shark that is a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma at the top of the trunk.
The authorities have restricted access from the Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and security reasons .
Giles also mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in that area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury Retailer plans to strengthen its position on the market for beauty products and fashion in the UK
Sainsbury preia Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams, making available districts with beauty products in the style of a universal store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a position-building in the UK’s beauty products market, worth 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow, although domestic and fashion products sales are not in measure, the larger beauty products regions will be tested in 11 country stores and will be integrated into more shops next year if they prove to be successful.
The investment in the beauty industry comes in the context of which supermarkets are looking for a way to use the previous space for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Representatives of the retailer Sainsbury said the number of beauty products he offers will be doubled, reaching up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket also relaunchs its range of makeup products, Boutique, which means that most products are intended for vegan people, a demand that is increasingly met among young buyers.
In addition, the products of the French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two stores of the Sainsbury chain for testing, the first being the open one last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online purchases and the tendency to buy smaller quantities of food every day from the nearest food store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of the Sainsbury retailer, said that the outlets will increasingly appear as universal stores, because supermarket chains are trying to cope with the fight against large retail stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has included both Argos' outlet products in hundreds of stores as well as Habitats, since it purchased both chains two years ago, which means it recorded increases in food sales, as well as increased profit.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to resupply its pharmaceutical and beauty product compartments failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but the negotiations ended after a divergence about how to share the revenues of Boots stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was conceived after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business including 281 stores, Celesio company, which holds Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds, three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four magazines.
Paul Mills-Hicks, retailer commercial director Sainsbury, said: “I have transformed the aspect of our beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specialized training of our colleagues, who will be available to offer you advice.
Our range of brands can be adapted to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations turn us into an extraordinary location to buy beauty products, revolutionizing the old way to make purchases."
Peter Jones is angry after Holly Willoughby retired from a contract of 11 million pounds sterling
The protagonist of the "Dragons' Den" TV show, Peter Jones, is angry after the presentation of the TV Holly Willoughby retired from a contract worth 11 million pounds with his life-style company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time to get involved in their project regarding the True brand, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple's company was compared to the Goop brand, owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presentation of the “This Morning” show, 37 years old, announced to Instagram that it would withdraw.
Holly Willoughby generated Peter Jones's anger, the leading player of the Dragons' Den show, in the last moment of their business, offering life-style services to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources, Jones became angry when one of the most beloved people on television admitted Tuesday, during a sitting stressed at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, no longer allow her to dedicate their brands, True, which includes accessories and household items.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and almost doubled Willoughby's property, with estimated value of 11 million pounds.
After Willoughby, 37 years old, announced Instagram that he would give up the contract for True, Jones left Britain to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
A source statement: “Truly was one of Holly’s priorities far away.
She had to be her future in the long run for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw shocked everyone.
No one came to believe what happened on Tuesday, it was less until the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow's headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the present issue "This Morning", which is one of the best sold out in the UK, could cause the company millions of damage, as a result of investments in products such as feathers and candles, clothing and household items, as well as possible additional delay in launching.
It can also represent the end of a long - term friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, are ten-year-old friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby put the Truly brand bases together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company's shares.
Willoughby will become the Ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the "I'm A Celebrity" show from the ITV.
A close source of Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business. ”
I was very hard, and then "I fell in love"
He made jokes about the criticisms he will receive from journalists because he made a comment that some would consider him to be "indemnified by a president" and that he had such a positive attitude with regard to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
Trump said by imitating a voice of "presentator of news " .
"I didn't take a step back."
He said Kim was interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a huge step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearisation have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders from around the world on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not observe a "responsibility" from the United States regarding the previous North Korea disarmament actions.
On the other hand, it noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on it.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
"All goes well with North Korea," he said.
"We wish to go to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He also said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had positive results: stopping rocket tests, supporting the release of hostages and returning US troops.
He also defended himself unusually to talk about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act like a president, but if I were to act like this, instead of the 10,000 people outside, who are trying to enter this invincible arena, it would be around 200 people," Trump said, showing the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, causing hundreds of deaths
According to the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations have been told that their assistance is not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of the island of Lombok has been displaced, a national disaster has not been declared, a condition necessary for the launch of international aid actions.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear about not asking for international assistance, so it is a rather difficult situation," Sumbung said.
Although the "Save Children" Foundation is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel are allowed to access the site.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that the authorities in Indonesia evaluate the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to the relief efforts.
In view of Indonesia’s ongoing disasters, it is unlikely that the country will continue to be sufficiently prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although shelters for tsunamis have been built in Aceh, they are not very often met on other coasts.
It seems that the lack of a warning siren in the case of tsunamis in Palu, although a warning was issued in this sense, could have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of circumstances, the journey between the islands of Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters make this more complicated.
A hospital stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place where the new disaster occurred.
President Joko Widodo proposed improving the pre-industry infrastructure in Indonesia to be the central point of his election campaign and strongly allocate money for roads and railways.
But lack of funds has affected Joko's administration, which will take part in a new election campaign next year.
Yoko also faces persistent pressures from the Indonesian sectarians, as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes, as the gangs of Christians and Muslims settled on the streets, using swords, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool gives the saving goal and equals the score in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of the Chelsea team, with a goal in 89 minutes on Saturday, at the Stamford Bridge football stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, while it is about 30 meters from the side of the side team, and his team was led by Chelsea with 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before giving a shot in the direction of the gate.
The ball came up above the one, heading towards the corner on the right top of the gate.
Finally, the ball passed through Kepa Arrizabalaga which jumped to her and fell into the gate.
"I should just try to get in the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get ahead as much as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn't think much about it, just, I took the ball away."
Chelsea drove 1-0 on a break after Belgian star Eden Hazard marked in 25 minutes.
The blue team's attack sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, and then returned to the middle of the ground and ran to half of the Liverpool team's ground.
Kovacic made a quick move of one-two in the middle of the ground.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who came in.
Hazard crossed the defense and sent the ball into place, able to hit it with his left foot and cross the player Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
Liverpool will have a match against the Naples team in the League of Champions leagues at 15:00 on the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against the videoton team at UEFA Europa League Thursday at 15:00 in London.

Several people have been trapped under the ruins of ruined buildings with a magnitude of 7.5 that took place on Friday and that triggered waves up to 6 meters, said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000, was covered by the remains caused by the collapse of buildings.

Cromwell's Parliament statue becomes the most recent commemorative monument affected by the altercations on "rewriting history"
Its removal would be a poetic justice for the destruction in the Taliban of so many cultural and religious artifacts of England, carried out by its fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "a fool" and "an attempt to rewriting history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Society, said: “It was inevitable in the debate on the removal of the statues as the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace to become a target.
The iconoclass of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe a wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for his uncle Thomas' actions in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent representation, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the 19th century's opinion and part of the story of a figure that many think deserves to celebrate.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is an exact representation, this is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
But certainly, the conflict since the middle of the 17th century has led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure, which is part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve celebrated and celebrated."
A pig caused the death of a farmer from China
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local press agencies.
The man, identified only after the name of the family ‘Yuan’, was found dead after he had been segregated an artery and was covered with blood, near a pig farm located on the market in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, the Sunday editor of the Morning Post in South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs' vaccines to a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Looks like he came with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby cottage was open.
He said there's a pig in the cottage, a male of large blood sizes in his mouth.
Legal doctors confirmed that a pig of about 300 kg caused the death of the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were full of blood and flesh," said the cousin, whose family name is "Wu", for Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed their pigs.
After about an hour, his body was found.
The animal that caused man's death did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative said to Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent him from attacking someone else, while the police took evidence from the crime scene.
The Yuan family and authorities seem to negotiate compensation for its death.
Although they are rare, cases of pigs have been reported that have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, as a result of a 300 kg pig, a man in the Gali Country was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but blood taste can trigger such reactions."
‘It’s just playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to respect them properly," he said.
Hurricane Rosa, which has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rains in the south-west of the United States
As recommended, Hurricane Rosa loses its intensity as it moves to the freshest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain that will cause floods in northern Mexico and in the south-west of the United States in the next days.
Rosa records wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a Category 1 hurricane Sunday from 5 a.m. and was located approximately 600 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depressing area across the Pacific Ocean began to be formed and moved east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula, months, in the form of a tropical storm, will begin to push intense tropical humidity north-west of the United States.
Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity that will interact with the depression zone will generate abundant rain in the southwest in the following days.
Local, precipitations between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous fast floods, waste streams and possibly land wells in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in some parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation is expected between 5 and 10 cm in the south-west, especially in the majority of Arizona.
Rapid floods may occur due to rapid deterioration due to the nature of the tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert below, given the threat of tropical rain.
Strong rain may cause the canioans to turn into violent rivers, and storms will bring local winds to the reefs and dust.
The depressing zone approaching will bring torrential rain to the areas on the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of about 2 cm is possible, which could lead to minor flows of aluncoast waste and roads.
These will be the first precipitations in the region in the wet season.
Scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on the second part of the Sunday and on the first part of the month, before the rain spreads more months night and Tuesday.
The intense precipitations will spread in the so-called "four corners" on Tuesday and will persist until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes will occur in the US, as the Arctic region will get colder, but the tropicals remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature at short distances.
On Sunday, dramatic temperature differences are encountered at the U.S. central area level.
There is a temperature difference of about 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the extended heat of summer will try to form and expand again.
It is proposed that a large part of the central and eastern US will be faced with a warm beginning of October, with temperatures up to 27 degrees in the extended areas, from the south to certain portions of the north-east.
Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, with about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high chances of temperatures above average for the US east until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have followed Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people have followed the press statement supported by the candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that is supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, TV stations interrupting the normal Friday program for a news of the last hour: an agreement between Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona to conduct an investigation by the FBI for a week.
Ford told the jury that it is 100% sure that Kavanaugh had her pregnant while she was in a state of drunkenness and that he tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, as part of an intense witness, said it's 100% sure this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have been followed up on Friday's hearing.
The company counted the average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available immediately for other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's usually having trouble contorting people who see from the office.
To put this into perspective, this audience is similar to that for a football game in play-off or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's name, it was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the daily hearing.
The ABC was in second place, with a total of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was tracked by 3.1 million people, NBC of 2.94 million, MSNBC of 2.89 million, and CNN of 2.52 million.
The interest remained at a high level after hearing.
Flake was in the center of Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by the CNN and CBS Chambers Friday morning while the protestors shouted at him and he was trying to get on a lift to a sitting of the Judicial Committee.
He was looking down for a few minutes while people were arguing about it, and everything was broadcast directly to CNN.
"I'm right here, in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling us the truth?
It was said to her, "O power, while so many women are unable."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator, that he would have more to say at the committee's meeting.
Televisions later broadcast the vote directly within the Judicial Committee to advance the nomination of Kavanaugh for the Senate's vote.
But Flake said he'd only do this if the FBI agreed to analyze the charges against the nominee next week, a matter called for by minority democracies.
Flake was largely convinced of talks with his friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators after that.
Flake's election was an important one, and it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes necessary to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Accuses Critics of "political Games" About Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with the future of Britain and submining national interests in an interview for Sunday Times.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of Britain, participated in the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to his photo on the first page of the paper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on his plan for Brexit, so-called Plan Chequers, saying that the proposal that the UK and the European Union collect each other's tariffs was "fullly ridiculous".
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of shooting the LSU player mortally
Police arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player, at the age of 20.
Ditheon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and imprisoned, being charged with murder of grade 2, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
The authorities published the filming of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during his stay.
The police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, affiliated CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police say he recognized the fact that he shot Wayde dead.
His claim was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Legal Medical Office Baton Rouge published a preliminary report Friday, saying that death was caused by a gunshot through the neck.
The Department deserves the Louisiana police force, the state police lab, the South University police and the citizens of the area, for the aid offered in the investigation, which led to the arrest in question.
Athletic director LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for "dignifying and seeking justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The attack at a height of 1.98 m grew in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball for LSU.
The last season, marked, on average, 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoverys.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "destroyed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This thing worries me all the time," Wade said.
A volcano threw a column of ashes over the city of Mexico City
The ashes from the Volcano Popocatepetl arrived in the southern areas of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to keep the distance from the volcano after the event was launched in the crater and 183 gas and ashes were recorded over 24 hours.
The centre monitors several hurricanes and vibrations.
The images on the socialization networks presented thin layers of ashes on the car parks in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians observed an increase in volcanic activity at 72 km south-east of the capital after an earthquake of 7.1 shielded Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Falling between the Catalan police and separatists before the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the pro-independence protestors met with Jandarmi, at the first anniversary of the vote for the secession of Catalonia, forcing thousands of opposition demonstrators.
A group of masked pro-separatists kept far away from Jandarmi bombed these eggs and dusty waxes, creating clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The warming got worse later, the police using their batons to control the situation.
For a few hours, pro-independence groups shouted "Don't forget, we don't forgive," while Union Protestants shouted "Living Spain!".
14 people received medical attention for minor injuries caused during protests, according to local press.
The tensions remain at a high level in the region that wants to become independent one year after the referendum of 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose, in a comprehensive majority, to become independent, although participation in the vote was low, and those against the secession boycotted, in large part, the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote at the polling stations in the region, with violent riots taking place.
Pro-independence groups camped over Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protestors were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of gaining independence from Catalonia.
"Last year I lived some of the most beautiful moments of my life.
I looked at my parents crying for joy that I can vote, but now we don't have anything to do," he said.
Despite gaining a vital victory, but narrowly, in the regional elections in December last year, the pro-independent Catalan parties have tried to maintain their progress this year, many of the most well-known leaders being either in exile or in detention, awaiting the trial for the role played by the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, said that politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
"The situation is becoming increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, announced that he would run for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for European elections, it is the best way to denounce the return to democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: More men were arrested after entering a car into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car entered a Londonderry house several times.
The incident took place on Thursday, about 7:30 p.m., in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said they were damaged at the port level and even the building.
Looks like at some point, he used a gun against the car.
Menga's hit helped the Livingston team win 1-0 in front of the Rangers team
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston assured victory
Livingston left the Rangers team without a replica, Steven Gerrard reaching the second defeat in 18 matches, as the manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to make the difference while Gary Holt's team played at the same level as Hibernate in the second replay.
Gerrard's team remains without a victory in the Premier League this season and faces the Hearts leaders, being behind them with eight points, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers hosts Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues unbeatable in the division up to six matches, Holt's main coach still feels the taste of defeat, as he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses the chance against the crown visitors
Holt's team should've prepped a long time before writing down, and their guidance caused all sorts of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to cross and tried to suck on the port space, then Alan Lithgow managed to suck long after he entered by swinging to intercept the ball sent with Craig Halkett's head.
The guests were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could make trouble to the visitors at the free hits.
And that was how the crucial goal came.
Rangers accepted a free shot, and Livingston succeeded in opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson working together to take care of Menga, who searched and marked out the center.
At that stage, Rangers dominated the possession, but he faced the master's impenetrable defense, and porter Liam Kelly was no longer deeply disturbed in the rest of the game.
This game model continued in the second replay, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman didn't make it against Allan McGregor from Rangers, and Lithgov gave a long shot from another player of the Livingston team.
The diagonal steps continued to come into which the Livingston team, but unsuccessfully, and the two demands of penalty - after Halkett blew Glenn Middleton and after a hen - were not accepted.
"Penomenal game" offered by Livingstone – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingstone.
They were excellent, except, continuing to exceed expectations on a ascending path.
Their style of game and team have never changed since returning to the top, but the merit must be given to Holt for how he trained the team since he took it.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga made it difficult for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the party.
But the Rangers weren't too inspired.
Although they've had good performance since they were led by Gerrard, they haven't reached the same standards.
The empty steps were unsuccessful, they succeeded once to capture the port of free opponents, and this should be an alarm signal for Rangers, which is in the middle of the classification.
Joint reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
It was all pink on Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin to have breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to remedy relations between NATO alliances.
They are not satisfied because of problems such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world outside Turkey.
The police have called for security reasons to prevent a large number of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but enough supporters have gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan, the majority of Kursi, heard their voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive him with open arms in the country.
The contradiction protests reflect the division of a visitor considered a hero of some of the Turks in Germany and an autocrat of others.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker dies after collision with a car
A biker died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place at the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The car driver stopped, and the paramedics appeared at the site of the accident, but the man died at the scene.
The accident took place only a few months after another biker died following an accident that took place on Childers Street, where the driver fled from the spot, which is about a mile from where the accident happened on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers are trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in that area, the bus route is distorted, and motorcyclists have been recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured following a riot
Six prison officers were injured following a detention in a high-security prison for men, a prison representative said.
Sunday, a race to the HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire was launched at around 9:30, being underway.
Specialized officers have been brought to take care of the detention, in which eight detainees are involved, isolated in an arapeutic.
Officers were treated on the spot for minor injuries on the face.
A spokesperson for the prison said: “The assistance of the prison’s specialized personnel was requested to deal with an incident at the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical attention after being injured.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules about those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer period of time after grace."
In the HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 detainees, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, officials dealing with disturbances were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, the staff being attacked with billiards.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are at risk of being flooded because of the Rosa hurricane (dry areas can enjoy the benefits as a result of this)
There is rarely a tropical depression in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen at the beginning of next week, because the remaining energy resources of the Rosa hurricane will be used in the south-west desert, presenting a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued quick flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the western zone of Arizona, south and east of Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will have a direct route to Phoenix on Tuesday, and on the second day of the month will cause precipitation.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix announced on Twitter that only "Ten tropical cyclones have maintained a storm or tropical depression at a distance of approximately 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an action hurricane about 60 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Centre for Uruguay provide for precipitations of between 5 and 10 cm, with quantities isolated up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west desert, including in the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, quantities between 3 and 5 cm will be recorded, with possible total quantities up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, in certain areas the torrential rain will be beneficial because the south-west is facing drought problems.
According to the United States Secet Monitor, at least 40% of Arizona is confronted with at least one severe Secet, respectively the second largest category", information that is found on weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landfills in the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who still had the power of hurricane in the morning of Sunday, with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north, 19 km per hour.
The oven will meet colder water in the Pacific and will therefore decrease.
Thus, it is expected that it will produce land dumps in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or the evening of the month.
Torrents in Mexico could be significant, presenting a risk of high floods.
"There are expected torrential rains between 8 and 10 cm" from Baja California to the north-west of Sonorei, and can also reach 25 cm", according to weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north, in Mexico, as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the morning of Tuesday, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching south of Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger represented by Rosa or her remains is the extreme torrential rain from Baja California, the north-west of Sonora and the south-west of the United States," said a representative of the National Centre for Uruguay.
These rains are expected to produce sudden floods, which will endanger people's lives, and will bring waste streams to the deserts, as well as land wells in the mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested as a result of a murder attempt after a 16-year-old was found with injuries caused by an injection into Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 04:00.
He was taken to the hospital, where he's in a stable state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area tonight, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
Officers have asked citizens who might have materials on the mobile phone to submit to the police department.
Trump said Kavanaugh faced the "unhappiness and mania" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the unmistakable and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump further stated that Kavanaugh faced the "unhappiness and mania" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Joi, Kavanaugh testified to Congress, strongly denying Christine Blasey Ford's statements about having sex with her ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified in the sitting on her statement.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best minds in the legal field of this generation," he told many supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the Republic's presence in the interim elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our life.
I'm not running, but, in a way, I'm running," he said.
"For this reason, I am expressing my overall positive opinion on the candidates I consider to be extraordinary."
Trump argued that democracies are in a mission to "resist and obstruct".
It is expected that the first procedural vote to the Senate since the nomination of Kavanaugh will take place on Friday, a GOP-led assistant for the CNN said.
Hundreds of people killed by the Indonesian earthquake, the number growing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them being taken from the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities declared Saturday.
Hundreds of people flocked to a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves with a height of six meters hit the beach at amurg, people being taken by water and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people still saw their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, becoming such a victim," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the BNPB Disaster Reduction Agency, said at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami brought with it cars, bags, houses, hitting everything on the dry land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled along at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the land.
It added that some people were forced to climb trees to escape tsunamis and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centres in Palu.
The photographs published by the disaster agency present several destroyed buildings and warehouses, torn and broken bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the replicas continued to stir up the coastal town.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said that the energy emitted by the strong winter earthquake was about 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb from Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical structure of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow golf course, probably intensified the volume of the tsunami, added this representative.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of broken buildings, he said, in addition to the 540 injured and 29 missing persons.
Nugroho said that victims and pests could be larger along the coast of 300 km north of Palu, a zone called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were "completely disturbed, without any information" in Dongala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
He added: "This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticised because it did not inform about the fact that a tsunami would hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In posts on socialization networks, you can hear a man at the top of a building calling for brake warning that the tsunami is approaching people on the adjacent street.
In a few minutes, a wall of water hits the ground, taking this building and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major interruption of electricity, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate the rescue efforts of the authorities.
The Army began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuated people still need food and other basics.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu for Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800 people.
The situation is extremely serious.
While Word Vision staff from Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are placed in improvised shelters in the office's court, they passed the devastating scene, said Doseba.
She added: “They told me they saw many ruined houses.”
The situation is very serious.
Even though the aid groups began to remain in the event of disaster, some people complained that foreign workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to the regulations in Indonesia, financial resources, supplies of materials and personnel can only reach the place of production of a disaster if declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"When the government says, 'Yes, this is a national disaster,' we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has been announced yet."
After the second night of the earthquake and the tsunami of Fridays in Palu, the friends and families of the disappeared hoped that loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
Saturday, a boy was pulled out of a channel.
Sunday, the rescue staff released a woman who was in ruins for two days, with her mother's body next to this one.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the national paragliding team, trained for the Asian Games, which ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paragliding pilots.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandadi, were his students.
"In view of the experience in paragliding activity, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, a few hours after spreading news about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the community of parapanta sports practitioners, he sent desperate messages to whatsApp competitors in Palu who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But in his right message, there was only one grey biffe, and not two blue biffes.
"I think that means the messages have not been transmitted," he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while feeding a banker from Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from an employee of Brink who feeds a banker in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver emptyed a ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to transport more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in a communiqué.
While he was busy, another man “run by the back of an employee of Brink” and stole a bag of money that had to be transported.
According to the report, the witnesses observed several suspects who fled the scene, but the police did not mention the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identity is asked to contact the Newport police on the phone number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his scene name to "Ye"
Rapper Kanye West changes his scene name to Ye.
It announced on Saturday about the change on Twitter: "the person officially known as Kanye West".
The West, at the age of 41, is called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of the eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before its appearance at Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to launch its new album, Yandhi.
It comes to the show instead of the Ariana Grande song, which cancelled "for emotional reasons", the producer mentioned the show.
Besides that it is an abbreviation of the current name of the scene, the West said earlier that this word has also a religious significance for it.
"I think "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West at the beginning of this year, in the discussion about the title of the album with the head of the Big Boy radio.
"Because I'm you, I'm us, it's about us.
It all started from "Kanye", which means the only one, and it reached "Ye", this being a reflection of our good, bad, nuclear and all of our things.
The album is more a reflection of what we are as people."
He's one of the most rappers who have chosen to change his scene name.
Sean Combs had countless stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
And a former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes with cream, others without, as well as with large letters.
Mexico President promises not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military forces against civilians, as soon as the country's 50th anniversary of a bloodthirsty rebate against the students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will never use the army to repression the Mexican people".
The troops led a peaceful demonstration from the market on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the left movements of students took place in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has undertaken to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and by opening several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for IA
While China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several U.S. government members made announcements about IA, even though there is no official strategy for artificial intelligence in the U.S.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it proposes to be first in terms of IA innovation by 2030.
"Dublining the IA research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far more behind the US and that we are looking for the next IA discovery," Lee said.
The duplication of funds could double the chances of the next major IA performance being done in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Superpowers IA: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Synovation Ventures, which invested in one of China's leading companies, Face +.
In 1980, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that beat American player Othello, which was the best in the field at that time, and later he was executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch in China.
Lee appreciated the previous competitions of American governments in the field of technology, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency's advanced defence research projects, and asked when it will be next, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government funds, Lee said.
"China does not put drunks in the wheels of academic leaders, but corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired outstanding graduates from universities to work at IA in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help the US intensify its IA efforts.
"I think it should be offered automatically to doctoral students in IA," he said.
The State Council of China issued a New Artificial Intelligence Generation Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to people from similar academic institutions in how the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations provide money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of the year, the Defence Department of the United States set up a Common Centre for Artificial Intelligence, with the aim of involving partners in the field and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a selection commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
This month, the US Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced an investment worth $2 billion for an initiative called "AI Next".
NSF also now invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, there have been no changes to US legislation aimed at creating a Commission for National Security in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in referendum if they want to change the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum if they wish the country's name to be changed to "the North Macedonia Republic", a change that would resolve an old dispute with Greece for a decade, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of the neighbouring country is a claim on its territory and has opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the new name proposed, but the opposition nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the slave population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycotting campaign had raised doubts about the vote, as it was possible that the minimum limit of 50% needed for the referendum to be validated could not be reached.
The question on the referendum ballot will be: "Do you agree with EU and NATO membership, accepting the agreement with Greece?".
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the destruction of Yugoslavia, in order to be acceptable to entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the country's future, so that young people in Macedonia live free under the shadow of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79-year-old in Skopje.
Although it is not legally mandatory, enough members of parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
For the name to be changed, a quorum of two-thirds is needed in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities were reported until 13:00.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of those with voting rights were put to the vote.
"I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old, a speaker from Skopje, the country's capital.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, voted for the referendum on Macedonia's change of name, allowing him to join NATO and join the European Union.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, at 54 years of age, prepared a small-sized scene and pulled a chair in front of the high courts of those who boycotted the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with their face up, not on the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not willing with the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said joining NATO will bring the necessary investments in Macedonia, which has a 20% unemployment rate.
"I think the majority will be in favour of changing the name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of joining NATO and the EU," Zaev said after expressing his vote.
He said that a result in the change of name would be "confirming our future".
According to a poll published last month by the Policy Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of citizens with the right to vote will participate in the referendum, under the number of participants required.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Among them, 70% said they would vote in favour of the change.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious strike at the level of the pro-vec government policy since the adoption of the government in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero de la Manchester City manages to go through the entire Brighton team's defense and march a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to go through the Briggton team's defense and win the Manchester City 2-0 team on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed to Aguero that it was incredibly easy to walk in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attack took a turn in the middle of the ground at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly among the three defensive players from Brighton, before reaching the free part of the ground.
Then Aguero woke up surrounded by four players of the opposing team.
He managed to get past a defender, and then he passed over several adverts on the edge of Brighton's team.
After that, he gave a hand to the left, the balloon reaching for Sterling.
The English attack sent the balloon back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, and managed to avoid the porter from Brighton, Matthew Ryan, with a shot at the right side of the gate.
"Aguero faces some problems on his feet," told reporters Pep Guardiola, the Manchester City team manager.
“I talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he wrote an empty one at the time."
But Sterling is the one who got them the initial advantage for Azuri in the game of the Premier League.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a deep passage on the Brighton team territory at that stage.
Then he gave Leroy Sane a hand on the left flank.
Sane blew the balloon a few times until he sent Sterling's passport, which sent it to the gate.
The Azuri attack hit the balloon to the square just before it went out of the field.
Manchester City will meet at 12:55 p.m. with Hoppenheim in the group phase on Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to do the ravages in the match against Rockies.
With the national team removed from the game-off competition, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday's match against the Colorado Rockies team, but only if there are still implications in the play-off for Rockies, which holds an advantage to the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies got at least an unforeseeable place, with a victory of 5-2 against the national team on Friday night, but still trying to keep their first division title.
“Even if we don’t play for nothing, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here, from Denver, along with many, and the other team would probably play at the highest level at any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in these circumstances?"
The national team has not yet announced the player that will open the game on Sunday, but according to the sources, it is intended to allow Scherzer to give the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening of the game number 34, had a heating session Thursday and would throw in normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington average has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 routings in 220 and 2/3 matches in this season.
Trump expresses his support in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation of a decision by the Supreme Court on Brett Kavanaugh as regards the importance of the Republic's presence in the interim elections.
“Our whole effort is at stake in November.
There are still five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big ones, not candidates, but actually candidates, which is why I try to support good candidates from the platform," he said.
Trump continued: “See this horrendous, radical group of democrats, see what is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any means necessary, you can see their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to scratch to get power and control, they want to have power and control, and we won't give it."
He also said that democracies are in a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"And you can see this in the last four days," he said, describing the democrats as "swallows and evils, fools and liars."
He referred to Senator Diane Feinstein of the Democratic Party and is a member of the Judicial Committee of the Senate, which was strongly hated by the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document?
Excuse me?
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute – that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labourist Party no longer tolerates people with a different view.
People who express their opinion are no longer tolerated
It didn't surprise me at all that Momentum activists in my local party supported the censorship movement as far as I was concerned.
After all, I am just one of the members of the Labourist Party in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, has received a similar treatment because it has been fierce in anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, the censorship motion represented a criticism at my address that I did not agree with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
As for the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar problems, ironically, concerning which Jeremy did not share his views with previous leaders.
The communication for the Nottingham East Friday meeting of the Labour Party mentioned that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of the eight-year period as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday night were so.
Unfortunately, today many meetings are not taking place in this way, and the promise of a "better, lighter" political environment has been forgotten for a long time if it has ever been respected.
It has become increasingly evident that the different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged according to what is accepted by the party’s management.
Things began to be so when Jeremy became the leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common vision about politics began to expect me to change my thinking and agree with some things that I had not agreed with before, including national security or the single market in the EU.
Every time I speak in the public, no matter what I say, there is a wave of abuses on the de-socialization networks that require my removal from the party, denouncing the centre policy, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person who faces this.
Actually, I know I'm happier than my colleagues, because the comments about my person tend to be political.
I am impressed by professionalism and by the determination that my colleagues have proved to be facing sexual or racist abuse, but they maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with each motion of censorship or change of selection rules, the party becomes increasingly less flexible in this regard.
Many people have recommended me in the last two years to put my head down, not to be so vocal, and everything "will be fine" like that.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labourist Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the neglect shown by the Thatcher government has led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who need them most, as local councillor or minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, including the last election.
No person in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and the issues that I disagree with regarding current leadership are null and void.
People who have supported Friday's motion can only say that, in the context of the country heading towards Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not for the Momentum group in Nottingham, but for citizens, whether or not I am a member of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and promise you that no threat of removal from the party or political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions that I consider to be of your best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Air’s football team reaches the top of the classes
Despite the fact that two late trials have influenced in some way the final outcome, there is no doubt that Air deserves to win the extremely interactive match today in Tennent's Premiership.
It's now in the top of the class, being the only team without any defeat of the ten.
Finally, everything was summarized in their better defense, as well as in the fact that they took more of the opportunities, which helped the host team and thanked coach Peter Murchie.
"We have been tested more during our games so far and we continue to be innocent, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie de la Melrose said: "The medals are given to the Air team, they took more chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave him an advantage to the Air team, but a yellow cartoon received from Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, playing at Warriors, allowed the Melrose team to change their score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an untransformed attempt.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, even in the middle of the game, managed to register, and then managed to transform an individual trial, and score was 17-5 for Ayr at break.
But Melrose started the second one very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The game was suspended for a few minutes due to Ruarid Knott's serious injury, which was pulled out of the market, and since the start of the game, Ayr has been disengaged by trying the player Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson then received a yellow cartridge and again, the Melrose team made the reserve player pay with an untransformed attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a full pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow cardboard because he liked Climo without a ball, MacPherson managed to march, offering him the advantage of Air.
Climo transformed the experiment, as he did again almost from the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe performed a box kick move and sent extreme Gregor Henry deep for the fifth attempt of the host team.
The video of the "Still Game" site appears prepared for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the “Still Game” site, appears to be ready to move into the hospitality industry after he learned that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The man, 56 years old, plays Jack Jarvis's role in BBC-loving show, writing his script and playing with his partner for a long time, comedy actor Greg Hemhill.
The two have announced that the next series, the new number, will be the last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, this is the director of the company Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, although a source from Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to be involved in the "industry in the development of restaurants".
"The sea is ours": the island of Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a shipyard full of macara in La Paz.
Public buildings build the blue flag, like the ocean.
The ship bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is our right.
We have to get it back."
Along Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, the memory of a lost coast in front of Chile in a bloody conflict of 19th-century resources is still alive – just as the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are likely to be at the highest level in the last few decades, as Bolivia expects a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary maturity, a spirit of unity and senate and, of course, awaits the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow ICJ's decision on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will give a ruling in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of firm discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to the sea, Bolivia.
Here Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who faces a controversial battle for the coming year – also has many winnings following the month's decision .
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts think it's unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that it would change too little things if it happened.
The United Nations within the Netherlands has no power to grant Chile's territory and has provided that it will not determine the outcome of the possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes only six months after final pleas have been heard indicates that this case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And not only did Bolivia not succeed because, but it's possible for the last four years to have given it back.
"The problem of access to the sea was disturbed by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' s belligerent rhetoric weakened any Chilean resident charity, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at a given time, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not changed their ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually rapid.
On Monday he will bring for Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end the 139 years of mutual advantage-disagreements," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – another one of the most beloved presidents in Latin America – used the maritime problem as a political support.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must pass through the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not take place if it cannot be trusted in the United States
Ri Yong Ho, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if he could not trust Washington.
He spoke again about this Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to respect the promises made during a summit in Singapore with rival leaders.
His comments come in the context where the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to begin diplomatic action on nuclear threat after more than three months from Singapore's meeting with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
It stated that it is an "real visa" that the United States' continued sanctions and the United States' objection to the declaration concerning the end of the Korean war to make the territory of the north ever surrender.
Washington is reluctant to agree with the statement without the Phenian taking significant steps first.
Both Kim and the president of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who don't think the Phenian has serious intentions to give up the arsenal the country considers the only way to ensure his safety.
Pompeo intends to visit the Phenian next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion presentation from Paris presents the latest trends with regard to decks and will be available in stores soon
If you are looking for hats to extend your collection or to protect you completely from the sun, you no longer need to search.
The fashion creators Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants at the Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagance hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
The very practical appearances won the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion makers sent the creations that steal eyes on the podium.
The creation resistance piece, made by Valentino, was an extravaganced, bey-coloured hat, with a large boob, similar to a penis, where the heads of the models were glued.
Other top-sized accessories have included nails decorated with nails, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of twins, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored towns had ribs and brought more of Hannibal Lecter's chosen accessories, and did not have high-quality knives.
One of the creatures seemed to be a sinking equipment, having a oxygen tube and glasses, while the other seemed to be a cold-cold cone.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a style of dress, with oversized clothing, you're lucky.
The stylists propose a return of huge dolls to luxury fashion stores.
The above-sized garments return after the appearance of the hat "La Bomba", the hat of straw with a large boor, seen all over the world, from Rihanna and to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the completely practical hat that appeared on all socialization networks caused the appearance of another creation oversized on the podium, each of the people paying for the beach, with a size as large as the bathroom suit that wears it.
The orange bag of rafie, with rafie brakes and a white leather handle, was the resistance piece of the spring-summer 2019 collection of Jacquemus's "La Riviera" at the Fashion Week of Paris
The star stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see the hats and beachmen oversized in luxury stores next summer, because the fashionmaker had such a powerful impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Linguistic skills, essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results for examinations, which is supported by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to provide services at the highest level of their students and parents.
Independent schools propose to prepare their students for high and higher education, chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak his own language, words reach his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the classes, with the highest promotion rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a Higher Grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher Grade A certificate in Mandarin; 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students obtained such a certificate.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as matter, are held as STEM subjects (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculums and in other areas.
A survey carried out by the British Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that for reasons given by employers for the fight against job vacancies, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, more and more linguistic skills become imperative for the preparation of young people for their career future.
With more opportunities for jobs that require foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov on over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to engage in a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by one percent of two digits, 15%.
Therefore, investment in learning foreign languages is important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially in developing economies, children will be more likely to find significant jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be more languages of choice in independent schools, with teaching frameworks that are specialized in this field.
Independent Scottish schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future may be.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so that it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It's good to do it (I need to do it).
John Edward is director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron will start at Lakers Sunday, in San Diego
Expectation is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James begin with Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James would play in the opening of Sunday's pressure against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
But how many minutes will the game remain to be established.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James would probably play limited minutes.
Following the training from the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the Six-Game Lakers program.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need games in the press to prepare," he said.
Trump's West Virginia election time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five Trump meetings scheduled next week, which includes stops in places where the election is favorable to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote for the candidate he has chosen for the seat of free from the Supreme Court is suspended temporarily, Trump wants to strengthen support for future elections by the middle of the term, as the Republics risk losing control of the Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump's election meeting take place in West Virginia tonight and where can I track him online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00, east coast time, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can track Trump's West Virginia electoral rally online through the live video stream below, on YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss Brett Kavanaugh's hearing this week, a candidate at the Supreme Court, hearing that has become tense due to allegations of improper sexual behavior, while the Senate's expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week, so that the FBI investigates the charges.
But the main objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans, who face tough elections in November, to win some ground.
Thus, President Trump's campaign stated that the role of these five meetings next week is "to energize volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority held in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important for its programme that the president will travel as many states as possible before entering the very crowded campaign season," a spokesman for Trump's campaign said to Reuters, who did not want to be called.
Programmed to take place in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening's meeting could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be presented in the Pittsburgh mass media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won the elections at a difference of more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is being conducted in the polls.
"The fact that the president came to try to propel him in the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team gives evidence of determination and continues to fight to keep the chance for simple trials that start Sunday
After three clear mastered sessions, it is possible that the foursomes of Saturday afternoon would have been the exact thing that Cupa Ryder needed.
The always oscillating pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the sports world, but players really believe in it, so much more in competitions like this.
So where's their motivation now?
"They led us with six points, now the difference is just four points, so we're based on this drop for a little motivation," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point advance, when there are still twelve more points in play.
Americans, says Spieth, feel that the game begins to change in favor of them and that there are plenty of reasons for encouragement, of which the most important is the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and have won every three out of four points.
Spielth sent the mines to the green zone with a lethal precision, being an example to his colleagues.
Those juicy wallets of celebration became increasingly louder as the progress progressed, especially when he wrote a crucial point through which he evened the score in the fourth match, after he and Thomas had been driven two points after the first two holes.
The hit that won the game at 15 was celebrated with a similar urlet, a urlet that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
"You just have to concentrate and worry only about your own game," Spieth says.
That's how many of these players are left.
18 holes to leave a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spielth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange, but adorable couple of Europe has won four out of four games and it seems I can't fail.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that did not need any additional hit on Saturday afternoon, but this statement is valid both for Saturday mornings and for Friday afternoons, even for the new points of Friday mornings.
This performance and how their energy seems to flow towards and among the enthusiastic audience reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they ended up with a potential victory of the Europeans when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time, at different doors.
Discussions on the glory of Europeans remain premature for a while.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson passed quickly from Sergio Garcia, the hero in the morning at the fourballs test, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two doubles at the first nine holes have sunk Spanish and Swedish into a pit so deep that they were not even close to getting out of it.
Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
The samples of fourballs and foursomes are fascinating and deserve to be followed closely because of the interactions between pairs, data and data tips and the way in which a strategy can be modified on the spot.
Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the final day, but this forum session has shown and that the US team has the motivation to continue fighting, which some, especially those in the United States, doubt.
Europe runs 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after it's finished the fourballs and the foursomes on Saturday with an advantage of 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led offensively with two victories in front of an exciting Tiger Woods, which has so far increased their score at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to win back the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made many mistakes at the trial of the morning fourballs and won the 3 to 1.
The US opposed a more serious resistance to the foursome test, where it won two matches, but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points out of the 12 simple Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European news that wins four points in turn, and along with Molinari, a pair named "Mollwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair that wins four of the four opening matches in the entire history of the Ryder Cup.
After they smashed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs test, they held themselves in a wonderful way to defeat the downfall of Woods and the American newsmen Bryson Dechambe with an even clearer score, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in the two Saturday matches, had occasional genius sculptures, but so far lost 19 of the 29 matches at fourballs and foursomes, seven of which were successive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning fourballs session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson to the foursome test and confronted Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, positions one and three in the world.
Europe, however, did not have a course without obstacles on this pleasant and refreshing day in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, triple winner of major tournaments, and Justin Thomas became the benchmark for Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win with 2-1 a match against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a fourball test, then returned later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 to 3 in a foursome test, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Cup Ryder managed a team to recover a four-point deficit in simple trials, although, because they are the current owners of the trophy, Furyk players only need an equal result.
However, after being in place for the second two days in a row, a Sunday contraction seems unlikely.
North Korea declares that there is no "no chance" to disarm unilaterally as long as there is no confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea said on Saturday to the United Nations that the extension of sanctions will deepen confidence in the United States and that it is impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the North Korea Global Council that "significant measures have been implemented to prove their faith" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and testing rockets, dismantling the nuclear testing site and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any appropriate response from the US," he said.
"If we cannot trust the US, we will not trust our national security capabilities and, in such circumstances, we cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's family's objections to Washington's opposition to a "sampled" approach to denouncing, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps, his statement seemed significant because it did not directly reject unilateral denouncing, as the Phenian did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump in a summit between a US president and North Korea leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim undertook to make progress towards a "declaration of the Korean peninsula", while Trump provided security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea has been looking for an official end to the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has said that the Phenian must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has not made requests for the release of the hard international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on the option of "first denuclearisation" and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coercive way, even objecting to "the declaration of the end of war"," Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can infuse us is an illusion that only people who do not know us.
But the problem is that extended sanctions deepen our lack of confidence."
He did not mention any plans on a second summit between Kim and Trump, referred to by the US leader to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, President of South Korea, for the past five months, adding: "If the problem of denuclearisation had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Even under these conditions, Ri's tone of speech was very different from that of last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the U.S. territory with rockets from North Korea after "Mr. Malefic President" Trump called Kim a "ho-rocket" in a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which threatened North Korea last year with "total destruction", praised Kim for his courage to launch the disarmament process, but stated that work was only beginning and that sanctions would remain valid until North Korea is denuclearized.
Wednesday, Trump said there is no time planned for this and added: "It doesn't matter if it takes two or three years or five months."
China and Russia say the Phenian should be compensated by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: "The application of the Security Council sanctions must continue to be effective and uninterrupted until we obtain complete, final and confirmed denouncing."
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block the funds for nuclear programmes and the ballistic missiles of the Phenian.
Pompeo met with Ri on the colours of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit the Phenian again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not have too good results.
When he left Phenian in July, he said that progress had been made, but only a few hours later, North Korea reported that it had made "gangsterous threats".
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has committed to decommissioning a missile launch ramp and a nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate measures.
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate things" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised to Singapore and that he wanted to normalise his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on how to rest enough
A new course from Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing culture of macho that makes them subject to learning sessions "all night", energized with much caffeine.
A scientist has discovered that, often, students of the most prestigious universities in the world do not even master the basic concepts of how they should care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of this guy in the U.S.
It was inspired to create the course after holding a conference on the impact of sleeplessness on the ability to learn.
"At last, a girl came and said to me, "Why is this just said to me now, in the last year?"
She told me she never talked about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, introduced in the premiere this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance, as well as general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The course that takes an hour can involve a series of interactive tasks.
A section presents a picture of a home room, and students can click on coffee houses, losses, sports pants and books to tell them what are the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficits, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily program.
“ We know that we cannot change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that makes students proud that they have learned all night still exists, says it, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure imposed on students have transformed sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sleep sufficient, of a good quality, should be a student's "secret weapon" for combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain think the body is hungry, making the students feel that they are hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler create the course after participating in one of his first courses at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all post-university students to complete a similar study programme before joining this institution where the competition is fierce.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students schedule an alarm to know when it is time to sleep, as well as for waking hours, and to know what the harmful effects of the "blue light" are from electronic screens and LEDs, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to win Gerrard's team
Rangers suffer from another case of displacement depression because Dolly Menga's beating condemned Steven Gerrard's invincible team to a 1-0 assault on Livingstone.
Ibrox's team wanted to get the first victory to move from the triumphal with 4-1 won in February against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team managed to administer Gerrard's second defeat of 18 games as coach, which puts Rangers with eight points behind Hearts, the authorial leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga recorded seven minutes before the break and uninspired players from the Rangers didn't seem at any time able to equalize.
Rangers fell so on the sixth position in the classification, while Livingston went up the third, behind the Hibernate, to a difference of one goal.
And Rangers could also deal with other problems, because the Calum Spence Mouse Arbitrary had to be treated for a head injury after an object was, apparently, thrown into the hair of the visiting team fans.
Gerard changed eight players from the lot that easily won against Air in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players from Livingstone who managed to get an equal with Hearts last week and has all the reasons to be proud of the way his well-trained lot drowned his opponents during the game.
Even if Rangers had a superior possession, Livingstone had more efficient use of the mines they had.
It should have been only two minutes after the start of the game, when Menga's first step moved Scott Pittman to the gate protected by Allan McGregor, but the middle house missed a very good opportunity.
A deep-seated hit by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her to the bar.
Rangers took control, but left the impression that more hope than trust in their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos believed that he should have received a penalty when he had been harassed by Steven Lawless in the 15th minute of the game, but Albert Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian request.
Rangers managed only two hits on the front door in the first round, but the former porter on Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was not at all disturbed by Lassana Coulibally's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak hit.
Although the goal of the 34 minutes of Livingstone did not respect the trend of the game, no one can deny that it was worth it, even for the effort put forward.
Again, Rangers failed to prevent a deep-rooted Jacobs.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent Scott Robinson's ball, which kept calm and passed on to Menga, who ended up with a simple hit.
Gerard acted on a break when he changed Ryan Kent with Coulibally; this move almost gave way immediately when the extreme focused Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of the shoes to block him.
However, Livingstone continued to attract visitors to exactly the same type of match she prefers, with Lithgow and Halkett who intercepted the center after the center.
Holt's team could have extended the advantage in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' strike, then Lithgow sent the corner hit with his head next door.
Glenn Middleton, reserve at Rangers, asked for a penalty at the end of the game, when he hit Jacobs, but again Thomson did not agree.
Almanah: the inventor of Geiger's office
And now, a page from our Sunday Sunday: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and CONTINUE...), is the day that was born in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as Geiger counter.
An essential device for science since then, the Geiger Count has become an essential for pop culture, as was the case in the movie "Clopotele de San Coronado" (1950), where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played in the role of a cowboy with unscientific inclinations:
Man: "What else is this?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear these boxes, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted from radioactive activity in minerals."
Evans: "Yes, I hear a lot of applause!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before he was 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells and destroy them
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, their alteration in a laboratory
They can "detect" a common protein of many cancers and then are re-injected
A test vaccine offers promising results in patients with a cancer range.
Ovarian cancer of a woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise harmful cells has been missing for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can "detect" a common protein of many cancers, called HER2, then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Oncology Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "determins the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, to take immune cells from patients and to "learn them" to target cancer cells, also worked to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a Trump's support diary, while wearing a MAGA hat, after the appearance of SNL.
It didn't come out too well.
Kanye West was shot in the studio during Saturday Night Live's show after a show in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he intended to run for the 2020 elections.
After playing the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great hat, the artist resigned in a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"Many times when I'm talking to a white person, I'm asked, "How can you like Trump? He's racist"
Well, if I had been worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a scene where Matt Damon played, in which the Hollywood star took over Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee on the charges of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, filming with West's diatrabe was loaded on social media by Comrade Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock is trying to get over West with this post.
In addition, the West complained to the public that he had problems in the hives because of his superior.
"They tried to scare me into the cages.
They told me not to wear this hat.
I was attacked!
They told me I'd come down a lot," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how much I've gotten down?" then he said, "I'm going to get Superman's blanket, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try with love."
His comments attracted audiences at least twice, and the members of the SNL team seemed to be stuck, Variety reported; a member of this team said to the publication: "In the studio there was a complete silence."
West was invited as a last-hour replacement for the soloist Ariana Grande, whose lover, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West raised many cracks when he played song I Love it dressed as a glass of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest spirits of us: I'M MULTUSC THAT I'M GLOATA."
Karen Hunter, the head of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that the West simply "was himself and that is wonderful".
"I choose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art") about whom I think he embraces and expresses a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, announcing that from now on he is "the one officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name; the West walks behind Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former legend of music, Prince, changed his name into a symbol and then into "the earlier known artist as Prince".
A charge of attempted murder for an injection into a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defence lawyer is expected to be in front of the Belfast Court for months.
The allegations will be analysed by the Public Prosecutor.
Kit Harington, the star in the Throne Bridge, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for the role of Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of the Thrones Urzeala, produced by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of macho hero, saying that presenting these roles on the screen makes the boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said it seemed to him that "there was something wrong" and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity could be managed in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his colleague from the Throne Office, Rose Leslie, who is only 31 years old, admitted that it is "very determined" to talk about this problem.
"Personally, I am very determined to talk about it now: where did I fail with masculinity?" he asked.
"What have we learned men about how to be adults, considering the problem we are dealing with now?"
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through very male characters.
He continued: “What is born again, and what is taught?
What does young boys learn from TV and from the street, what makes them think they have to be a certain type of man?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because it's clear that something wrong with the young has happened."
In the interview, he acknowledged that he would not play in any series based on the Throne Urzela after the series ends in the summer of next year, saying he "ended with the battlefields and horses".
In November, Kit will play in a new production of the True West Theatre of Sam Shepard, which presents the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a fool.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him because of the series of the Thrones was that he met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife when I did this show, so she assured me the future of my family and my life from now on," Kit said.
Rose played in the role of Ygritte, Jon Snow's girlfriend, the character played by Kit in the winning fantasy series of several Emmy awards.
The couple got married in June 2018, on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this disease in China, officials say.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike those of the past.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced close to zero, Chinese health officials say at a conference in Yunnan province.
From one year to the next, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered very widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually get married to a woman.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases stem from inadequate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to medicines against HIV as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has disclosed the data of senators of the Republican Party, talks about "dangerous minions" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters filed on Saturday the charges under which a member of his team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges are made by analysts and websites of "extreme right".
"Minitions, lies and other miserable lies," Waters said in a post on Twitter.
The information disclosed included the senators' personal address and phone numbers. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a hearing in the Senate on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated judge at the Supreme Court.
The information leak took place shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and presented the information of a Waters team member, Hill reported.
"These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of the team whose identity, personal and security information has been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie."
Waters' statements were criticised online shortly after they were made, including the former White House Press Secretary Ari Flescher.
"This denial is angry," Flescher wrote.
“This suggests that he does not have the temperature needed to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be a challenge.
The defendant's motive must not be undermined.
It must be calm and quiet."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, criticised by democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican who is running against Waters in the mid-term elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
"Importy, if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office warned “the appropriate legal authorities and entities regarding these false accusations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be responsible in front of the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members."
Review Johnny English again hits: the flagless parody of spy movies, with Rowan Atkinson in the main role
It has become a tradition to search for Brexit's associated meanings in any new British film, but this also does not apply to the new film series of parodys of action films that has it as the main character of Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English.
Will this zeflaming satire of how strange we are to become the new opportunity to export the nation?
Anyway, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with blind eyes and rubber face, was renewed to the second time the license to destroy everything. The name of the character means, firstly, that it is a general comic creation for the cinematographic audience in English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, a secret secret agent who, despite his claims to luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a knife tip from that guy who contributed with a single note on the chariots of Fire theme to the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
The character is based on the explorer and the mysterious man without the country that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's TV ads, which left a mess behind.
This last adventure of the JE has one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the wheels of the rotor hit his carpet easily.
The gift Atkinson has for physical comedy is highlighted, but humor is quite weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the "serious" films, such as those in the 007 series or the impossible Mission, offer comic moments as an ingredient with confidence.
The murder seems to address more children than adults and, for me, Johnny English's adventures are not as inventive and intelligent as Atkinson's dumb film gangs when playing in Bean's role.
As usual, the assumption is that the UK has serious problems.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies and revealed the identities of British agents undercover, towards the dissipation of the service agent, a pitiful role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who is already suffering a serious crisis because of a decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything he can with his similar character Teresa May, but the scenario does not give him a chance to shine.
Its managers in the field of classified information inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so that an agent in the reserve must be activated.
It's Johnny English's uncle himself, now working as a teacher in a high school, which also teaches how to be a cover-up agent. Here are some nice darts, because English conducts a school-style spy academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall, for an emergency meeting, then met with his partner from time to time, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a bit annoying.
Thus, these Batman and Robin of the creation of interferences in the Secret Service of His Majesty return to action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletin, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the spell of a charismatic billionaire of the technology industry claiming to be able to solve the UK's IT problems: the Jason Volta disaster, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start in an adise of the bourish adventures: worn out in waiters, set fire to a French-style restaurant, creates chaos when it snuck on the board of Volta's luxury boat, then English triggers anarchy in pure form when trying to use a set of glasses for virtual reality to familiarize itself with the inside of Volta's house.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but, although it would be a nice and colorful film, it looks like a television production for children.
A pretty mediocre movie.
As with the other movies with Johnny English, I can't stop asking myself: can't the British film industry even give Rowan Atkinson a role as his talent?
The labs deny that they plan to let the British work four days a week, but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labourist Party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
It seems that the party wants the company's bosses to benefit from the potential savings due to the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) giving the employees another day off.
So employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not be changed.
The sources say that the idea would be "consistent" with the party's economic programme, which wants to strike a balance in favour of the workers.
The shift to work week for four days is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way that workers can benefit from the change of economy.
A source from the Labour Party’s leadership stated to The Sunday Times: “The announcement of a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an appropriate ambition in addressing the economic recovery party in favour of the worker, as well as in the overall strategy of the industrial party."
The Labourist Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day work week was one of the Green Party's promises in the 2017 campaign for general elections.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labourist Party.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said: "The four-day work week is not a party policy and is not taken into account in the calculation of the party."
The chancellor of the shadow cabinet, John McDonnell, took advantage of the Labourers' conference last week to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said it is decided to take back the power from "directors without face" and "principles" from utility suppliers.
The plans of the Chancellor of the shadow cabinet also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water supply regions could not recover their shares in full, because the Labour Government could perceive "deductions" due to established offences.
It also confirmed plans to appoint employees in company management councils and to create property funds by giving up 10% of the own capital of private sector companies to employees, who will receive such annual dividends of up to about 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal in the "60 minutes" show if Kavanaugh's investigation by the FBI would make him reconsider.
The FBI's investigation of the charges brought by Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed his final vote on his candidacy as a judge in the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the Republican senators might be convinced that he would no longer support him on the basis of the FBI's findings.
In an interview on Sunday, the correspondent "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make him reconsider.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do this than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said this from the beginning of the hearings; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when that happened, when the charges came up, and I asked him, "Are you guilty?"
The answer was decided, quickly, without mistake."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be buried in a rock.
"I am decided on Brett Kavanaugh, so some explosive charges would be needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly rejects the accusations," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the persons named by her confirmed the report.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt something's going to change."
What is the Festival of Global Citizens and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual musical event that will be attended by an impressive group of stars, with an equally impressive mission: eradicating world poverty.
Until the seventh edition, the Festival of Global Citizens will attract tens of thousands of people on the Central Park Square, not only to track artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the true purpose of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Festival of Global Citizens, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of lawyers hoping to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (except where they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers had to purchase a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, making phone calls or other significant things that help to raise awareness of the goal of eliminating global poverty.
But what was the success of the Global Citizens' Festival when I'm only 12 years old to reach the goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism", a concept that refers to people who feel they have done something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizens, since 2011 more than 19 million "actions" have been recorded by its supporters, who have promoted different objectives.
The organisation says that these actions have prompted world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group spoke of 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, in which at least 10 billion dollars were already spent or tight.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership with the headquarters of investors and intermediaries in the UK who have committed to "help children grow up to their full potential", which has promised to offer Rwanda 35 million dollars to contribute to the eradication of malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4700 Twitter messages from global citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens as well as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition become only a footnote in the history book," says Tracey Ullman, Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, in front of the majority during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions have been taken in Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced that it will finance the The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website: "What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult path, sometimes we will fall and make mistakes.
But like the great movements for civil rights or anti-apartheid that took place before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists who will play at the event this year in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the naval forces for a "block" to exacerbate Russia's energy exports, says the Secretary of Internal Affairs
Washington may, "if necessary", appeal to the naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, has revealed the US Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why I am in the Middle East is that I want to mediate energy sales, as I do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and methods to manage the situation.
"The United States has the capacity, through our naval forces, to ensure that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade, so that energy does not come into the market," he said.
Zinke is addressed to participants at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that declares the US "voice of the energy consumer".
It continued by comparing the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels," he said, saying about Russia "knows one thing" because of the fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The declarations come at a time when Trump administration is trying to increase natural gas exports to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "indecent" project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion project of Nord Stream 2, which will double the capacity of existing conduct to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin said that the U.S.'s fierce opposition to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we look at things the same way: energy cannot be an instrument by which to put pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, Minister of Energy in Russia, after a meeting with Rick Perry, US Energy Secretary in Moscow in September.
The US position drew criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industrial organisation in Germany, the Federation of Industries in Germany (BDI), asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the fact that a third state is involved in our energy issues," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is "serious" to run for the 2020 presidential elections, Senator of Massachusetts says
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, said on Saturday that he must "think seriously" if he applies to presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting at the capital of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy.
"It is time for a woman to go to Washington and repair our strict government, and that is why a strong woman is needed," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will think seriously if I run for presidential elections."
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during his first meeting, saying that he "directed the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a message posted on Friday, Warren said "normally we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a survey published Thursday showed that no majority of Warren's electors do believe it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such an application.
The poll showed more support for a former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy: 38% of respondents support a potential candidate and 48% oppose it.
Other names of well-known democrats who could run in 2020 are those of Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Biden said he'd decide officially by January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress syndrome she suffers at a meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after falling into September.
Monday night, he was arrested and accused in a case of domestic violence
"The tears through which my own son passed, through which he passed after his return... can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of the post-traumatic stress syndrome and the traces of the injuries that our soldiers are returning with," said the assembled audience at Donald Trump's support meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant of the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "will come back a little different, harder, wondering whether there is more respect for what they and their soldiers of the army and the air forces, as well as all the other members of the Army, have done for the country".
It was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of a domestic violence and holding a firearm in a state of drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Columbia District contests a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape the violence caused by men or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and District have completed a friendly request for care Friday, in Washington, to support a poll on asylum-seekers, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions process that the American Civil Liberties Union organization initiated in August against federal policy was not revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons, members of a guest", abused her, but US officials refused her asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state attorney who represents Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produced a large number of asylum-seekers in the US as nations facing a generalized problem with domestic guests and violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy cancelled a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Council which allowed immigrants without acts trying to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said Friday that the new policy "is ignoring the decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal law says that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a limitation violates this principle," writes in the request of a friend of care.
In addition, lawyers argue that the policy that refuses entry of immigrants affects the US economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "furnish the necessary workforce".
Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney General, ordered judges in June for immigration cases to no longer grant asylum to victims who were trying to escape the abuse and violence of the guests.
"The asylum is granted to those who leave their country driven by persecution or fear because of discrimination based on race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or because of a political opinion," Sessions said on June 11, when politics announced.
The role of asylum was never that of solving all the problems people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Rescue operations desperate in Palu, where the number of deaths doubled, in a race against the timer to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become more and more serious.
"The situation seems very tense," Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said, aligning her baby with fever suffering at an evacuation center in the destroyed town of Palu.
"Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is not enough."
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flood-like goods, trying to save everything that could be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale, were overstated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures at the spine and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients are treated in the open air due to strong and continuous replications.
He has eyes full of tears when he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the hotel room from the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was caught in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, then just shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope I'm safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "abuse" of "propaganda claims"
A week after an official newspaper in China published a four-page advertisement in a daily U.S. of praise for the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, U.S. Ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the American press to distribute propaganda materials.
US President Donald Trump referred Wednesday to the supplement paid by China in Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of mixing in the November 6 elections for Congress, an accusation that China rejects.
The charge that Beijing is trying to get involved in US elections marked what US officials said to Reuters is a new phase in a escalating campaign in Washington to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are now stuck in a growing trade war, which entails price increases for imports.
The prices imposed by China as a reward, at the beginning of the trade war, were created to affect exporters from countries such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, said experts from China and the USA.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former governor in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijingul injured American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In a Sunday editorial published in Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China "continues to abuse this by publishing advertisements in our own free press".
"When propaganda spreads through the publication of an ad in Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect the tradition of freedom of expression and free press in America," Branstad writes.
"In return, you will find a few voices of dissidents on the street from Beijing and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent opinions that Chinese citizens have about China's worrying economic path, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say what newspaper it is about.
Republicans alienate female voters prior to the mid-term elections due to the Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
As many of the top republics support and protect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, several charges of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a counter-reaction, especially by women, during the forthcoming elections since the mid-term term.
The emotions created by this scandal have been extremely strong, and most Republicans who have discussed it publicly intend to continue the vote.
"Such reactions will not be forgotten," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's latest-time initiative (the Arizona representative) on an FBI investigation would calm the angry electorate.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow, and they will not forget in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and spokesman of the progressive group, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors called "Come November!" while demonstrating on the Senate halls when Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee chose to continue the Kavanaugh nomination process despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the democrats will be very great," said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news site.
"People say they were already very big and that's true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among female indecisive voters from the suburbs and the young electorate, between 18 and 29 years of age, who, although they do not attack the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed allegations of sexual abuse brought to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a counter-reaction could occur if the Republicans continued the confirmation process.
"This has turned into an intrusion for Republicans," said Michael Steele, the president of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote or the possibility that Kavanaugh would be confirmed, but also how the Republicans treated this situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, an electoral support group for the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be relatively divided with regard to the party that they should believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh: a little more seems to believe it afterwards.
A new survey carried out by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents believe in State or believe that Ford's testimony is likely to be true, while 35% said that it believed in State or that Kavanaugh's testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh probably lied or certainly, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least another person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford swore under oath in front of the Senate's judicial committee that Kavanaugh abused her, in a state of drunkenness, at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nomination to the Supreme Court exposed the genital organs in front of her when she attended a party while they were students in Yale in 1980.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in the field of technology, Inrupt, is a solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt is "global domination".
"Now we have to do it," he said about startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data archives" or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would be all available in one browser, all of them at once.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has full control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this "personal consolidation through data".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt contributes with adequate resources, processes and skills, so as to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely over-date.
"We don't ask for permission."
In a post published on the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even after the Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergy who won the Crucea Victoria in World War I is celebrated
The only cleric of the Anglican Church who won a medal Crucea Victoria as a fighter in the First World War was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918 at Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a lunetist four days later and never knew that he had been awarded the highest military honor of the Great Britain.
A memorial stone was set up on Saturday by his two nephews during the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the nephews, Michael Vann, said it was "wondered by symbolic" that the stone would be developed exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal of Saint-Quentin "by a very good watch and under the intense fire of artillery and mitrals".
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with a "imaginative bravure", opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked alone a artillery cube and managed to eliminate three of the weapons of detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German lunetist on October 4, 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "a thing I know I will never be equal to him, but it makes me feel dead".
He, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the parade, which was led by the Youth Orchestra Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said that "it is very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give it".
The MMA fans stayed three nights to see Bellator 206, but received animated drawings with Peppa Pig, instead
Imagine that you spent three nights following Bellator 206, an event with many stars, just so you can't follow the main event.
The San Jose event programme contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and had to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, viewers in the United Kingdom were amazed when the broadcast was replaced with an episode from Peppa Pig.
Some were not at all grateful because they stayed three nights to see the struggle.
A fan described on Twitter the transition to animated drawing for children as "a kind of bad joke".
"The government regulations say that this content is not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to change to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Bellator's vice president for marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa Porcushor, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator's company, said that in the future, they will program their events in such a way that they can be followed by viewers from the UK.
"When I'm thinking about rerouting, I think we could probably solve it," Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won't be able to do that until Sunday, our time, or months, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, I thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't about that, it was about a government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We'll sum up five fights instead of six, as we usually do.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" because of sexuality
Olympic sculptor Tom Daley says he grew up feeling that he's inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he only realized when he got to school that "not everyone is like me".
Invited to the first Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne, on Radio 4, he said he talked about the rights of gay people to give them another "hope".
The sportsman also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presentation of the tradition show, will miss a few months due to a disease.
Invited to the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child he felt "downside" others because "it was not socially acceptable for me to like boys and girls."
He said: “So far, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different, were the real things that gave me the strength and resistance to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove he was "someone," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympic Games has become a renowned supporter of the LGBT campaigns and has benefited from the appearance at the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to ask several countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak because he felt fortunate that he could live without a trace, and because he wanted to give the other "hope".
The triple world champion said "was taken by surprise" because he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married Oscar's winning filmmaker last year, who is 20 years older than he, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a fragrant age," he attended the first Olympics when he was only 14 years old, and his father died of cancer after three years, he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who's been through the same good and bad times.
In June, the two became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, says Daley, changed his "whole perspective".
"If I had been asked last year, I wouldn't have been interested in anything but winning a gold medal," he said.
“ You know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears his father's name, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted to find out was if he received tickets for the 2012 London Olympic Games, because he wanted to be first.
"I couldn't tell him "you couldn't be first, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and barely after he stopped breathing and died I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that I had dreamed of a whole life going out in front of the spectators of my country at the Olympic Games, there is no nicer feeling," he said.
This also inspired him in selected music, Proud of Heather Small, a melody that encouraged him before the Olympic Games and still excites him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15.
Mickelson, out of shape, went to the reserve bank on Saturday, in Cupa Ryder.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday, when he will play in the forty-seven games of Cupa Ryder, but he will have to go back to a good form so that it is not an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, who plays in the binary event for the twelfth time, another record, was passed on to Captain Jim Furik's reserve bank for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as it has been many times for the United States team, the major tournament winner has shared the day between being major for the teamers and practicing the beats, hoping that he will correct what was wrong.
The 48-year-old player has never had the right drives, not even in the best period of his career, so it's not the best choice for the narrow terrain at Le Golf National, where long rough areas often punish the wrong hits.
And if the ground is not a pretty big challenge, in the ninth match on Sunday, Mikkelson will face Francesco Molinari, the mythical champion of the British Open, who joined the newsmen Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches of the week.
Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial to Americans, leading with four points into the 12 simple matches, which must begin in force at this stage.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player's ability, but he couldn't say anything else anyway.
"He fully understood the role he had today, beat me on his shoulder, hugged me and told me he would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play in two games.
I imagined more, but this happened and that's how we thought we had to proceed.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's memory for the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which was no longer raised at the level of his personal memory.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 lost and seven-and-a-half, although Furik said his presence has brought some tangible benefits to the team.
"It's funny, it's sarcastic, smart, it likes to joke with players, it's a great guy in the team's lobby," he explained.
"I think young players are having fun with him, it was fun to see them doing this during the week.
His role is more important, it's not just about the game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that considerable progress could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of the simple trials in the Ryder Cup can easily be transformed into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danish started in the 1997 Valderrama game when the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans with five points, but only if he managed to overcome them with a minimum difference, from 141⁄2 to 1311⁄2.
"I remember having a considerable advance in Valderrama; I had a great advance in Brooklyn, where I lost, and in Valderrama, where I could barely win," said Bjorn (in picture) after following as the 2018 team, who won with 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, and now leads with 10-6 on Le Golf National.
"So history shows me, me and my team, that it's not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at the top of the race.
Let's get out on the ground and do everything perfect.
The game is not ready until the points have passed on the table.
We have a goal and this is to win this trophy, it must remain objective.
I always said, we have to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we know and what awaits us on the other hand: the best players in the world."
Glad to see how his players managed a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I am not quick to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow it's all the same.
Individual performances are important tomorrow, and this is different.
It's great to be on the ground with a partner when things go well, but when you're on your own, then you're tested to the maximum, as a golfer.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, that it must be in the best form tomorrow.
Now leave their partner behind and have to play as well as I can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, hopes that his players will play better at the simple test than they did with their partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furik himself was on both sides of such a return the last day: he was on the winning team at Brooklyn, then in the losing when Europe succeeded the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every word," he replied when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, managed to encourage his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick victories, like at Brooklyn, like at Medina.
When the inertia develops in a direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those mid-range matches.
We created the right lot and ordered the players as we wanted, you know, we're trying to create a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
"I have chosen this group of players, in this order, because I think it covers all subjects," Bjorn said about the batch for a simple test.
The new German warship, again delayed
Germany's newest fleets should have been operational in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War, but this will only happen year after year, due to broken systems and rising costs, the local press reported.
The entry into service of the Rhineland-Pfalz ship, the standard new Baden-Wuerttemberg ship, was now delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military speaker.
The river should have been introduced into the maritime forces in 2014, but problems that arose after delivery affected this ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Military Navy in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is assumed that they will be provided with a strong tuna, with a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vas rockets, as well as with stealth technologies, which provide a radar, infrared and low-acoustic printing.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; new frigates should be possible to go to missions for two years without returning to the original port.
However, the continuing delays mean that these last-generation war vessels, which are said to increase Germany's maritime strength, will be already old before entering service, notes Die Zeit.
F125 was discussed in the press last year, when Germany's Military Navy officially refused to take the vessel and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy Military returned a vessel to the builder after delivery.
There is not much information available about the reasons for the refusal, but the media in Germany cited a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that would have made the war vessel useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the teams of the older crew of the Bremen class.
In addition, it has been proved that the vessel has too much weight, which has reduced its performance and limited the military's ability to add future equipment.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton vessel "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as the vessels used by Germans in World War II.
Alongside the faulty mechanisms, and the cost of the whole project, including equipment training, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached a drop of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the initial price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newest frigates are of particular importance in view of the latest warnings that say the maritime power of Germany is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Military Navy "started to remain without vessels that could be sent to missions".
The official said that the problem grew steadily over time, because old vessels were removed without being replaced with some new ones.
It noted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg Frigates had entered into service within the Military Marine.
National Trust spying on the secret life of the fairies
Our research that is carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands wants to reveal how the lilys use the surrounding environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that discoveries will reveal new things about the behavior of these unique flying mammals and will help future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will examine common and pigme petals, as well as eardrums and water petals in the Inverewe Gardens of Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be located in key locations around the property to monitor the activity of the lilies during the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using manual detectors.
The specialized audio analysis of all recordings will assess the frequency of the sounds made by the lilys and what species emits certain sounds.
They will be produced and a map of the habitat and a report, to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a scale in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal what habitat areas are the most important for mammals and how they are used in each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of the area, and which is the best way to maintain forest parcels for mammals and other associated species.
The lily populations in Scotland and throughout Britain have fallen considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects their shells, but also by loss of habitat.
And the wind turbines and the public lighting are risks, as are the traps for flies and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also attacks on domestic cats.
In fact, the lilys are not blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the fence.
They use sophisticated echoing techniques to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight route.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is very serious about lilys.
They have ten trained experts, who conduct periodic studies, check the cages and sometimes perform rescue missions.
The organization created even the first and only lily reservation in Scotland, on the Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, where there are eight of the ten lily species in Scotland.
Mosquito's manager, David Thompson, says that this is the ideal place for pets.
"Here, in Treve, the area is wonderful for lilys," he says.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there are many things we don't know about roses, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need to multiply."
It underlines the importance of looking for lilys before carrying out property maintenance work, as simple unintended destruction of a mother cow could kill up to 400 women and chickens, which can destroy the entire local population.
Lilies are protected, and the killing, harassment or disturbance of their cubs, as well as the destruction of their cubs, are prohibited actions.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Preservation Trust official, encouraged the public to help him.
It said: “We still have a lot of learning about roses and we don’t know how the populations evolve for many of our species.”
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape while lawyers prepare to give the German magazine a trial
Cristiano Ronaldo said that the charges against him are "face news" and that some people "will "advertise" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to put in German journal Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The attack by Portugal and the Juventus team was accused of rapeing a woman in America, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday that the footballer paid $375.000 to not talk about the incident.
A few hours after the charges were published, in a video posted on Instagram Live for the 142 million followers of his, Ronaldo, aged 33, said they were "face news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the golden balloon winner in front of the video camera.
"I want to make an ad using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for these accusations, which they called "an unacceptable report of suspicions of private life", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says the player will apply for compensation for “equivalent moral damage to an appropriate amount for the seriousness of the act, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009, in an apartment at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he violated an anal, in accordance with the documents submitted to the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that, after an incident, Ronaldo fell into her knees and told her that she was "a good boy" in proportion to "99%", and that she was betrayed by that "a percentage".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accused, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims that she addressed the police and that the photographs of her injuries were taken to the hospital, but later she accepted an understanding outside the courtroom because she was "defeated by the possibility of revenge" and was concerned that "it would be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman now seeks to cancel that understanding because she continues to be traumatized by an accident.
At the time of the charge, Ronaldo was about to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian Juventus giant, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK "and regret forever" loss of car manufacturers
Britain "will regret forever" if it loses the status of world leader in car production after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is "anxious" that Toyota UK has told the BBC that, if Britain comes out of the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese auto manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border in the case of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The factory at Burnaston, where the brands Auris and Avensis of Toyota are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they are afraid of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, he will close the Oxford factory where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what producers call risks associated with the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line operates on the basis of the "fix-to-time" principle: for control-making machines, the pieces reach 37-minute intervals from UK and EU suppliers.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems at the border could arise which, according to industrial producers, could cause delays and a lack of play.
It would be impossible for Toyota to deposit more of the inventory for a day at his factory in Derbyshire, the company says, so the production would be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "calibrated precisely to avoid these delays at the border".
"There must be an agreement. We want to have the best agreement, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio Today's show.
"The evidence from not only from Toyota, but also from other producers, shows that we must be able to continue using what was a very successful supply chain set."
Toyota could not specify how long production would have to be stopped, but warned that large prices could reduce the competitive capacity of the long-term factory and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Trade Union at the factory, said that members are increasingly concerned: "The experience taught me that once these jobs are gone, these jobs are no longer coming back."
A spokesman for the government said: "I have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "a further week" because the fight for Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court, continued, said the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's electoral interventions, the links between Trump's and Russia's assistance and the potential for obstructing justice by the president.
The rumors about Trump's ability to release the Deputy Attorney General, thus endangering Mueller's independence, circulates around Washington for months.
At the beginning of the month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through Amendment 25 to the US Constitution.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
But last month he went to the White House, and reports say he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced for Thursday a meeting with Trump, which was then at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York.
Trump said "would prefer not" to grant Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal commission, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump requested a week's FBI inquiry into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed again the Senate's vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared at Fox News on Sunday.
Regarding the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: “It may be a week, or it may be a week, taking into account all the other things that are taking place now in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press up."
Some reporters would challenge this claim: Sanders had no press briefing at the White House since 10 September.
Mr. Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that reducing the number of briefings was not caused by antipathy to TV reporters, who liked to be shown, although he added: "I don't deny that they like to be shown."
Then, he suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president participates in several questions and answers sessions than all previous presidents," she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: "I have analyzed the figures."
"I'll have some more briefings," Sanders said, but "it seems much better for the press to have the opportunity to address the US President's direct questions, not me.
We're trying to do this most often and you've noticed that we've done this many times in the last few weeks, and discussions with the presidents of the United States will replace press briefings when it's available."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions or press conferences with the dunes visiting him.
The press conferences granted exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, having an improvised appearance, on bizarre slogans, in front of the assembled reporters.
A State Secretary of the Ministry of Health addressed in a letter to EU employees from the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland on Brexit-related issues
The Secretary of State wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their appreciation for the country and their desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Parliament of Scotland, has sent the letter under which there are less than six months until the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to bear the costs of requests for permanent residence status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, awaiting decisions in this fall.
However, the UK government has begun to prepare itself more and more for a different scenario, in which there would be no agreement for leaving the EU.
I know it's a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate my appreciation for each employee's contribution, regardless of nationality.
Members of the European Union, but also outside it, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and also benefit the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie is subjected to an emergency surgery after having suffered a headache
The Tennessee State Tigers Foundation, Christian Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after he suffered a hit on Saturday's head, in the match that his team lost in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores team, with a score of 31-27, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Master Coach Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the strike took place shortly before the break.
"He got to the pipe line and just collapsed," Reed said.
Abercrombie has put the oxygen mask by the physical preparations and medical personnel on the line before sitting on a plate and transporting it from the ground for a detailed assessment.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had come out of the operation she was subjected to at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details of the type/extension of the accident" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a student in year 2, is in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
On Saturday, it managed to do five totals before leaving the game, reaching a number of 18 cards throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will receive a higher judicial tax on the purchase of property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will pay a higher court fee on the purchase of property in the United Kingdom, so that additional money will be used to help homeless people, according to the new plans of the Conservative Party
This change will neutralize Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with the right to vote
Jurisdictional tax will apply to persons who are not taxpayers of taxes and taxes in the United Kingdom
The treasure is expected to reach up to 120 million pounds a year for the help of homeless people
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher rate of stamp tax on the purchase of property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, as Theresa May will announce today.
The exchange will be considered an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young people with the right to vote, promising houses with more favourable prices and targeting people with high incomes.
The higher due fee will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not taxpayers of taxes and taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money obtained in this way will be used to support the Government's efforts to help homeless people.
Suprataxa, which adds to the current court tax, including the levels raised two years ago for the second property and the properties purchased for rent, could reach a value of 3%.
The treasury is expected to bring this change up to 120 million pounds per year.
About 13% of the new properties built in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for those who want to buy their first house.
Several prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "breathing ghost" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending a large part of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the tax on stamps to help young people buy their first house.
It accused the large construction firms of maintaining high ownership prices as a result of the acquisition of land without using them and asked Theresei May to give up tax on affordable houses in order to solve the "house problem" in the UK.
Corbyn announced a number of proposals for attractive real estate reforms, including rent controls and the cessation of unfavourable evacuations.
He also wants to offer the councils greater power as regards the construction of new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my prime minister to the fulfillment of the British dream, a better life for every new generation.
And that means solving the existing problems on the real estate market.
The Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with offices abroad, to be able to buy homes as easily as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of holding a house has become a very distant one, and living in unbearable conditions is too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to be the manager of Scotland's national team"
Jack Ross, the Sunderland football team manager, said that "the goal of the final" is to become, at a given time, Scotland's national team manager.
The Scottish, 42-year-old, enjoys the challenge of "rehabilitating" the North-Estonian club, which is currently on the 3rd place in the First League, with a three-point difference to the first place.
He moved to the team this summer at the Luminian Stadium after he managed, in the past season, the return of the St. Mirren football team to the first Scottish Premiership division.
"I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We got to national team B and so on," Ross told the BBC Sports Sound.
"But I spent a lot of my childhood following Scottish matches at Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will have this opportunity only if I succeed as the club manager."
Among Ross' predecessors, as Sunderland Club managers, are Dick Moyes, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of the Alloa Athletic club said he had no emotion to be the successor of such sacred names and to such an important club after he refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The only thing that worries me and could affect my success is the question "Can I help this team get back to the Premier League?"
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow it to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to make it there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel a successful man is to contribute to the club's return to the Premier League."
Ross has only three years' experience in driving, after a period when he was assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of the Hearts training staff.
Then helped the club Alloa come back after returning to division C and managed to save St. Mirren from the retrograde, helping the team win the championship title next season.
Ross said he feels better now than his entire career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a crucial moment," he said about taking over the leader of the Alloa club.
“I even thought that my role as manager was more fitting than the player.
Maybe it sounds weird, because I had a good time, I won well and I had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I face situations similar to manager's, in terms of stress and pressure, but I feel that it's the right role for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now, that I can do this, I feel it's the best thing I've ever had in my adult life."
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday, 30 September, between 12:00 and 13:00 at the Sports Sound show from Radio Scotland.
The ideal time to drink a half beer is Saturday at 17:30, according to a poll
The heat wave this summer led to an increase in revenue in the British pubs, but putting more pressure on the restaurants chains.
According to the figures, pubs and bars recorded a 2.7% increase in July, while restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, the representative of the CGA, who provides business advisory services and conducted the survey, said: “The constant heat and participation of England in the World Cup over a longer period than the proposed period contributed to a type in July, similar to that of the previous month, when the pubs registered up to 2.8% more customers, while the restaurants had a worse period.
The number of customers below 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June has decreased even more in July.
The pubs and bars that serve only drinks recorded a much larger profit than restaurants.
And the pubs that serve food recorded losses caused by heat, but not as large as restaurants.
Looks like people went out into town just to consume drinks.
Drink sales at the level of all bars and pubs increased by 6.6% this month, and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, a representative of the RSM company that provides hospitality services, said: “These results continue the trend that I have observed since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of sports and social events of scale remain among the most important factors contributing to the sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to record losses, although the decrease in sales by 4.8% year-olds will add to current cost pressures.
Canical summer can't come at a worse time for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including the new ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the small number of new locations launched.
The company that monitors the sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes the performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over 9 billion pounds, being the official industry standard.
One of the five children has a secret account on a socialization network he hides from his parents
According to one survey, one of five children, some even up to 11 years of age, has a secret account on a socialization network hidden by parents and teachers
A survey conducted at the level of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in Insta 'false accounts'
Knowledge has increased concerns about sexual content posts
20% of students said they had a "main" account shown to their parents
One of five children, some even up to 11 years of age, creates an account on a socialization network that keeps him hidden from adults.
A survey conducted on a number of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in Insta's false accounts, referring to the Instagram photo sharing platform.
Knowledge has increased the fear of sexual content posts.
20% of students said that they have a "main" and "clean" account that they show their parents, but that they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who mistakenly discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, observed the position of a teenager who asked to be "violated".
According to research conducted by the UK Digital Awareness Company and the Association of Directors (HMC – Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference) of independent schools, 40% of young people between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, and half of them have recognised that they have secret accounts.
HMC Association Director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers do not have access."
Elind Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Commission
Elind Doyle was elected as the Director, without executive power, of the Scottish Athletics Commission, at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated field and track athlete in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for those who make decisions about sports activities to benefit from the vast experience it has gained at international level over the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys respect for the entire community of athletes in Scotland, the UK, as well as the whole world and we are sure that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits once they are included in the commission," Beattie said.
Doyle also said: "I am glad that I can represent athletes and hope to have a real contribution and be able to help how sports activities take place in Scotland."
The American nationality athlete, who won 200 and 400 meters of evidence at the 1996 Atlanta Games, along with the four gold medals won at the Olympic Games, is now a frequent commentator at the BBC, remains invalid after he suffered a transient ischemic attack.
It says on Twitter: “After a month, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will decide whether or not I will recover.
It was a Titanic job, but I recovered completely, I learned to go again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
A breast pump advertising that compares women to cows divides public opinion online
A company producing breast pumps has caused the division of public opinion in the online environment with an ad that compares mothers who breast-feed with the mutilation of cows.
To mark the launch of a pump that wants to be "the first silent and portable breast pump in the world", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic advertisement, inspired by a music video clip, to present the freedom the new pump offers to breast-feeding mothers.
Four true mothers dance in a cattle-filled barn on a melody that includes verses such as: "Yes, I'm soft, but I don't have a tail" and "if you haven't noticed, they're not sore, they're my breasts."
The report goes on to say: "Bobs, pump, pump, pump, pump, pull milk from girls."
However, the complaint, published on the company's Facebook page, raised controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 visualizations and hundreds of comments, the video was aimed at mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of them stating that it takes the "orori" out of the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and be born to produce milk, except because they are stolen from their children only a few days after birth," one person wrote.

Another commented: “It is understandable how traumatic it is for both mother and child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "A highly inappropriate advertising."
Other people have defended the claim, one person claiming that it seemed to him as a "hilar."
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd have bought one if I was still breast-feeding.
The pump really made me feel like a witch.
The ad is a little inappropriate, but I took it like that.
But the product is great," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny advertisement that targets mothers who use the pump (desserts at work or in toilets) and who feel like “the bugs”.
It's not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they danced with discreet pumps introduced into the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use breast pump say they feel like vices.
But Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly in a breast support, offering women freedom of movement, the possibility of holding children in their arms and even going out into the city while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and developer in design at Mother commented: “Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and provocative launch.
Comparing mothers who breast-feeding and milk cows, we wanted to highlight what the use of a breast pump and the challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump will give.
It's not the first time Elvie's pump gets on the first page.
During the presentation of fashion creator Marta Jakubowski at the London Fashion Week, on the podium, the mother of two children appeared while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly transferred to a refugee camp from the border with Texas
The number of children detained migrants has increased, although the number of people who have crossed the border each month has remained relatively the same, largely because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by Trump administration have led to the acceleration of the child placement procedure in sponsors.
Many sponsors are themselves non-documented immigrants and are afraid that they will be in danger of staying in the country if they ask to take children.
The risks increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, should register their prints and that their data will be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior customs and immigration officer, told Congress that the agency had arrested ten people who had requested the sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous penalties.
"Approximately 80% of those who are sponsors or members of the sponsor's family live illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreign offenders.
Which means we will continue to look for those individuals," Albence said.
In order to speed up the process in the child system, the authorities have introduced new rules according to which children must be present in court at a month of detention, and not at 60 days as provided for by the previous standard, according to the shelter employees.
Many will plead for the case through a video call, not personally in front of an immigration judge, to request the status of legal resident.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they can become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or escape attempts, according to the system’s shelters and reports in recent months.
Lawyers have said that these concerns are accentuated to a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility of signs indicating that a child has problems are not observed, due to the size of the unit.
They added that the transfer of children to refugee camps without providing them enough time for emotional preparation or to take advantage of friends could cause them trauma, many of which are already suffering.
Syria calls for US, French and Turkish military forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem asked Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria is in war for eight years.
Mouleem, who is also the interim prime minister, said that foreign military forces are located in a Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that "the situation will be adequately managed".
"This must be withdrawn immediately and without any condition," he said at the meeting.
Moualem stressed that "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died from the year 2011, and millions of people were distraught from their homes.
He further stated that Damascus will continue "this sacred battle until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories".
There are approximately 2,000 military troops in Syria in the United States, which are particularly involved in training and consulting the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
There are also more than 1,000 French military troops in the war-spoiled country.
With regard to the refugee problem, Moualem said there are conditions for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "dispersing Iraqi fears", which led refugees to stay away.
It added: "I have requested the support of the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return".
"Political influences are brought into a problem that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the war's end.
United Nations diplomats say that a recently concluded agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to extend the last group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement contributed to the avoidance of a large-scale assault by the Syrian forces, supported by the Russians, on the province in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that the military action will target the jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which have links to the Al-Qaeda network and which will "be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy, Staff of Mixture, hopes to meet soon at the first meeting of a new committee formed by government members and opposition to the drafting of a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the area for elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the activities of the committee should be limited to "revision of the current constitution" and issued an intervention warning.
Why will Trump win second term
If we were to take this logic, Trump would be real in 2020, unless the replacement procedure or scandals would end his mandate as president earlier, which most of the liberal hearings hope to happen.
In this case, it would no doubt be "the most dramatic end of a presidential mandate at all times!"
Until now, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, first-time audits have doubled to CNN, reaching 1.05 million and nearly tripled to MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, the TV station Fox News has been tracking, on average, 2.4 million people over the past four years when it was followed by 1.7 million, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" from MSNBC has recorded an audience record, with 3.5 million people who have followed it in the series in which important news was broadcast.
"This is a subject that attracts the public, because we cannot understand it," said Neal Baer, the producer of the ABC's dramatic series "Chairman of Reserve", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and the book 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club' has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip through Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote with Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, 'For making me laugh,' said Scovell.
In chaos, entertainment is being valued.
Of course, unlike anything else broadcast on TV, the action taken in Washington could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if the families of immigrants can also be whole about the state of the global economy.
Exchange of post is a luxury that can only be allowed by the privileged public.
However, you are not only an informed citizen when you arrive at the sixth hour of debate by an expert committee of how Bob Woodward uses deep background sources for his book, Fair, about Paul Manafort's $15,000-skin jacket ("an object of opposing clothing", according to The Washington Post) and the implications of the shocking descriptions of Stormy Daniels' "anatomical parts" of Trump's actress.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario in the same way.
"A large part of what makes you feel like looking at a reality show and feeding you with subjects every night," said Brent Montgomery, the executive director of the media group Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the show "Ass of Amanette", about the constantly changing distribution and the daily turmoil caused by Trump (launching a competition with a professional football league, the praise given to Kim Jong-Un).
Don't let you lose an episode, because you'll feel you're behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week in his home from the northern part of the Kauai island, there were 27 degrees outside and there was the sun, and he was sitting inside looking at MSNBC and recording from CNN.
It could not be disbanded from the television, especially while Brett Kavanaugh was going to face the Senate's legal commission and had to decide on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember doing some shows out of the ordinary in the past, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they seemed to be right."

Complementary external financial resources for the tightest intermediate elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realisation of electoral districts, which resulted in two holders of the mandate in an electoral course for the same function, it is not at all surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania enjoys comprehensive financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of Pittsburg has brought the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won, in another district, the special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another mandate holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania, which overlaps significantly with the 17th.
Election cards were reconfigured after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were not constitutional and that the boundaries of the districts were manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The course of the 17th new electoral district launched a competition in funding campaigns between major party funding agencies, the Congress Committee for the Campaign of Democrats (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election, which took place in March for the 18th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania.
For over a decade the function was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won this district with a 20-point difference.
According to political commentators, democracies enjoy an easy advantage.
The United States took into account the criminalization of El Salvador on the basis of its understanding with China, but then abandoned
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a meeting with the President of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until partners evacuated the Trump leadership team.
The State Department officials decided to call the American leaders of the diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of "the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the spokesman of the department in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions against the State of El Salvador were considered, which received US aid worth approximately $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial assistance and visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and the high rate of unemployment and its crimes.
As internal meetings have progressed, North American and Central American officials have delayed a high-level conference, focused on economic security and prosperity, to continue a similar meeting last year, considering a step forward in preventing migrants from being directed to the United States.
But by mid-September, the officials in front of the administration made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively ending any examination of the sanctions for El Salvador.
It is now planned for Vice-President Mike Pence to address the conference, scheduled in mid-October, seeking to highlight the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A spokesman of the White House for John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they were kept anonymous.
Their reports have been corroborated by an external analyst, who is an approach to the administration and who has also spoken on condition that the anonymity is kept.
History study
The next thing that might happen is the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, about which there are now strong public evidence.
It also appears that Mueller is directing his investigation and investigation into the existence of a plot between Trump and Russia in relation to the attack on the US elections.
Should the Congress change, Trump will face the appropriate responsibility within the body, even when he is prepared to present himself before the electors and, if possible, a jury formed by his colleagues.
There are many possible situations and I do not want to suggest that Trump's "fall" is inevitable, and it is also valid for his homologies in Europe.
There are elections that we all have to make on one side and on the other side of the Atlantic which will decide the duration of the investigation.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to give a coup against Hitler only if the West was opposed and supported by the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
I failed and lost such an opportunity to avoid the massacre years that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing some of these critical moments right now.
What will we do if Trump resigns Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since he reported in this newspaper last year that he suggested the President's secret registration and speculated about his incompatibility with the role of president.
Rosenstein said the Times report was wrong.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Research Office regarding Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed at the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that will shoot Trump in charge?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, after the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew of Czechoslovakian origin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
He survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, he sent me to light up Saturday's candles on the table with the zodiac.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Player Graham Dorrans from the Rangers team is optimistic about the game with Rapid Vienna
Joi, Rangers will be the host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that the victory in the match with the Austrians, after the impressive equality in Spain against the Villarreal team from the beginning of the month, will put it in a strong position to qualify as a Group G of the European League.
An accident on the knees did not allow middleman Graham Dorrans to play in this season until 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers team can use this result in its advantage to achieve better performance.
"It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team," said the player aged 31.
"We started the game thinking we'll get a good result and we won a point.
Maybe we could have written down at the end, but, in total, I think the equation was a correct result.
I think they were better at first replay, and we noticed better at the second.
Joi, it'll be an important evening for Europe again.
With little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they have had a good result in the last game played. However, with the support of the supporters, we will certainly feel and more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, taking into account my accidents and changes from the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is good and the boys really like to be here; training also goes well.
Let's hope we're going to endure, we're going to leave the past season behind, and we're going to have good results."
Women have insomnia due to pension economies
Despite the fact that participants in the survey knew clearly how to be concerned, few people talked to family members about this.
Approximately half of those who participated in the study conducted by the Nationwide company said that they discussed the long-term cost of care with their spouse.
Only 10% of them said they talked to their children about this subject.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but don't initiate this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Company.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to give you the care you need if you do not make your wishes known from time to time.
You work with the councillor and the family to discuss the place and how you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor for determining costs.
Involve the financial advisor: and the financial advisor can be a real help with regard to the payment of these expenditures.
Your long-term funding choices can include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy in cash, to help you cover these expenses or to ensure your own well-being – to the extent you have the money.
Put yourself in line with legal documents: come into the process of legal problems.
Get an authorization on medical decisions, to designate a trusted person to monitor your medical care and to ensure that professionals in the field respect your wishes if you cannot communicate with them.
Consider, too, the implementation of a mandate on your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that you have the facts, if you do not have the ability to do so.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that a parent of yours with an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you respond to questions about his medicines and allergies?
Note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"And it's not all just about the financial side. Can you tell who the doctors are taking care of it?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who will take care of his dog?
Draw up a plan on all these things."
A man was shot several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a compressed air rifle while going to the house after a night spent in the city.
The victim, at the age of 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 02:30, as "accursed shootings".
The victim couldn't see his attacker.
The wounded don't put his life in danger, and the police have called on witnesses to make statements.
Disasters and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died from a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, according to the authorities, and the number of deaths is expected to rise.
Due to the interruption of the communications networks, the disaster management authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala region, an area north of the city of Palu, which is close to the epicenter of the disaster with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key information about Palu and Dongala, from the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of the centre of the island of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow golf course on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated 40 years of existence when it was hit by tsunamis and earthquakes.
Dongala is a kingdom that extends to a coast of more than 300 km north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, an administrative region located below a province, has a population of about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture activities are the central point of the province's economy in the centre of the island of Sulawesi, in particular in the coastal region of Dongala.
Mining activities for the extraction of nickel are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesia Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Also in 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of the Dongala Regency, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Circle, an area with intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the disasters and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of the island of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half being from Aceh.
2005: a series of strong storms hit the west coast of the island of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along the island of Sumatra.
2006: a 6.8-degree earthquake on the Richter scale struck the southernmost Indonesian island, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: a 7.6-degree earthquake on the Richter scale took place near the town of Padang, the capital of the province of Sumatra de West.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: a 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale struck one of the Mentawai islands along the coast of the island of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres, which destroyed ten villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: a low intensity earthquake occurred in the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing damage and panic, as people remembered the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004, which fought with a large number of deaths.
This time a tsunami didn't start, but more than 100 people died because of broken buildings.
2018: several major storms took place on the tourist island Lombok, causing the death of more than 500 people, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists remained temporarily blocked under damage.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and the candidate for the post of vice president, Sarah Palin, was arrested following allegations of violence.
Palin, aged 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under the suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence claim and in opposition to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the Alaskan state police.
According to the police report, when a knowledge of this female woman tried to call the police to claim the alleged crimes, she took her phone.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su unit, awaiting the trial, and is held on the basis of a bail-free bank, worth $500, according to the KTUU.
It was presented on Saturday in court, where "100% innocent" was declared when it was requested by the network.
Palin faces three charges of Class A offences, which means he could be imprisoned for a period of up to a year and adjourned with $250,000.
They have also been charged with a Class B offence, which is punishable by a day in prison and an amendment of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin's been charged with such charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce alleged aggression.
The case is being brought before the Alaska Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, involving a claim of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was in a state of drunkenness in connection with an incident.
According to his lover's statement, she gave him a punch in front of him.
Sarah Palin was criticized by the veteran groups in 2016 after her son’s violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffered after being part of the military forces in Iraq.
Cutremur and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead people
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are broken down and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The disaster occurred along the central province of Sulawesi, which is located in the north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On socialization networks, video clips are circulating that present the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
The federal prosecution wants a capital punishment for the suspect terrorist attack in New York City
The New York federal prosecution wants a capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City after which eight people were killed, a rare sentence that was no longer applied in the state for a 1953 federal crime.
It appears that Saipov, at the age of 30, used a hired Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a West Side motorway, from the Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on his journey in October.
In order to justify capital punishment, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov has "intendedly killed" the eight victims and caused "intendedly" serious bodily injuries, according to the intentional opinion on the request for capital punishment, filed in the South District of New York.
Both accused parties may receive a capital sentence, according to the court's document.
In a few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury accused Saipov of 22 counts of charges involving eight counts of crime in support of organised crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required substantial "planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed the act as "hate, cruel and debased".
“Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, suffering and loss to families and friends of the following persons: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco”, according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the last trial of a case of capital punishment in the South District of New York.
The priest, Khalid Barnes, was accused of murdering two drug dealers, but eventually was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a New York federal case took place in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after being convicted of conspiracy at the Soviet Union espionage committee during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Rosenberg's wives were executed on the electric seat on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regret in the days and months following the attack.
He testified to the investigators that he liked what he did, according to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after looking at the videos of the ISIS group on his phone, as requested.
Also, according to the police, he asked to drill the ISIS flag into the hospital room.
He pretended innocent about the 22 counts of charges.
David Patton, one of the defenders in the office who represented Saipov, said that they are "evidently disappointed" of the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply the capital punishment, rather than accepting a life imprisonment plea, without any possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team previously asked the prosecutors not to apply the capital punishment.
A member of Parliament who is part of the Conservative Party argues that NIGEL FARAGE must be at the forefront of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today that he would "mobilize the civilian army", during a protest at the Conservative Party's conference.
Ukip's former leader said politicians should "sigh pressure" from Eurosceptics, following the statement of a member of Parliament Theresei May who suggested that it should be in the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Party, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be out" until now if Farage was secretary in the Brexit campaign.
However, the challenge that May faces in terms of the extremely divided camps was accentuated by the members of the Conservative Party who joined another protest, against the European Union's entry into the city.
The Prime Minister seeks to ensure that his compromise plan, called the Chequers plan, is properly carried out, facing the attacks of those who support leaving the European Union, those who want to remain in it, as well as the European Union.
The alliances have stressed that it will continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and will force the Eurosceptics and the Labourist Party to choose between its offer and its 'haos'.
Bone said in the event of the pro-Brexit move "Leave Means Leave" in Solihull that he wants "renunciation of the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and be given the associated responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If things were led by him, I was no longer in the European Union," he said.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, the representative of the Wellingborough constituency, added: "I support Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers plan."
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: "I have not fought in world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the suggestions for changing public opinion to the 2016 vote: "It is not true that the British have reconsidered and want to remain in the Union."
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: "I just want to say so: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voices of people.
"The public does not agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with it and neither our activists who go out and support us, first of all, in the elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message aimed at Theresa May, it added: "The prime ministers who keep their function are those who respect their promises."
As part of the meeting, Nigel Farage said that politicians should be in a position to "sigh pressure" if they are about to give up the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"He's trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them "we won't let them do this."
In a message sent to the enthusiastic thanks, he added: “You want to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
"We mobilize the civilian army of the country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who support the stay in the European Union marched through Birmingham two hours before a meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised a ban on "The Conservative Party is against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the members of the Conservative Party and the security problems they faced in applying the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for digitising customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a farce.
Brexit doesn't bring any benefits," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously about running for the presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said he would seriously consider running for the presidency after the November elections.
According to Boston Globe, the Democratic Senator of Massachusetts spoke on Saturday about her future during a summit in the Western state of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for the November elections against Geoff Diehl, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of the Republican Party, who was co-chair of the 2016 Donald Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was in the centre of speculation that Trump could win in 2020.
The event from Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was a meeting with number 36 with citizens with the right to vote using the format of the primacy since Trump took over the presidency.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come for "women to reach Washington to solve the problems of our seriously affected government, and this included finding a woman in his face."
A suspect has been arrested in the event of death causing the death of Sims from the LSU team
The Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the event of a death that caused the death of LSU's Wayde Sims basketball player Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They published a video material at the time of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man in the images.
Sims, at the age of 20, was shot and killed near the campus at Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday for 247 sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was at the scene, that he was in possession of a weapon, but also that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken to police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a junior player, with a height of 1.98 m, who grew in Baton Rouge, played in 32 matches, being 10 times in the original batch in the last season and playing on average 17.4 minutes with 5.6 points and 2.9 matches.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after the team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time that Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team will play an essential role in the process.
Based on the first position in the ranking, Bottas had a good start and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two tours and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop the box and leave Hamilton at the group's tail, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes stopped at the box later and came from behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to advance after a few schemes that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior free after making a double move to defend himself at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the race in the back of the chariot and was in the seventh place near the end of the first tour, even on the day he was 21 years old.
Then he stood in front of a large part of the race, looking at a quick finish and trying to beat Kimi Raikkonen and take the four.
Finally, he stopped at the 44th tour box, but couldn't increase the pace in the last eight tours, Raikkonen remaining in the fourth place.
“It was a difficult day. Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and acted like a true gentleman, letting me go ahead.
And the team did an excellent job to gain victory in front of the Ferraris and to achieve this double," Hamilton said.
A terrible body language
President Donald Trump ironed Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday, in a meeting on the subject of his insistences, as she did not facilitate Christine Blasey Ford's letters, which accused Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court, of sexual aggression.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are "living, immoral and lying".
"The only thing that could happen is the beautiful thing that happens in the last days in the Senate, when you see the hand, when you see people who are angry and evil and immoral and lying," he said.
“When you see that they published and published information and then say that they did not.
They're not the responsible ones.
Do you remember?
When did I ask Diane Feinstein if she made it easier for her to delete the document?
Do you remember her answer?
Uh... no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
No, I didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent to the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "suffered" in September, but Feinstein denied that "suffering" occurred in her office.
"I haven't hidden the accusations about Ford and I'm not the one that made it easier to "get rid of" her relationship," Feinstein told the committee, according to Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep the confidentiality and that's exactly what I did."
Her denial, however, did not seem to be well - received by the president, who commented during the Saturday meeting: “If I am honest, it was a horrible body language.
Maybe she didn't, but she was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that democracies use accusations to achieve their own ends.
"They are determined to take power in any way possible.
Observe the wickedness, immorality, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to destroy to get power and control," the president said, according to the Mediate website.
Elite League: the Star team in Dundee wins with 5-3 in front of the Giants team in Belfast
Patrick Dwyer wrote two goals for Giants against the Dundee team
The Stars team in Dundee paid for losing Fridays in the Elite League, winning before the Giants in Belfast in the back game on Saturday, with a score of 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants team had an advance of two goals, the hits being executed by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equaled the score before Dwyer brought Giants back in front of the opponent team.
Francois Bouchard equaled the score for Dundee before two goals marked by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen to ensure their victory.
It was the third defeat of the elite League of this season for the players of Adam Keefe, who recovers the ground by winning the team from Dundee on 2-1 Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams, Giants winning the last three matches.
Dwyer's opening show was launched in the fourth minute, 3:35, respectively, from a Kendall McFaul pass, then David Rutherford passed decisively to Beauvillelier who doubled the team's advantage four minutes later.
In a game that started so dynamic, Sullivan set up the host team in 13:10, before Matt Marquardt offered Cownie the opportunity to record for an equal score in 15:16.
Dwyer secured the advantage of the Giants team before the first break, when he signed up his second goal at the end of the first break.
The host team broke up and Bouchard re-equipped with an impressive goal in a minute 27:37.
Later, in the replay of the second, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen gain an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that match, thus ensuring that the team went to 5th place in the class, at the half of the last replay.
The Giants team, who has now lost four of the last five matches, will be, Friday, host to Milton Keynes in their next match.
An air traffic controller died after ensuring the decommissioning of a plane with hundreds of passengers during a disaster
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero, dying after ensuring the safe decommissioning of an aircraft with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after a strong earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There have been several powerful replicas in the area and many people are locked under the rest of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, Antonius Gunavan Agung, at the age of 21, refused to leave his post from the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu, which had a strong wake.
It remained in place to ensure that flight 6321 of the Batik Air, which is on the track at that time, would be safely disembarked.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed he was about to crash.
He died at the hospital later.
The spokesman for the Indonesian air navigation service provider said that it is possible to save hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We have prepared a helicopter to transport it from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We are suffering from this news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the national disaster management agency stating that access is limited in the towns of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe that the number will increase, as many victims are still under ruin and we have not had access to many of them," said the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The valleys with a height of up to six meters devastated the city of Palu, on Sunday to have a common funeral.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings victims.
It's almost impossible to find drinking water.
All the minimarkets are stolen."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is fast offering help to survivors, but we do not know what they will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: "Please work day and night to carry out all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?", CNN announced.
Indonesia was shaken at the beginning of this year's riot in Lombok, which fought with more than 550 deaths.
Avian accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a person is missing after a plane crashed in a lagoon
The airline holding the plane that crashed into a Pacific Ocean lake in Micronesia now declared that a person was missing, after previously declared that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that crashed.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger is missing from the afternoon of Saturday.
He also mentioned that he is trying to find the man, along with the local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to recover the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, the authorities said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of the events.
The airline and the United States Naval Forces said the plane missed the landing track and arrived at a lake next to it.
Some witnesses think the plane was over the end of the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very small distance from the ground.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which reached the bridge, and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the shipmates panicked and shouted and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The United States Naval Forces said that the mariners who were working close to renovating a ship jumped in aid, using a flammable boat to transport people to the shore before the plane sinks to 30 meters below the water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people died in accidents by air companies registered in PNG over the last two decades, but none of them included an Air Niguini aircraft.
An analyst presents the time of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution closed its proceedings with regard to the resumption of the trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the United States Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used his mobile phone records to put Quinton Tellis' actions to the head, at the age of 29, as well as those of his victim Jessica Chambers, at the age of 19, on the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he was killed, this being in contradiction with his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called in the witness box and testified he wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "was lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicate that they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that, shortly after Chambers died, Tellis deleted the text messages, calls and contact details of Chambers from his phone.
"Deleted her from his life," Hale said.
According to the schedule, the defense will begin its final prayer Sunday.
The judge said he was suggesting that the jury would decide at the end of that day.
The High Breed: what is the hip-hop conscious?
A trio that sings hip-hop music wants to change the negative way that this kind of music is seen, with the help of positive tunes.
The High Breed Corps, from Bristol, argues that the hip-hop has stopped transmitting political messages and addressing social problems as it did initially.
They want to return to origins and make hip-hop conscious to be popular again.
A recent rebirth of artists such as The Fugees and Commons in the United Kingdom was observed through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another color person?!
A New York judge gives a couple a ruling that they fired her after she received a text message "racist"
A New Yorker judges a couple for the granting of discrimination on grounds of discrimination after she has received a text message from her mother, complaining that it was "a person of color".
The couple denied that they were racist, claiming that she had given them in court for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her disappointment when she learned that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was colorful when she presented herself on the first day of work in 2016.
"NUUUUUUUUUU! IN A MAN OF COURSE", wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After she realized that she felt embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the gift, which is African-American, had not fulfilled her duties properly and that she was expected to receive a gift of Filipino nationality, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for the day of work and sent home with Uber.
Now, she judges the couple to pay compensation for the concession and requests the amount of $350 per day for six months, the period in which she was to live with them and carry out her activity, despite the fact that this was done without a contract concluded.
"I want to show them that they don't do such things," she said Friday for the Post newspaper, adding "I know it's discrimination".
The couple denied the claims about being racist, saying it was a normal thing to fire Maurice, because they were afraid that they could no longer trust her after they hurt her.
"My sister sent her a wrong message.
She's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco, his husband, for the Post newspaper.
"But would you leave the children on the hands of a person to whom you have made a mistake, even if it was wrong?
The newborn child?
Let's be serious."
Considering the process as an action of "extortion", Plasco said that his wife will be born in two months and that she is in a "very difficult situation".
“Do you really want to avenge a person under such circumstances?
It doesn't do that," the bank investor added.
While the process is ongoing, the public opinion has accused the couple of socialization networks, judging them for the behavior and logic they have proved.
The editors of Paddington's story feared that readers would not be able to identify themselves with a bear speaking, according to a new letter.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said the following about the letter: “It’s hard to get into the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It's very funny now, after I saw that Paddington had a huge success."
He also said that his father, who was a cameraman for BBC before being inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, would be optimistic about the rejection of his work, adding that the anniversary of the 60-year anniversary of the publication of books was a "loving-loving" after he died last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father had a discreet pride about the success she later enjoyed.
"He was a pretty quiet man and didn't like to praise," she said.
“And because Paddington was so real to him, it was like he had a child who had a success: you’re proud of him, though it’s not yours.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to give him the merit of Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to take my phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nisa, where the doctors tried to save her life in the dark.
"It often calls to tell me it's very serious and doesn't think it will survive," Ednan-Laperous said.
"Then I received a call from Nad telling me that he will die in the next two minutes and that I must take the rest of it
And that's exactly what I did.
I said to him, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medicines used to keep her heart pumping blood began to decrease and get out of her body.
Dead a little while ago and the organs began to fail.
I was forced to stay there and wait, aware of everything that's happening.
I couldn't scream or shout because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself."
Eventually, Ednan-Laperous, being in mourning after his daughter's death, boarded the plane, along with other passengers, who did not know what he was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
“I held my head down and tears did not stop running.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had a overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I realized he needed love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Two pregnant women place various messages on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones because they killed themselves trying to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in the Gali Country, many of which are motivated and include phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Sharon Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45 years old, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising cook with a mollusk smile.
"Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said his smile would change your mood."
However, he gave up his job before he died, because he arrived at a very unfortunate moment in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after he took his life.
Davis said: "I still think you will have a domino effect."
It created the messages “to tell people that I can call someone or that I can talk to someone, even with a friend.
Exterior yourself, you need to talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' friend for many years, lost Mark, the life partner he had for 15 years, at little time since his mother's death.
"He didn't tell me he's not feeling well or he's depressed," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that his attitude changed.
She was in a deplorable state on Christmas, when the children took off their gifts and didn't even look into her eyes."
She said that her death was a terrible trauma to them, but she had to overcome it: “She caused a terrible pain within the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to go further and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as a result of the start of the investigation by the Federal Research Office
"I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked – an investigation into a limited and limited period of time – we could have a little unity," Jeff Flake said Saturday, adding that he is afraid that the commission is about to "disintegrate", at the bottom of a partial blockade.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reticence is entirely due to the time factor.
There are only five weeks before the November 6 elections - if, as suggested, the Republicans have bad results, their attempts to place the one they want the winner of the elections for the highest court in the country will be significantly weak.
George W. Bush kept calling the senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI finalizes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear if Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to make the difference in the case of equality and confirm it at the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees falls under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean MP said.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korea unification ministry, said last year they fled the country about 1,127 people, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the key factors were more severe border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates perceived by those transporting illegal persons across the border.
The Phenian didn't make any public comments.
A large majority of North refugees are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
The Seoul officials declare that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the illegal border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of the refugees across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two sides of Korea.
China considers refugees rather illegal migrants than refugees and often repatriates them.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still, in practice, in the war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met at Phenian for a few discussions that had been the subject of negotiations on denuclearisation.
This took place after the historic meeting between American presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong-one in Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to cooperate for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US sanctions of missing progress ever since.
"If we cannot trust the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security and, in such situations, in no case will we be the first to be disarmed unilaterally," Ri said in a speech addressed to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "steric", saying he is unable to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court as "steric" and said that his temper was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made comments on Saturday during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't imagine that if there was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared "herdic," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate's legal committee, which took place on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the charges that Christine Blasey Ford was sexually assaulted when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screamed and lost his voice because of his emotions, while discussing his family and the years of high school.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats in the commission, calling charges against him "a grotesque and coordinated murder", organised by the angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said it is of the opinion that Kavanaugh's testimony has shown that he cannot serve at the Supreme Court, because he has shown that he is a partisan against the democrats.
"I believe it is declassified by those statements and by the way he attacked Clinton's family and democracies," she said.
Pelosi turned from the subject when he was asked if he would try to suspend Kavanaugh if it was confirmed and whether the democracies would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I just want to say this: if you don't tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate, not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which it is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Columbia District Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, he is concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh against the Law which is accessible to the care or the Roe versus Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be reversed.
"It's not the right time to go to court and wait for us to say "woe! what a wonderful person!" said Pelosi.
And women must be able to handle it.
It's a justified diagnosis, it's months and years of accumulated anger and it can't talk without crying out.
"We cry when we get angry," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, right?"
She continued: “I received a significant help from a woman who has an executive function, who told me that she was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique that, when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to: “You might think I’m sad because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then keep going.
I thought it was a great thing."
The tears are allowed for the outside of anger, partly because they are fundamentally wrong.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a man-dominated office, where I began to cry because of an inexplicable rage, is that I was caught by the head of an older woman, a cold director to whom I always felt a bit afraid, and took me to the house of the stairs.
"She must never see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be glad they caused you this feeling."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in Congress in Colorado State, worked with Gary Hart at the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Hart was arrested for having an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought he had no reason not to run for the presidency.
"It wasn't a very well thought-out decision," she says laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone referred to the situation as "White as the White and the seven little ones".
Because the campaign was at the end, she was behind the fundraising and swore she wouldn't get in the race if she couldn't get 2 million dollars.
It was a lost fight.
He found out that some of her supporters who gave the men $1,000, they only gave them $250.
"Do they think I'm getting reductions?" she asked.
During the speech he announced that he would not officially launch a company, it was so affected by emotions – as a result of the recognition for the people who supported it, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, but also the anger caused by gender discrimination – that he lost his voice because of the emotions .
"You would have said I have a nervous crisis," Schroeder recalls about the press reactions to her.
"You would have said one of my sponsors is Kleinex."
I remember thinking about what they're going to write on my funeral rock.
"And the complaint?"
How can the commercial war between the United States and China benefit Beijing?
Savings that announced the beginning of a trade war between the United States and China were absurd and, although there seems to be a long way to its conclusion, disputes between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, first issued a warning at the beginning of this year by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar, steel and aluminium panels.
The most important escalation has taken place this week with new taxes, which have affected products worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds sterling), applying, in effect, taxes for half of all goods in China arriving in the United States.
Beijing has avenged itself on every occasion, most recently imposing a fee of between 5 and 10% for American products worth $60 billion.
China has warned that it will respond to each hit from the United States and is unlikely to make the world's second largest economy a step back in the near future.
In order for Washington to withdraw, China must agree with its requests, but public surrender to the United States would be too humiliating for Xi Jinping, Chinese President.
However, experts say that, if Beijing is playing its books well, the US trade war pressure could favour China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would be in fact more dangerous than what has been proposed so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a group of experts.
Syria is ready to return refugees, Foreign Minister declares
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by a war that lasts for better than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's situation is improving.
"Today, conditions on the ground are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made to combat terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to bring things back to normal.
Existing conditions allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country since 2011, when the war broke out.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be pleased to receive help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsored by the Insurgency would not be accepted.
European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder 2018 Cup after winning the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National from the edge of Paris, France.
The United States now recorded the sixth consecutive victory in Europe and no longer won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe returned first after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team got 14,5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who made incredible efforts in most of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial hit in the water to the wall 3 from the 16th, giving it to Francesco Molinari's match.
The Italian golfer Molinari has had an incredible performance in all the reruns, becoming one of the four players with a result of 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, from 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5th and 4th holes in front of the player from the last place in the ranking of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen in Denmark.
The first player in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 holes in front of Ian Poulter in England, which is probably his last match in Ryder's cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, who participated in eight editions, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the European player with the most winnings, recording an average of 25.5 points in his entire career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm extremely happy that I could win the cup again.
It's a team job and I'm glad I could be of help," Garcia said, excitedly, after the European victory.
It teaches his countryman, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at holes 2 and 1, at the individual game Sunday.
"I'm very proud that I beat Tiger Woods. I used to follow the games when I was a kid," Rahm, 23 years old, said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 at Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 important titles, being surpassed only by Jack Nicklus.
All weekend, the American team put a real effort into the golf course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played extraordinaryly throughout the tournament.
The captain of the American team, Jim Furyk, said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of them, they have even tried.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I've gone to a battle of wormholes.
Down the hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
I will work with the PGA of America and our Committee for the Ryder Cup and we will go further.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We must give them due respect.
They played better than us."
