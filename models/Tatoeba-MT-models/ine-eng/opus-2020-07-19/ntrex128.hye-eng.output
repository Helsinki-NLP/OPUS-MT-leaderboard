The Welsian Assemblies were concerned that they would be seen as "skinned"
Some of the Assemblies are afraid of the MWPs (member of Wells' Council) proposal for change.
This proposal was due to a change of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The Assemblies are concerned that in the political field, it can be a joke.
One of the employees in Assemble said his group was undressed because "the name is Twp and Pwp."
For the readers out of Welse, the Welsh Twp means crazy, and the pwp is a joke.
One of the members of the Plaid Cymru Association in Assemble says that the group "is not happy" and offered options.
Another Welsh guard says that his group is "different" about the revolution, but he says that the conversion of the pancakes from the Welsh Parliament was a short flight of verbal thought.
In this context, the Welsh w (dablu) is expressed as the English letter u (u) in Yorkshire.
The Assembly of Assemblies, which is currently about to present the legislation on the reform, said: "The final decision on any natural name of the members of Assemble must of course be the work of the members.
The Wels government granted the power to change its name in Act 2017.
In June, the Conference published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which received great support for the name of the Assembly, the Welsh Parliament.
The Assembly supported the members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP on the name of the Assembly (AMs), but the MWP received the largest support from the business council.
Apparently, the members of the Assembly are proposing alternatives, but the struggle to reach agreement can become the main priority for the president, Ellie Jones, who will probably present the draft regulation on change within a few weeks.
The legislation on legal changes will also include other changes to the working class of the Assembly, including the rules on membership of the Assembly and the structure of the mission system.
Members of the Assembly will have a final vote on how to decide when the legislation is discussed.
Macedonians began questioning the Incident to Change the Name of the Earth
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country: "The Republic of North Macedonia."
This famous vote was intended to resolve the ten-year dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its state on behalf of Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbour's name is a requirement for its territory, and has repeatedly addressed the EM and NATO for membership.
President Georgi Ivanov of Macedonia, the anti-revolutionist president, said he would declare the vote cancelled.
In any case, the community's supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zawey, argue that the revolution is just a reward for joining the US and NATO.
Until the tension between the churches began in Harlem, St. Martin's calls were silenced.
-The adults I spoke to say that, historically, there was a coffee shop and a church in every corner -- Mr. Adams said.
–There's none of them today.
He said that the disappearance of the heaters was understandable.
"People in our time are interacting in different ways," he said.
The heating is no longer considered neighboring rooms, where people attend regularly.
As for the churches, he is concerned that the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
"The churches," he added, "may be replaced by the residential buildings of the constellations, filled with people who don't help the shrines that are around them.
- Most of the people who go into these buildings are going to be whitewashed, he said, and so they'll speed up the day when these churches get confused, because it's unlikely that most of these people who move into these neighborhoods will become members of these churches.
The two churches were built by the white church, before the Metropolitan community in 1870, to become the Black capital of Harlem, and ten years later, St. Martin was built.
In 1930, a real white Methodologist convention was released.
The convention of the Black Seas, which worshipped in the neighborhood, became the name of the building.
St. Martin was attracted by the Holy John Howard Johnson, who was the leader of the 125th-century Harlem's main street malls, and he was himself opposed to getting a job or encouraging black people.
The fire in 1939 was very damaging to the building, but since Father Johnson's smokers planned to rebuild it, they were assigned to get calls.
St. David Jones, the son of Father Johnson and the head of St. Martin's church, calls proudly "the calls of the poor."
The expert who made the calls in July called them "the cultural treasure" and "the transformable historical tool."
Michigan University expert Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the first call in the world to be played by black artist Dionysio A. Lind, who replaced the call in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr Merveder said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What happened around St. Martin's church in the last few months was a complicated story between the architects and the carpenters: some were brought by church leaders, some on the Episcopal theme.
The Congregation of Leaders, the Church Leader's Body, was concerned in July about the issue of "stirring to avoid spending," despite the fact that the Assembly was not involved in the process of releasing architects and capalars.
Some churches complained about the lack of transparency.
The fish in California injured a 13-year-old boy who was drowned in the water to catch a seashore
On the Sabbath, the shark was attacked and injured by a 13-year-old boy who was tempted to catch a seafarer on the opening day of the season in California, says an official report.
The attack took place until 7:00 a.m. near the Ensinitas Bacon.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV TV that he was having sex with his friends about half an hour in the morning when he heard the boy calling for help. He and the group were staring at the boy to help him get out of the water.
Hamel said that he thought it was just the feeling to catch the seashore, but then he realized that he was crying, "I've been bitten."
- I've been bitten.
His arm was completely broken, said Hamel, and he only noticed it when he got to the boy.
"I'm proud of everyone to get out of the water." "There's a fish in the water!" said Hamel.
The boy's plane was sent to a hospital in San Diego, Redie's childhood hospital, where his condition was estimated to be extremely severe.
The species of assaulted shark was unknown.
The lifeboat captain, Larry Gils, said that the shark had appeared in that area a few weeks ago, but it wasn't considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim was injured in the upper part of the object.
The officials closed the entrance to the Escinia coast for 48 hours from Casablanca Ponto to Swam for research and security.
Giles added that there are more than 135 species of sharks in that area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Seinsberger’s plans are incorporated into the British beauty market
Seinsber is engaged in Boots, Superdrag and Debenhams, with the beauty of the shopping malls, with the professional assistants.
As in Britain's beauty market, some 2.8 billion pounds of sterling, which continues to grow when its design and the sale of household items are in progress, large beauty halls will be tried into 11 country shops and more shops will be moved in the next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty was revealed when supermarkets began looking for ways to exploit the areas of television, microwaves and other household matters.
Seinsber said it would be doubled to its size by offering up to 3,000 items of beauty, including such items as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw:
The existing theories of L'Oreal, the Maybellin and Burt's Bees will also get a bigger burning area, as it is in the boots shops.
The supermarket also converts to the logic of its boutiques, so that most products are of plant origin, which is a growing demand for young buyers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop, which is a retail market for the Christmas Shop, will try the Congestion Store in the two Seinesbury shops, the first of which was opened last week in Creedon, South London, and the second of the last year, Shell, in the West, in Birmingham.
Internet shopping, and the transition to a local grocery store with a daily cut, means that supermarkets have a lot to do to convince people to visit them.
Seinsbury's chief executive director, Mike Cooper, noted that the trading points would be seen as having supermarkets, because the network of supermarkets is trying to fight against Aldi and Lidl, with more services and without food.
Seinsbery Argos's trading spot placed in hundreds of stores, also introduced a number of Habitats brand vision until two years ago, both of which, in his own words, strengthened the sale of food and made its acquisitions more profitable.
The past experience in the supermarket, its beauty and medical components, was unsuccessful.
In the beginning of 2000, Seinesber tried to create a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended with a debate on how to divide the revenues from their supermarkets.
A new war was created three years ago, when Seinesber sold 125 million pounds of sterling to Selesio, who owned the Lloyds Pharmacy network.
It was expected that Lloyd would play a major role in this program by adding four shops to the brilliant concept of skin care, including such products as La Roche-Posay and Vichy:
We've transformed the look of our beauty halls and delivered another dinner, raising aesthetics for our customers.
We also made investments and we made special partners who would be able to advise.
Our vision of monsters is designed to meet every requirement, and the attractive environment, as well as the appropriate location, means that we are now a beautiful centre of beauty, which in turn is the old way to meet the challenges of buying.
Peter Jones is "crazy" after Holly Wilba's 11 million pounds of sterling business.
The Dragons Den TV star, Peter Jones, remained "crazy", when a TV broadcaster, Holly Wilby, came out of his life-style business to focus on his new terms with Marks&Spenser and ITV.
Wilbai didn't have time to do household clothes and things, Truly.
The couple's business was compared to the Guinean Peltroy Gup (Goop) market.
This morning, the 37-year-old constable announced that she was leaving.
Holly Wilby finally left the Dragons Den star with Peter Jones from a business that represented their way of life and focused on Marks&Spenser and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was "crazy" when the gold girl on the television, Tuesday, in Marlowe, at the headquarters of their business in Bukinghamshire, announced 1.5 million pounds of sterling and an extra business, which meant that he no longer had enough time to spend on his household clothes and affairs, Truly.
The business was compared to the Guinean Peltroy Goop market and was aimed at redoubled the 11 million pounds in Wilba's future.
When 37-year-old Wilbai announced in the Registry that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain and traveled to one of his summers.
The source says, "Truly was the top of Holly's priorities."
It's going to be his long future, which will protect him from seeing him in the next few decades.
His decision to go out, of course, left everyone alone.
No one could believe everything that was going on on Tuesday -- it was so close to action.
There's a warehouse in Marlo's head, ready to sell.
Experts are convinced that this morning's (This Morning) television show, which is considered one of Britain's richest stars, will cost millions for the company, from tops and candles to the horrendous investment of clothing and household affairs, as well as from subsequent operations.
And that could mean the end of a long-term company.
The mother of the three children of Wilbai and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Kup.
Wilbai founded Truly with Kapp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones became president in March.
Couples rest together, and Jones, Baldwin's firm, is the manager of 40 percent of the department.
Wilbai was about to become an M&S merchant's envoy and has to replace Annt McPartley as the ITV's "I'm the Star" (I'm A Celebrity) broadcaster.
Last night, Jones' close friends said, "We won't leave any comments on his business.
After a difficult conversation, “We fell in love with each other”
He was laughing at criticisms that would come to a press release for a comment that many would consider "no president" and that he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why does President Trampp give up so much?
The trumpeter said with the voice of a “narrator of events, ” who identified himself as a ridiculer:
- I didn't give up anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting, when, after their first meeting in Singapore in June, the Tromp took a major step forward in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the future were discussed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's highest biologist, Ri Young John, on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly, told the world leaders that the North does not see the "appropriate response" of the United States on the matter of North Korea's rapid military invasion.
Instead, he noted that the United States continues to apply sanctions to maintain targeted tensions.
The trumpet expressed a much more optimistic view in its speech.
- We have a great relationship with North Asia Korea.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have these wonderful relationships, he said.
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had positive results: the fire tests had been completed, helped to free foreign refugees, and finally the US military had returned home.
And he kept his unusual approach to talking about relationships with Kim.
- It's so easy to be president, but outside, instead of having 10,000 people trying to enter this filled area, we're going to have about 200 people standing right here -- the Tremp said, pointing to the crowd standing in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy the island, killing hundreds of lives
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations reported that they no longer needed it.
Despite the fact that 10 percent of the population of Lomboki had moved away, there was no national set-up that would be a precedent for international humanitarian aid.
- Unfortunately, in many cases, it's pretty clear that they're not going to ask for international help, so it's a little complicated, Mrs. Sambugg said.
But "Protecting Children" is a team that collects teams to travel to Palu, yet not so sure that foreign personnel can work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Mitigation Office, said that Indonesia's official representatives appreciated the situation in Palu, to see if international agencies would be allowed to undertake well-being or not.
In view of Indonesia's constant shocks, however, the country remains inconvenient to the years of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Akeh, they are not common for other areas.
The obvious absence of tsunami signs and even warnings in Palu have probably contributed to human loss.
In the best case, travel is difficult among many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make delivery much more complicated.
A medical aid ship located in Lambok, which was helping those affected by the earthquake, has taken the direction to Pala, but at least three days will depend on the new place affected by the disaster.
President Yoko Vidodon Indonesia's unstable infrastructure has made the most important contribution to its preferred campaign, as well as spending money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funding concerns Mr. Yoko's regime, because he's going to be elected next year.
Mr. Yoko also has problems with Indonesia due to inter-ethnic tensions, where most Muslims have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and more than 10,000 have left their homes when Christian and Muslim groups fought on the street using weapons, guns, rifles, and other violent weapons.
From Liverpool, Daniel Sterry has evened the game against Chelsea.
On Saturday at the London Stanford Bridge, Daniel Sterry, Prime Minister of the League, against the 89th minute of Chelsea's game, he saved Liverpool in an equal way.
Stairj received the ball from Hadran Shakir, 30 yards from Chelsea's gate, when his team was lost by 1-0.
He moved the ball to the left before he came to the gate.
A little bit higher than the door, because it went up to the right side of the door.
Finally, the ball went down by the sinking Keppa Arizabagaga and entered the gate.
- I was just trying to get to that position to get to the ball, but the players like Chess are always as fast as possible, so I tried, as long as I could get to the LiverpoolFC.com, starry told her.
- I noticed Kante approaching, I hit the ball a little bit, didn't even think about it, and I just hit it.
Chelsea won 1-0 when the 25th minute Belgian star, Eden Hazzard, opened the game record.
In that game before the Blues attacker reached the center of the field and the Liverpool gate would be opened from a short distance, the ball sent back to Mateo Kobačchi.
The climber quickly went back and forth in the central part of the field.
Then he hit a great goal towards the gate in the direction of Halsard.
The soldier came out of defense and ended the attack on the left, passing the ball to Alison Baker of Liverpool.
On Thursday at 3:00 p.m., Liverpool, in the Italian city of Naples, is playing with Naples, in the league stage of the Champions League.
Friday, at 3:00 p.m. in London, Chelsea meets with Videton at the WEFA European League.
As a result of tsunamis, the number of victims in Indonesia has increased by 832
The disaster relief agency in the country on Sunday morning reported that the earthquake and tsunami had caused the number of victims in Indonesia to rise to 832.
At the press conference, Mamlo-Chairman of the firm, Sutopo Puro Nugroo, announced that many people appeared under the roofs of the buildings, with an earthquake of 7.5 balls per Saturday, with an altitude of 20 feet.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 people, was found under the roofs of fallen buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man with suspicion of murder and murder.
The murder investigation began when the woman's body was found in Birkenhed, Merisid, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman's death was reported in the morning at 7:55 p.m. in Grayson Mouse, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested with a suspicion of murder.
The police encouraged people who had seen or heard anything in that area to address them.
Brian O'Hogan said, "The investigation is in the initial stages, but I want to encourage all those who have seen what has been done or something suspicious to hear on John's street in Brykenhead, to connect with us.
I'm asking everyone, in particular, to taxi drivers who may have fixed something with video recording devices, to contact us in case they have very important information for the investigation.
The police spokesperson confirmed the identity of the woman whose body was found in her house at Birkenhede.
In the middle of the day, friends who knew her came to the scene to ask if they had found a job in the morning.
The investigation is continuing, because the police have found that they're in the process of informing relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver in Grayson was trying to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to come in or out of the building.
He was nervous when he found out what happened.
The residents were told that it would take hours before they were allowed to return to their homes.
A police officer told a man that the whole area is now viewed as the scene.
There was a woman crying at the scene.
He kept repeating how terrible all this was.
In the afternoon, at 2:00 p.m., there were two police cars in the corner, and another car outside.
Several policemen were standing in the corner, guarding the living quarters.
We ask every person who has any information about the event, to call @MerPolCC in private, to call 101 or to call anonymously, the Crime Prevention Center at 0800555111, indicating September 30, 247.
In Parlment, Cromwell's half-story, "rewriting history" for controversy, becomes the last historical hive
His expulsion will be a poetic justice as the destruction of the cultural and spiritual works of the Taliban, by his deceptive Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Union described Mr. Creek's proposal as "stupidness" and "an attempt to rewriting the story"
John Goldsmith, the president of the Crimean Union, said, "It is inevitable that the debate on the removal of the present images, outside the Westminster Palace, will be transformed into a half-way goal of Oliver Crimea.
The ideas of England's civil war have not been ordered, nor have they been called by the Cromwell.
Perhaps in the past century, the wrong Crime was sacrificed because of the actions of his former Thomas.
Mr. William Hamo Tronicroff's excellent presentation on crime is evidence of the 19th century's opinion and historical point of view, which many are still growing.
Mr. Goldsmith told Sunday Telegraph: The crime is respected by many, of course, more than the last 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament, from outside pressure, in itself, of course, from the United States.
Whether it's completely accurate or not, it's subject to continuous historical discussion.
It's remarkable that the 17th-century conflict has shaped the future development of our nation, and the Crimean is a unique character that represents one side of that division.
His victories as a guardian are also worthy of appreciation and mention.
A man - made pig brutally kills a Chinese farmer
China's local media reports that in the south-west market, a pig was attacked and killed by a farmer.
South China Morning Post reports that on Sunday, a man was found in a dead state at the market at the Liupangi market in Gio's Bay, called Yua.
The peasants were about to see pigs on May 30th in China's Chinigi Kingha Bay.
On Thursday, he went with his cousin to the neighboring Yuna fair to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead and found that the neighbor's door was open.
He said there was a terrible man's dog in the bush, his mouth is bleeding.
According to the report, the trial confirmed that the 550-pound-weighted pig has killed the farmer.
"Guyang Evening News" quoted my cousin's knees as bleeding and sneezing, "Woo" as a cousin.
The security cameras fixed Yuan's entrance to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him, nor to his cousin.
Sku's boss told Jericho News that the pig had been beaten to death so that no one could be attacked until the police would gather evidence from the scene.
The Yuan family and the management of the market are talking about the compensation of his death.
In the past, there have been rare cases of an attack on a person by a pig.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts on their own farm, leaving the man with a critical injury.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig came on a tractor to a Welsh farmer, until his wife was able to force the animal to flee.
In 2012 in Oregon, farmers ate their own pigs, and a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News: "The pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can "draw them."
They just like to play.
They're like children, very interesting... they won't hurt you.
You just have to pay attention to them with the right amount.
The remnant of Puerto Rosa will bring abundant rains to the south-west of the United States.
As predicted, by moving the northern coast of Mexico on the water, the Rosa storm is apologizing.
Anyway, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rainy rains to northern Mexico and the south-west of the United States.
On Sunday morning, at 5:00 p.m., Rosa's strength was 85 miles, i.e. on the 1st floor of order, which is 385 miles from Mexico, Punta Eugenia.
It's expected that Rosa will move north this Sunday.
At the same time, on the Pacific, the ocean begins to form, and it begins to move from the east to the west, because on a two-week day, Rosa will approach the Bay of California as a tropical wind, which will bring south movement from the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to some parts of Mexico.
And then the sun's movement, when it interacts with the ocean, will flood vastly in the south-west in the coming days.
At the local level, the 1-4 inch rain can be the cause of floods, hurricanes, and possible floods.
The heart will cause the sun's movement in an hour of 2-3 inches of rain, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
There's a 2-4 inch rain in the south, especially in the big part of Arizona.
It's possible in extreme weather conditions, related to the nature of the rainy rain.
There's going to be a very bad advice: walking in the wilderness, in conditions of approaching rain.
The heavy rain can make rivers, and the clouds will bring strong winds and dust.
The approaching waterfall will cause heavy rains on the southern coast of California.
The half of the rains of cotton may be the cause of the leaking of small carbides and roads.
This is going to be the first rainy season in the region.
On Sunday night and on Saturday morning, some rains of the rainy sunset will begin to approach Arizona before the rain becomes more widespread on Saturday night and on Tuesday.
The rain of Tuesday will be poured into four corners and will continue until Thursday.
In the United States, in October, some of the intense temperatures can be observed, because the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropical is getting hot enough.
Sometimes this can cause severe heat changes in short distances.
On Sunday, there's a good example of thermal changes in Central America.
There's a difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Egypt and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and De Mue.
In the next few days, the summer long heat will try to spread again.
In October, in the central and eastern parts of the United States, there is a mild start (about 80 degrees) from the south-east to the north-east.
On Tuesday, the temperature in New York can reach 80 degrees above the average of about 10 degrees.
According to our long-term forecasts, there is a great possibility that by the first half of October, there will be a higher average in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million people watched Bret Cavanau’s hearings
On Thursday, more than 20 million people -- six televisions -- watched the trial of Bret Kavanau and Christine Bless Ford, who accused him of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
However, political resistance continued when broadcasters stopped regular telephony on Saturday last minute, Senator Jeff Bley of Arizona agreed that the FBI's annual cost check should be carried out.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that he was 100% convinced that Cavanauna was drunk and tried to take off his clothes at the school's graduation party.
The Kaunas' enthusiasm has shown that 100 percent are convinced that there was no such thing.
As Nielsen reports, more than 20.4 million people watched it on Saturday.
The company calculated the average number of views according to CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks that showed it, the indicators were not immediately available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
But "Nielsen" usually has some difficulty in calculating the statistics of people watching from the office.
From this point of view, the number of viewers corresponds to the number of football games or the number of academic awards.
Fox News (Fox News), whose public-interested guests have shown strong support for the Qawanau bid, is the leader of all networks, the average of 5.9 million viewers a day, says Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the trial, interest remained high.
On Saturday's tragedy, Fleigh was in the central role.
After the announcement by the civil service office of Kavanau to vote for the benefit of CNN and CBS on Friday, the video was sent to the protestors when he was trying to climb the court hearings station.
At the time of CNN's direct broadcast, he stood for a few minutes on the ground, because he felt upset.
- I'm standing right now in front of you.
- Do you think he's telling the earth the truth?
They said to her, "You have power when many women are weak," said one woman.
Fleigh said that his office had distributed a message and before closing the elevator doors, he said he would have a lot more to say in committee hearings.
All the cable and television networks made direct broadcasts later when the Judicial Committee had to inform the Senate of the election of the Qawanu bid.
But Fleigh said he'd only do it when he realized that the FBI was going to investigate the charges filed next week, which required a small number of Democrats.
Fleigh was partly convinced of his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns, after talking to him.
After speaking to Kunsi and many other senators, Fleigh made his decision.
Fleigh's choice was strong, because it was clear that the Republicans would have no votes without establishing investigations.
President Tramph has launched an investigation into the FBI, as part of a charge against Kavanau.
Britain's Prime Minister May, Brixit, blames the criticisms of "the political player"
In his interview with the Sunday Times, Professor Teresa May blames his plans for leaving Europe, as well as for hitting national interests, for the criticism of the "community player".
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Teresa May arrived at Birmingham, Britain, to attend the Conference of the Guardianship.
On the first page of the paper, another interview with him, former former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson expressed his discontent, as he was called, with regard to the plan of Brexit's investigators, presenting his proposal that Britain and the United States should unite their powers to be "profitful."
The fire on Wade Sims, the police arrested Daton Simpson, who was suspicious of the LPH player's death.
Police arrested the suspect -- 20-year-old LPH basketballist -- with the suspicion of shooting death on Wade Sims.
According to Baton Rue's report to the police department, 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for second-degree murder.
The video of Sims and Simpson's situation was officially published, and as the police say, Sims lost his eyes during the fight.
According to CBS, in WAFB's report, the police found the eyes from the scene, and they found Simpson's DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed his sin.
According to the lawyer's statement, his segment was $35,000.
On Saturday, the East Baton Rouge Trial Office published a preliminary report saying that the cause of death is the shooting of a gun in the head.
The division expresses its gratitude to the Louisiana Police State Operational Unit, the Criminal Police Laboratory, the South Police University and the local population to assist in the investigation into the arrest.
LPH's district manager, Joe Aleven, thanked the area's law enforcement forces for their "earning for prosperity and justice."
Sims was twenty years old.
He was very tall and grew up in Baton Rugh, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball in LPH.
In the last game, he won an average of 5.6 units and 2.6 influences.
On Saturday morning, LPH teacher Will Wade said the team was "feared" and "shocked" from Wade's death news.
"That's exactly what's always bothering you," said Wade.
The shark spread its smoke on Mexico
The smoke caused by the crackdown of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern regions of the capital of Mexico.
On the Sabbath, after 183 types of gas emissions were recorded in the volcano, and within 24 hours of the merger, the National Center for the Conservation of Oils warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano.
The center was controlling a lot of nerves and shocks.
In social media, pictures of Mexico's neighboring Chochimilco area show smoke-resistant coatings that cover the front of the cars.
As early as September 2017, the center of Mexico fell from a 7.1 earthquake -- the archaeologists, from the capital city to the south-east, saw an activity of about 45 miles (72 km) away.
The Don Goo volcano has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between police and Catalan activists, the pre-election anniversary of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on the Sabbath when independence protesters met with the police, and thousands of people joined the opponents to celebrate the first anniversary of Catalonia's independence.
A group of police-responsive activations were pushed back, and they were slammed in the air, and they were slammed in the streets with dusty, cloudy clouds that were constantly bothering the tourists.
Later, in the afternoon, the clashes with the police began again, and they used police killers to fight back.
In a few hours, the groups fighting for independence, singing "No forgetting, No forgiveness," met with democratic conservatives who shouted, "Living, Spain."
As the local press reports, 12 people who suffered mild injuries in the protest have been treated.
The tension in the area that gained independence was strengthened another year ago when Madrid was recognized as illegal by October 1st, but it was celebrated by inactive Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of the voters will vote for independence, although there was little presence among those who voted against the vote and had a lot of boutiques against the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, more than 1,000 people were injured last year as the police tried to stop the vote.
On Saturday night, independent groups came out to prevent the national police.
There was a breakthrough, but the show had to take a different direction.
68-year-old Electric Narcissus Hermes, who participated with his wife in the protest of the inactive, said that he no longer saw hope of gaining independence from Catalonia.
- Last year we lived one of the best moments of our life.
I saw my parents crying with joy, because they could vote, but now we're stoned, he said.
Despite the hard-to-record victory in the local elections last December, the Catalan independence parties were fighting to keep an eye on this year, along with their best leaders, who were imprisoned or detained, as a result of the organisation of the post of independence and independence.
42-year-old mechanic Juan Pig, who was recording a protest to support the police on his phone, said that the conflict was raised by both sides' politicians.
- The stress is getting more and more intense, he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junkarna, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been in the original court since last year, announced that next year he would participate in the European Parliament's elections.
-The role of the candidate in European elections, the delay of the popular values seen by the Spanish government's committee, and the best way to condemn the pressure, he said.
Londoners, men are arrested after they hit the car home.
33, 34, and 39-year-old men were beaten up when the car hit home in London several times.
The event took place on Thursday, in Bellingard Crescent at 7:30 local time.
The headmaster of the department, Bob Blemings, said he was damaged by the doors of the house and the building itself.
Maybe a cross was damaged in part by the car crash.
Playing with Rangers: Menga's 1-0 hit won Livingstone.
Dolly Mengana’s first goal was to win Livingstone’s victory
Livingstone's progress has confused Rangers, transferring Stephen Gerard to the head of the Ibrux team, which is the cause of his second loss in 18 games.
Dolly Mengan's strike, as if it was different from Gary Holt, reaching the second level of the Hibernian.
And the next Sunday, they meet with the leading Hart, 8 of whom are left together.
By then, on Thursday, Rapid Viennena had invited Rengersin to the League of Europe.
Livingstone, who continued his invincible race with Master Holt in six games, was losing so much time until last month's coach was replaced by Kenny Miller.
Livingstone left his options open to confused visitors.
Before you hit the goal, Holt's team was supposed to be ahead of them by creating multiple problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson went ahead, not trying to hit the goal, and then Alan Litgon was able to direct all his efforts towards a wide strike, meeting the strike on Craig Holkit's head.
The accepting side was pleased to let Rangers play in front of him, knowing that they could disturb visitors in certain parts.
And that was the exact way that the decisive goal was hit.
Rangers refused the free strike and Livingstone worked towards the opening, and Dean Gallagher and Robinson were trying to surround Menga, who took the ball and hit the gate from the center.
At this stage, Rangers had a dominant position and their gates were secure, and portkeeper Liam Kelley was invincible.
The style of the game was preserved until the second player, although Alfredo Morelos violated Kelly's security.
Scott Pittman was beaten on his feet by Rangers, by Alan McGregor, and Ligon, another player in Livingstone.
After two rounds, one in place of Holquitt was Glem Middleton, the other in the hand for the game, the cross-attacks at the Livingstone gate were constantly moving back.
- It was phenomenal, a review by Livingstone.
Aladdir Lamont to report to the Scottish BBC from Tony McCarón's arena
Incredible play and result for Livingstone.
According to one man, they were exceedingly proud, and continued to exceed their expectations.
After moving horizontally, the shape and composition of the players has changed considerably, but it's worth it to Holt, because the team has reappeared after it arrived.
He has so many heroes.
Captain Halket had done a great job to create a powerful defense, while Mengan was following Connor Goldson and Joe Wolley.
However, Rengers' inspiration was short-lived.
No matter how well they played with Gerard, they didn't match the standards.
Their last absence of the ball and their one-year opening was an alarm call for Rangers to appear in the middle of the game.
Erdalan was accepted as a member of the Governing Body.
There were white and blue clouds on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin at breakfast.
This was the last day of the opposition visit by President Erdala to Germany, which was intended to regulate relations between NATO partners.
They discussed many questions, including human rights, the freedom of the press, and Turkey's entry into the U.S.
Then Erdalan went to Kyle to participate in the opening of a huge mosque.
This city is home to the great Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police had taken security measures to close the group's entry, but many supporters were able to see their president from a distance.
Hundreds of opposition Protestants, many of whom were deaf, also made their voices heard, condemning the politics of Erdal, and accepting the decision of the German government in the country.
The crackling protests were reflected by some German Turks, the incompatibility of visiting as a hero and insulting him as a self-respector.
There was a car on the road to Defford, and a motorcyclist died in a car crash.
In London, a car driver died.
Wethar took place at 10:15 a.m. on a busy road in the south-east of the city of Defford, in Bestwood and Evel, across the street.
The car driver stopped, and in the presence of the witnesses, the man died at the scene.
The storm took place on the Childers Street, about a mile away from the day of the fall, a month after the death of another biker.
The mayor's police say they're working to figure out the identity of men and inform their relatives.
The road is closed, and the traffic directions of the buses have changed, and drivers have been urged to avoid that area.
Long Lartin's prison has been injured six times by the Incidents.
As the prison office reports, in a man's hard-duty prison, six deaths were inflicted on him because of his irregularities.
The riots have taken place in Long Larty's jail on Sunday at 09:30 local time, and continue until now.
The Spanish team "Tornado" was brought to the end of the riots, and eight prisoners from the same wing were involved.
The spas showed the treatment of minor facial injuries.
The prison service spokesperson said, "Long Larty has been brought to prison by a special trained prison staff to calm down the ongoing intervention.
Six personnel have been treated.
We can't tolerate any violence in our prisons, and it's clear that the perpetrators will be held hostages for a long time.
Long Larty has more than 500 prisoners, including some very dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison manager received hospital treatment as a result of the prisoner's attack.
And in October last year, cricketers were called to the prison to eliminate the serious incompetence in which the crew was being attacked with a floating ball.
Potrick Rosa threatens the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City.
For the solar cyclone, Arizona damage is rare, but that's what's probably going to happen next week, because the remaining energy of the Rosa storm is going to hit the Suswest Desert, which could be the cause of the flood.
The Ministry of National Planning has already considered the possibility of a flood on two Saturdays and three Saturdays, from West Arizona to south and east Nevada, southern California and Yuta, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's expected that Rosa will take the direction of the Tuesday to Phoenix, approaching two weeks later, in the evening with the rain.
The Finnish National Post Office on Twitter noted that “from 1950 to 200 million miles from Phoenix, only ten solar cyclones have maintained the state of the solar wind.
In 1967, Katrina storm moved 40 miles to Arizona's border."
The latest models of the National Power Center predict 2 to 4 rains, up to 6 rains in Arizona's Mgollon Rim.
The other areas of the Sousweist Desert, including Rocky and Big Basin, are likely to have a 1-2 inch water supply, possibly four inches apart.
For areas at risk of flood, Rosa can be a blessing, because the area is at risk.
Although the flood is a serious concern, these rains are likely to be useful to Sawfish, which is now under threat of danger.
According to U.S. weather.com's report, "As a result of Warsaw's monitoring, more than 40 percent of Arizona is under serious threat to the ex-categories."
From the beginning, the stormy Rosa route leads from the Bay of Mexico to the shore.
Rosa is still powerful in the morning, with the maximum wind power of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles south of Ponta Eugenia from Mexico and 12 miles per hour north.
Camin saves the Pacific ice on the water, and therefore its power increases.
So it's expected that there's going to be a place in Mexico on a two-week or two-week basis because of the wind.
In some parts of Mexico, the rains will be overcast, which may cause a serious flood.
As weather.com puts it, "3-6 inches of rain is expected from Baia California to the north-west Sonora, perhaps even up to 10 inches."
Then the northern Mexican of Rosa will be as a solar wind until three o'clock in the morning, and then three o'clock in the evening, and then three o'clock in the afternoon, they'll reach Arizona and they'll reach South Jutta.
- The greatest threat to Russia or its survivors -- the stormy rains in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the Suswest desert of the United States -- is reported by the National Potoric Center.
These rains are expected to trigger life-threatening floods and floods in the deserts as well as earthquakes in the mountains.
Attack in Mitsomer Norton, arrested four people who had committed suicide
Three young men and a 20-year-old man were arrested with a suspicion of being killed after finding a 16-year-old drug addict in Somerset.
On Saturday, around 4:00 a.m. local time, they found a boy in an injured state in the area of Exelsior Teresa, located in Mitsomer North.
He was transferred to a hospital where his condition was judged "fixed."
The police of Evan and Somerset report that on the night around Redstok, there were seventy-two young men and twenty-two men.
The police have called for all the people who might have a phone record to come forward quickly.
Tramp says that the Quano Democratic Party "has become a victim of anger"
To vote for the benefit of judge Qavana means to vote against the unchristian democratic community's unrelenting and unremarkable struggles, the Tromp said at a meeting held in West Virginia in Wiling.
The trump said that Qavanaan has become the victim of the Democratic Party's "suffering and anger" throughout its campaign.
On Thursday, Qavanaan witnessed to Congress in a critical and emotional way, rejecting the unwarranted charge of Christine Blassy Ford that he had committed sexual harassment against her years before she was a teenager.
Ford also testified in court after hearing about his accusation.
The president said on the Saturday, "The Americans saw the day of the intelligence, the characteristics and the courage of the country.
The vote for the Qawan judge is the vote of one of the most prominent and legitimate thinkers of our time, with a clear knowledge of public services -- he announced to a group of West Virginia supporters.
In the middle of the elections, the president pointed out that Quayana's bid was about the importance of the public meeting.
-The most important choices in our life are five weeks.
I'm not suggesting, but I'm actually suggesting.
That's why I'm fighting so hard for good bidders, he said.
The trump claimed that democrats have a duty to "demonstrate and resist."
The representative of the government of the Great Old Society (the Republican Society) told CNN that the first presidential election in Qawan is expected in the Senate not later than Friday.
Hundreds of people have become Indonesia's shock and tsunami victims with a loss of vision.
The authorities said that on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed as a result of the massive earthquake and tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Slovene, many of them were hit by the massive waves that hit the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered in one of Palu's beaches to participate in the festival on Saturday, when the six - foot - 18 - foot - long [18 m] river struck the girl on the beach and took with her the lives of people, destroying everything that was on her way.
Tuna followed the earthquake with 7.5 balls.
During the interview in Jakarta, the representative of BNPB, which was in the aftermath of the Indonesian disaster, told Suttopo Purvo Nugrohon that the night the tsunami became alarmed, people continued to do what they were doing on the beach, and they didn't get away from it, and they became victims.
"Tunami didn't come himself, he took with him cars, heroes, houses, he hit everything on the ground," said Negrohon, adding that until the beach hit the tsunami, he had hit it at 800 hours per hour (497 m/h).
Some people raised trees to protect themselves from tsunamis, and they were all left, he said.
About 16700 people were displaced in 24 centers of Palau.
There's a lot of ruined houses and shops, destroyed bridges, and a culvert surrounded by water.
The tensions continued to occur in the coastal areas on the Sabbath.
There's also an increase in tensions in the 2.4 million-population area.
The Indian Technology Assessment and Implementation Organization (BPPT) announced that the energy released as a result of a massive earthquake on Saturday was 200 times stronger than that of the second world war on Jerome and Nagaska.
It's said that the city's geographic location, which lies at the edge of the long, narrow seashore, could even increase the size of the tsunami.
The damage caused by the neutrophils was estimated to be large and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
Some of the victims' bodies were found under the roofs of the buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Negroho said that the victims and destructions could be larger in the water cycle -- 300 miles from Palu to the northern area of Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications in Dongala were "absolutely missing information," said Neugrohon.
The Red Cross said in a statement that there are more than 300,000 people living there, adding that the personnel and volunteers there were heading to damaged areas.
It's said it's already a tragedy, but everything could get worse.
On Sunday, the organization was highly criticised for not keeping track of the tsunami in Palu, although the spies said that the waves had reached the point where the warning had not yet arrived.
In a love video on the Internet, it's heard that the man in the above line is screaming like a loud warning to people on the streets of the subspecies of tsunami.
During the minutes, the water wall is facing the shore, taking the buildings and the cars.
The Reuters office was unable to verify the audio recording immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused massive power shortages, making communication around Palau impossible, and in turn, it has made it difficult for governments to send rescue forces to coordinates.
The authorities say that the army from Jakarta and other cities has begun to send help, but the displaced people still need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has only been rehabilitated for auxiliary forces, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has planned to visit the Palu demise centers on Sunday.
-In Indonesia, the number of tsunami victims has exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
While the World Vision staff of Dongala's World Vision arrived safely in Pala, where the workers were sheltered in the caverns in the back of their offices, they witnessed the visions of destruction on their way, said Mr. Dosebana.
They told me they saw a lot of ruined houses, he said.
It's very bad.
Even when the relief teams began to install disaster relief devices, some complained that the workers of the foreign relief team, who were better informed of it, had prevented Palu from travelling.
According to Indonesian rules, receiving assistance and labour can only begin if the disaster area is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still considered a state-level disaster," said Oulia Aryan, the Indian Red Cross Mámlo.
That's the government saying, "Good, this is a national disaster," we'll be able to get international help, but we don't have the right to it yet.
The second night, after the earthquake and tsunami in Palau on Friday, the families and friends of the dead were still hoping that their loved ones would be the wonders that had gone away painfully due to natural disasters.
On the Sabbath, they took a little boy out of the basket.
On Sunday, the rescuers drove out a woman who had spent two days under the roofs next to her mother's body.
Jenden Subandon, an Indian National Daplaning team coach, trained two of the missing Daplanists to attend the Asian games that took place in Indonesia earlier that month.
The rest of the Roa Roa's hotel, Mr. Mandagine Negro, was his students.
"As a paragliding expert, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Jenden tells us how he, after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, had spread the news in the Paraplanists' community, whatsapp sent desperate messages to Palu's competitors, who were participating in the Laundromats.
But his messages were only given a single cone certificate instead of two blues.
"I think that means that the messages have not been reached," he said.
Stealers in Newport Lviv have taken $26750 when they were cashing the banknote.
According to news reported by the Newport police, the thief on Saturday morning was charged $26750 from a Brinnian employee who assembled the banker in Newport Levi.
The car driver was emptying the ATM in a fun set and was about to get more money to Detroit, Dennis McCartt wrote in the broadcast:
While he was busy with it, another man fell behind a Brink's employee and grabbed the cash box that had to be sent.
According to the witness, he's noticed some suspects running away, but the police didn't tell how many people were involved in the incident.
People who have any information about their identity can contact the NYPD, 859-292-3680.
Kanye West, the rapper changes his name to yes.
Ripper Kanye West changes his name to yes.
And when he announced the change on Twitter on the Sabbath, he said, "It's officially known as the Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has been wearing Je's fists for a while, and he's hired it as his eighth album title, which was released in June.
The change succeeds on the Sabbath day at the right time of the night, where his new album was to be seen in Eden.
- She was replaced by Ariana Grande, who had recently considered her speech "cause of emotion," said the show organizer.
In addition to being subject to his current name, Wess pointed out that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think yes" is the most popular word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," earlier this year, West's radio broadcaster Big Bo discussed the title of his album.
- So, I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It's spread out from Canada, which means only Y, and it's become our best, the most confusing, the reflection of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our real self.
He belongs to a list of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Cobbs was very well known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names "Ser" and "Sernant Love".
JEY-ZIN, who was singing with Wess, also wrote his name with or without charts and letters.
Mexico's president Andres Manuel Loch Obrador swore not to use the army against the citizens.
Mexico's elected president, Andres Manuel Loch Obrador, has promised never to use military force against citizens, because the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of bloody revenge against students.
On Saturday at the Talatelloco complex, Locke Obrador promised never to use military forces to pressure Mexicans.
On October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration, the troops fired fire, killing almost 300 people, when the left movements of students were widespread throughout Latin America.
Like Obrador, he has promised to help young Mexicans to make a monthly contribution to those who are learning, and to build more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education make it possible for young people to become members of a criminal group.
The U.S. needs to double the funding of artificial intelligence.
"As China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States has to double the amount spent in this field, for research work," says investment and artificial intelligence professional Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The interviews come after the various parts of the U.S. government have made statements about artificial intelligence, while the U.S. has no form of artificial intelligence itself.
At the same time, last year China presented its programme, their goal is to become the first in the field of artistic intelligence in 2030.
"Reflective intelligence research budgeting is a good start, given that the United States is quite advanced from other countries, and we're looking forward to the next progress in artificial intelligence," said Lee.
In this interview this week, Lee CNBC has announced that double funding can double the next big win that the US will achieve in the field of artificial intelligence.
He was the chief executive director of Synovation Ventures, whose book "The Overwhelming of Human Intelligence: China, Silicone Daist, and the New World Order," published this month by Woot Miffly Harcourt, has contributed to one of China's most recent artificial intelligence organizations, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at the University of Carnegie Melon on an artificial intelligence program that won the highest-ranking U.S. actor, Oteleo, and then became the CEO of Microsoft Research and the CEO of Google, the China branch.
He accepted the previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Protection Council's Robotic Challenges of the Organization of Research Projects and asked when it would be next to help find the next creators.
- U.S. researchers often have to work a lot to get the state money.
-He takes academic leaders, not China, but corporations, he said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology organizations have recently hired well-known experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
It was said that the change in immigration welfare could also help the US strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think you should send a letter to the professors of artistic intelligence immediately," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese National Council presented its next generation's artificial intelligence development programme.
-The National Institute of Natural Sciences of China is funding people who belong to academic institutions, like the National Science Foundation and other government agencies are paying money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lynn said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence founded the Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Hamaman, designed to involve partners in industrial and academic fields, and the White House announced the formation of the Department of the Choice of Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that $2 billion was invested for an initiative called "AI Next."
As far as NSF is concerned, it now invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, U.S. legislation, which seeks to create the National Security Conference of Artificial Intelligence, has not done anything in months.
Macedonians celebrate "To Change the Name of the Earth"
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted during the ceremony to change the name of the country: "The Republic of North Macedonia," a step that would help resolve the disagreement with Greece over the years, which had become an obstacle to the membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, whose country is Macedonia, claims to bear that name on its north side, means that its territory is under attack and has banned its entry into NATO and Europe.
Both governments have signed a new name proposed in June, but national opponents argue that the change will destroy the ethnicity of most of Macedonia's Slavonic population.
President Georgie Ivanov announced that he would not participate in the vote, and there were doubts among the Bokot publishers about whether participation would require at least 50 percent for the corresponding audience to be counted.
The question of the Montenegrin issue is, "Are you in agreement with NATO and the membership of Europe and the acceptance of the Greek Constitution?"
The parties to the revolution, including Prime Minister Zoran Zawi, argue that it is the price of becoming a full member of NATO or of Europe for Macedonia, which was one of the countries that could survive after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, under the care of the youth of Macedonia, for the well-being of Europe, because it means a safer life for us all," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgesca in Skopje.
Although it's not legally binding, enough members of the council have said that they will remain the opposite of the results of the election to make it a decision.
The change takes part in the majority of the council's 2/3.
The election committee said that there was no report of the inconsistencies until one hour ago.
But the vote was 16 percent compared to 34 percent of 2016 elections when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Giose Tanevsky, capital of Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in the Macedonian city of Strumica, Zav, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran, his wife Zorika, and his son Dukkon, completed their polls in Ankara in order to change the name of Macedonia so that the country's path to NATO and Europe would be restored.
In front of the Council in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardak was making a small stage and giving the chairs in front of the tents that had been placed there by the anti-personnel people.
- We're on the side of NATO and Europe, but we want to proudly join them, but not from the service door.
- We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to China and Russia and become part of European integration," Kavarduk said.
Worker Zawi says that NATO membership will make great investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be on the side, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are on the side of NATO and Europe," Zawi said after filling his ballot.
He said "yes" would be "a charm of a good future."
According to a poll published by the Macedonian political research institute on Saturday, 30-43 percent of voters voted side by side, which is less than the votes required.
Another question on Telma TV is that 57 percent of Macedonia is still going to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they were going to vote.
In order to succeed, it has to be 50 percent and one voice.
The failure of the community will be the first serious attack on the well-being of the Western government since May.
See, Manchester City Sergio Aguro won the entire defense of Brittany to hit the gate.
Sergio Aguero and Raim Sterling were released from the British defense in respect of Manchester City, 2-0, which took place in England on Sunday -- Manchester Ethihad.
Aguero made it easy for the 65th minute of the game to get his shot.
The Argentine attacker was broadcast in the center of the field at the very beginning of the game.
He slammed through three British defenders until he crossed the open field.
After Aguro was surrounded by four green hats.
He walked through one, went through another of the gates of Brittany.
And then he did in the transmission to Sterling on his left.
The English attacker, when he reached the gate, pushed the ball back to Aguero, who struck the ball on his right foot, pointing it towards the British porter Matthew Ryan, and the ball went right into the gate.
"Aguero has some problems with his leg," the city manager said to the reporters of Pep Guardíola.
We talked about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Our lucky thing was that he was able to record a bullet at that moment.
But Sky Blass gave the Prime Minister Sterling an initial favour in the League.
That ball was recorded in the 29th minute of the game.
Aguro got the ball in the Britstown.
He did the beautiful transmission of the ball to Leo Seine on the left.
Shane did a few strokes, and then he passed the ball to Sterling, which was on the other side of the field.
The Sky Blossoms threw the ball into the gate until the boundaries were cut.
Sittin will go out against Hoffenheim in a friendly game of the Champions League on Tuesday morning at 12:55 in the Rhine-Negar Arena in Sin Sheim, Germany.
The Cheres want to win an unexpected victory against the Rockies.
Since the Nationals were out of the game, it was pointless to start again.
But with a competitive spirit, Cheres hopes to go out against the Colorado Rocky Sunday, but only if it's possible to make peace with Rocky, who will be at peace with Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies have at least provided a place for them, taking 5-2 on Saturday to win against the Nationals, but they still hope to keep the first title in their division.
Although we play for nothing, we can throw the ball, confident that the Denver atmosphere and the crowd will also be the opposite team at the highest level I'd meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?
Nationals still have to announce the beginning on Sunday, but as they report, they tend to let Cherser show up in this situation.
The scars that had to be hit by his 34th strike, threw the ball on Thursday and will return to his usual rest on Sunday.
The right hand of Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 cars at 220 2⁄3 in the time zone.
The trumpet is a rally in West Virginia.
The president has been directly involved in a talk on the importance of the inter-state elections in Brett Qawana's election.
Everything we've done will be under threat in November.
The most important choices in our lives have remained for five weeks.
- This is one of the biggest, biggest choices. I'm not suggesting, but I'm actually proposing, and that's why I'm fighting so much for good bidders, she said.
The trumpet went on, you see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see how it's happening now.
And they're ready to return the power at any cost, you see the deception and the shooting.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to go through to get power and government, that's what they need, and we're not going to give it to them.
-Democrats, he says, have a mission to resist and resist.
And you see it in these four days, he said, "People are angry, angry, immoral, and deceptive."
He made contact with the Senate Judicial Committee Democrat Sen, Diane Feynstein, who's got high heels from the auditorium.
Do you remember his answer?
Have you done the document?
Uh, uh, what:
No, no, I'm waiting for someone... it was a very bad body language... the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Leborist community is no longer a large church.
It's very tolerant of those who express their thoughts.
When Momentum's Activist local community beat me to death, it wasn't surprising.
Finally, I'm the last person on behalf of the Leborist community to say that we're not happy to see you here... and that's all because of expressing our thoughts.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, showed a similar attitude because he was determined to oppose anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I've been criticised by the rapists because I'm against Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policies, national security, Europe, and the scale of problems that Jeremy did not agree with with the former leaders.
We want the meetings to be meaningful and effective.
As a local labour force messenger for the past eight years, the GC congregations were just like that on Saturday.
It's sad that many congregations today are not like that, and it's forgotten since politics, of course, if it's ever been.
El became more evident that the Leborist community did not tolerate different views and everyone's opinion was seen as acceptable or unacceptable by the community leaders.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when my colleagues, with whom I thought I was sharing a common political view, began expecting me to change my views and have views that I would never otherwise agree with... whether it was national security or the US single market.
I'm talking to the public (and I don't know what I'm saying), and on social networks, it follows the flow of insults, calling for, and eliminating elections, condemning central politics, and telling me that I don't have the right to be in a Leborist community.
And that's not just my experience.
Of course, I know that I'm happier than some of my colleagues because the comments I made in my address are political.
I'm amazed at the skills and determination of my colleagues who tolerate sexual or racist abuse every day, but they never get away with it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how the levels of injury have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin announced last week that the Leborist community should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this enlarged church, and the participation of any movement of "insecurity" or change in the rules of choice becomes more fishy.
Over the past two years, I've been advised to put my head down, not to talk so much, and then it'll be all right with me.
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since 32 years ago, I've joined the Liberals as a school student from being ignored by the Tatcher government, which is why my school class was literally down, and I've been trying to provide better public services to those who need it most, be a local advisor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics; the last elections are not an exception.
There's no one in East Nottinham to confuse my political views and the disagreements with today's leaders.
All I'm going to say to those who are moving on Saturday is that when the country moves to Brexit, which will damage the household, business and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on the leader of the Leborist community.
But actually, my only statement is not about the Nottinham Monument, but about my party, or the Leborist community, or not, and I'm proud to serve you and promise you that none of the options or political expectations will hold me back from doing what I find to come from all of your benefits.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose is rising.
The last two experiments could have changed the final outcome somehow, but Eir was undoubtedly worthy of victory this wonderful and fun day of the Tennent Primership.
They're now at the top of the table, on the only side of the tens.
Finally, it was their supreme protection, as well as their success, which won the host side, and coach Peter Mürich had the full right to be satisfied.
"We've been tried in these games, but we haven't won yet, so I have to be happy," he said.
From Melrose, Robin Christy said, "Aprie Arry, they took better advantage of their opportunities than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute strike, which led to Frasier Hughes, led to Ery, but at the Scottish court of Rudy Hughes, the yellow card he had received for the game with the Warriers, gave Melrose an opportunity to add the bill, and Jess Begot did the unbeatable.
Climone so far prolonged her initial position as a tugan, after she went through the middle of the time, she worked together, and then she tried to strike herself alone, to make her score 17-5 for Ery.
But Melrose well started the second game and the beat of Patrick Anderson, which had handed over to Beggot, reduced the difference in consideration by five units.
Then there was a long stop, which was the cause of the serious damage to Rurid Nott, and he was removed, and after the reintroduction, Eyre went further through the stroke of Stefan McDowell through Climoo.
Captain Blair McPerson then received a yellow card, and once again Melrose suffered a further blow from Bruce Colvin at the end of a severe pressure.
The guest side, however, came back, and when Strawton Hutchinson got a yellow card on Climoo without throwing a bullet out, McPerson fell on the ball that was moving ahead of her.
Clymbon struck, as he started almost again, then Kyle Rowe prevented David Armstrong's attack and sent the flanger Gregor Henry away to cut off the hygienic blow on the guest side.
Still Game star is ready to start a new career in the restaurant field.
The star of Still Game is ready to move to the hospitality area after it became clear that he became the director of a registered restaurant company.
He plays the role of Jack Jarvis in a well-known BBC show, which he wrote and in which he is filmed with his former partner, Greg Hamphyll.
The couple announced that the 9th series in advance would be the last series of reports, and it became clear that Kirna was planning her life after Craiglang.
According to official lists, he's the director of Edithtmore Limothy.
Derasan refused to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun has pointed out that Kiran wants to be included in Glazgo's "smashing restaurant."
"The sea is ours." Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes that the court will reverse the way to the Pacific.
The ships are keeping La Paz's military stop.
Public buildings have cut off the ocean blue flag.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon military station, the sea is ours by law.
It's our duty to restore it.
In the 19th century, the memory of Chile's lost water line, as well as the Pacific once more, remained burning in Bolivia, during the bloody conflict with Chile's resources.
These hopes may be at the highest level in the decades, because Bolivia is waiting for a decision on October 1st of the International Court of Justice after five years of consultations.
Bolivia has a goal, it has a spirit of unity and peace, and, of course, expects a good end, said Roberto Calzadilla, the Bolivian biologist.
Most of the Bolivians will look at the decision of the MDD, which will be shown to all the big screens of the country, hoping that the Haaga tribunal will be on the side of Bolivia's claim that Chile is obliged to negotiate with Bolivia and give it a way out of the sea.
Evo Morales, the local charismatic president of Bolivia, who is now leading a decisive struggle for election, has also played a decisive role in the two-week decision.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts think that the court's decision will not benefit Bolivia, and that would change little if it did.
The United Nations in the Netherlands has no control over Chile's areas, and said that this would not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
Since the MDD's decision comes six months after hearing about the final contradictions, it shows that the case was not "hard," said Chilean expert Paz Zarat.
And from the further progress of Bolivia's work on that side, the past four years could have delayed it.
-Bolivia's problem of accessing the sea was ignored by the current government of Ebolvia, Zarat said.
Moralese's military speech was the reason for Chile's last stamps of kindness were removed.
Finally, Bolivia and Chile will continue the relationship one day, but then the discussions will be very difficult.
The two countries have not been exchanged as ambassadors since 1962.
In The Hague, the representative of Bolivia and former president of the country, Eduardo Rodríguez Wellsen, rejected the idea that the court made an extraordinary decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given an extraordinary opportunity to start a new circle of relations with Chile, and an opportunity to "end the 139-year-old conflict with bilateral interests," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales was still one of the most prominent presidents in Latin America, using the sea as a political instrument.
Bolivia will never refuse to leave the Pacific out of its power -- he added.
The decision allows us to see that we have to overcome the past.
North Korea says it won't be nuclear weapons until the U.S. has confidence.
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Rhy Young John, says his people will never be able to fight the nuclear weapon until he can trust Washington.
Rin was speaking on Sunday in the United Nations headquarters.
He called on the United States to follow his promises, which he gave at the Singapore summit of opposition leaders.
His comments come as the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompoon, as it were, is located at the end of the closing nuclear division with North Korea Kim Chen Yun, more than three months after the Singapore Summit.
According to Rie, it's a "genorous dream" that continues to apply punishments, and the story against the U.S. Korean War will never go down.
Washington warns us to agree to the ad without the Pionang military action.
And Kim, and the U.S. President Donald Tramp wants a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that the Pyongyang is serious about refusing military equipment, which the country probably considers the only way to ensure security.
Pompé is going to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Tramph's next summit.
A new collection of hats was presented in the exhibition of the Parisian fashion, which will soon be on the High Street.
If you want to expand your cape collection and protect yourself completely from sunlight, that's what you need.
Vincent and Tom Brown have presented the SS19 of their new collection of large coins in Paris during the week of their remodeling, and that collection has surprised everyone.
Many inefficient capillaries have become a documentary trend this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations to the podium.
Valentine's most expensive collection was a huge body cap with a wide range of embroidery wrapped on the model's head.
There are also too large axesuras, which include beautiful snowflakes, magic hats, and even royal anthems -- but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also showed the choice of outsiders -- that is, Halloween.
Many of the colorful faces had lipsticks that reminded Hannibal Lekter more of than high weight.
One of the creations was to remind the underground sinking device, along with its tubes and eyes, while the other was like a haunted pan.
And if you continue to make a high declaration of reciprocity, you'll be successful.
Poor viewers predict that giant cats can soon appear on your main streets.
The larger than usual was the "La Bomba" -- the two-legged, two-legged lead that was seen at everybody's side from Rihanna to Emile's Radajkewsky.
The label of the worship of an extremely inappropriate cap, which was spread through all social media, sent another great creation in the podium, a muddy puddle, which was almost as big as a swimwear model.
The Mugh Pacific Raffia Pack, a pre-predicted and covered white skin cap, is the worst in Paris's recent week of the Jacem La River's SS19 collection.
Astronomer Luke Emitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see large caps and floating boxes in the main tables next summer, because the designers have had such a powerful influence that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for large elevators.
John Edward, language skills are very important to global citizens.
Independent schools in Scotland keep record of academic excellence, which was continued in 2018 with another amazing series of results of examinations, which was only strengthened by individual and group success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
In Scotland, over 30,000 students from these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to provide their students and parents with the highest level of services.
Whether schools try to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as a global citizen.
As an educational area that can plan and implement a pre-defined curriculum, we see that the high-level languages continue to be disbanded and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, he'll get his head.
If you speak to a man in his own language, that's what's in his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's review, we can see that languages are on the top of the League's table, with the highest percentage of past independent schools.
68 percent of students learning foreign languages have received a high grade A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students received high grades in the A Manduran language, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students also received A.
This shows that schools that are independent of Scotland's foreign languages as necessary skills that will undoubtedly be maintained by children and young people in the future.
Now, in schools, languages as a choice are treated in the same way as STEM objects (knowledge, technology, architecture and mathematics).
In 2014, the UK Department of Employment and Skills has identified the reasons why employers find it difficult to fill out job vacancies, 17 percent of which have been attributed to a lack of language skills.
So language skills become more and more important to make young people their future careers.
In view of the opportunities for more language learning, these skills have become important in the global world.
No matter what career they've chosen, if they've learned a second language, they're going to have a real advantage in the future, mastering until the end of life, which is what this is.
Having the ability to communicate directly with foreigners in a number of languages will automatically lead to competition.
According to a 2013 YouTube survey, 75 percent of British adults were unable to speak in a foreign language as much as they could speak, and French was the only language spoken in a global percentage of 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
Mastering a number of languages, especially in developing countries, will allow children to find meaningful work.
Every school in Scotland will be taught in its own language.
A number of schools will focus on higher-class languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for Great Britain in 2020.
Whatever your child is interested in, no matter how many languages you can choose from in schools, and the staff of these schools are experts in this field.
The aim of Scottish independent schools is to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and identify them with the skills they need to achieve success, regardless of what lies ahead.
Now, in this global business environment, we can't deny that languages are still really important for the future of the country, so this should be in education.
In fact, the major languages must really be called "international communication skills."
No matter how schools continue to offer these choices, diversity and superiority to Scottish youths.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the president of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
Lebron has to make Lakers' debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait for the missionaries to see Lebron James’s debut in Los Angeles is near its end.
Laker's coach Luke Wellton announced that James would play the opening of the pre-season Sunday against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play, he'll have to decide.
"It'll be more than a minute, but less than 48," said Walton at Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, from Laker's paper, wrote that James would probably play a limited time.
Following earlier this week's performance, James was asked about his plans for Lakers, a six-game pre-season chart.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career," he said.
Trampy: West Virginia community time, Jutuba River
President Donald Drump is starting a wave of preferred campaigns tonight in West Virginia, Wiling.
This is the first of five public meetings scheduled for the next week of Trump, including standing in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
In order to fill the seat of the Supreme Court, the bravery of his election has been delayed and the Tromp is trying to build support for future internal elections, because the citizens are at the end of losing control of Congress, while the voices will be counted in November.
What time is it going to be in West Virginia? And how can you watch it online?
The tramp community meeting in West Virginia is scheduled at 7:00 a.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can view the Trans-Tramp, a public meeting in West Virginia, online with the Yutubian route below.
The campaign will probably talk about the hearings of Brett Qawan, the Supreme Court of this week, which has become the subject of sexual harassment, bringing with it a weekly investigation of the sinister case of the Senate.
But the main objective of the wave of these communities is to help citizens who stand before the elections that take place in November in order to gain momentum.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign said that the next week’s 5 public meetings aim to “encourage volunteers and supporters, while citizens try to protect and expand the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” says Rothers.
"Congress control is so important to its system that the president will move as many states as possible until we enter the promotional season," Dramph's promotional speech, which refused to mention his name, according to Rothers.
Today's public meeting in Wesbanko Arena in Hijjah can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania to receive enlightenment from the Pittsburgh media, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
In the last month, it will be the second day of the week that Dramp visits West Virginia, where he won in 2016 with more than 40 percent of the units.
The trump is trying to help Patrick Morris, a candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is on the electoral list.
"It's not a good sign for Morris that the president has come to try to motivate him in the election," said Simon Heder, who is a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to the Rothers.
The U.S. Rider Bay 2018 team was confident that hopes would stay alive until Sunday's game.
After three unique sessions, on Sunday after midnight, the square could just be what this Ryder cup needed.
It's a full-fledged sports idea that players really believe in and never more than they do in such competitions.
So, according to them, where is the motor power now?
"They had a six-unit excess, which is now four, and I think we're keeping it as a little moving force," Jordan Spewt said on that day.
Europe has no doubt 4 units of excellence and 12 has to play.
The Americans, as Speit says, feel that there is a little wind in their tails, although they have a lot to breathe, not a little less than the shape of Speithe and Justin Thomas, who have played with each other all day, and each of them has added 3 units of four.
Spite was dead at the time of "tee to green" and led by example.
The hummingbirds of the festival were even stronger, as his round continued, and he was hit with a decisive blow to get the right to play in four fields when he and Thomas agreed after two.
His battle, which won them 15 times, was matched by a kind of pride that tells you that he believes the American team isn't out of it.
"You have to work more and worry only about your game," Spitt said.
This is what each of these players has left now.
18 hours to make a sign.
The only players who have more units than Spyt and Thomas in the last 2 days are Francesco Molinari and Tom Flithfood, the unmistakable story of the Ryder Bay.
It's strange in Europe, but the attractive couple is 4 out of 4 and can't be wrong.
"Molywood" was the only couple who didn't get on the Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on the Saturday morning, on the Saturday afternoon, and on the Saturday morning, on the golf course.
That race and how their energy seemed to flow to that mad crowd and return, confirms that they are players, who should win on Saturday, and would no longer be more famous than the Fleetfood or the Molinary, that the woman's potential European victory, while the sun enters the Le Golf Nation.
It's preferable for both of them to be at the same time, at different times.
But the speeches about European glory are still very early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson wrote a short work about Sergio Garcia, the morning golf hero, when he was Alex Nora's colleague.
One garden and two doubles on the first nine moved the Spaniard and the Swede to the hole from which they never made it.
Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of your pit.
Looking at the four balls and squares is so interesting: relationships between couples, their advice, their unsolicited advice, and how the competition can change in a moment.
Europe as a team has been better played during this period and has made remarkable progress until the end of the day, but the four-week session has shown that the US team has shown such excitement that no one, especially the Sitsid, would expect.
On the closing day of the Ryder Bay, Europe had a 10-6 progress.
On the day of the Ryder Bay, Europe will have a great deal of improvement in the performance of the rainy and four-quarters of the week, with 10-6 for the United States.
The inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Franco-Molinary couple changed the game count by two wins against the opposing Tiger Woods to get their toss up to La Golf National.
Thomas Byron's European side, who was trying to bring back his garden lost two years ago in Hezelton, reached the government on the American side in the morning of the game, 3-1.
The U.S. showed greater resistance during the game, but they failed to win.
Jim Four's side needs 8 single games on Sunday, 12 single games to return the tower.
Fleetwood is the first European player to win 4 singles, while he and Molinary, who have received the name Molinwood after the rest of the day, are only the second of the couples who won four singles in the history of the Ryder Bay during their initial four games.
After beating Woodsy and Patrick Reedy in four bullets, they worked hard to pay off Woods and the American player Braiss Dechambeu, a larger than 5-4.
The Woods, who gave himself a career between two games on the Sabbath, showed a great game, but he had already lost his 29 games, 19 of which 7 of them, behind each other.
Justin Rose, resting on the game that took place in the morning, returned to Henry Stanson's four-quarters game and lost Dusty Johnson and Brooks Coepskin, who are the first and the third of the world.
Europe, however, did not have that pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris in its own way.
The Erka champions Jordan Spheth and Justin Thomas put the two units in front of the Americans on a Saturday.
They won 2-1 on Spanish John Rami and Jan Polter in four games and returned later to win Pocketer and Roy McCillrow on 4-3, leaving two holes in the square.
It was only twice in the history of the Ryder Bay that the team returned with the missing 4 units and went to the game of the singles, even though it only had to be on the side of Farik to preserve the castle.
After two days of being the second best ever, after the opposite of Sunday, it seems like this place is above them.
North Korea says "no case" won't be completely armed without confidence.
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continuing sanctions are strengthening confidence in the United States, and the country will not in any way refuse its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
R. Yong Hoon said at the world's most annual Central Congress that North Korea had undertaken "significant means of improvement" last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and counter-refractory testing, the decommissioning of the mid-test station, and the responsibility not to distribute nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we don't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
Without confidence in the United States, we can't have the security of our nation, and in such circumstances we won't be the first to fight.
While Reyn repeated North Korea's well-known dissatisfaction, the "pull" approach of Washington, which will be implemented before it gradually takes action, its declaration was important, because it did not give up the sole resurgence, as it did in the past.
In Singapore on June 12th, Rin was the leader of North Korea, Kim Young Won, and the United States President Donald Tramph, at the first joint summit, where Kim promised to work on the North Korean Peninsula, while Tromph promised to secure North Korea's security.
North Korea has always wanted to end the Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Phenyan must first surrender his nuclear weapons.
Washington also rejected the call to soften the harsh international sanctions applied to South Korea.
-The United States claims that "remediation will be a priority" and increases pressure through sanctions to reach its goal necessarily, and even rejects "the declaration of the end of the war," said Rin.
The realization that punishments can put us down is just a dream for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continued punishments also increase our uncertainty.
Ren didn't say anything about Kim and Trump's second summit program, which the U.S. leader stressed earlier this week in the United States.
Instead, the president stressed the 3rd meeting between the leader of Kim and South Korea, Mun Jay-In, over the past five months, and added, "If South Korea were on the side of this problem, but not the United States, the Korean Gulf would not be on the side of this issue.
If so, Ri's talk was quite different from last year's talk when he said at the U.S. U.S. Central Congress that the U.S. continent's shooting with North Korean fires became inevitable after the "Pero Evil President" Tromp called Kimin by sending himself a "True Man."
This year in the United Nations, the Trump who threatened to destroy the lion last year, North Korea, praised Kim for his courageous steps, but said there was still a lot of work to be done, and the punishments should continue until North Korea is over.
Thursday, which Tramph said there's no time limit for it, saying, "It's not important if it's two years, three years, or five months."
China and Russia claim that the United Nations Security Council has to compensate for the steps taken by Phenyan.
However, U.S. Secretary-General Mike Pompey said on Thursday on the United Nations Security Council: "The use of sanctions by the Security Council should actively and without failures to the full, final, established refusal.
Since 2006, the Security Council has started to apply sanctions to North Korea to prevent Phenyan's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
Pompey met in the districts of the United Nations, the Greater Assemble, and he found that next month he would regroup to prepare the second peak of Phenya.
Pompey's gone to Phenya three times this year, but the last visit didn't go so well.
He left Phenya in July, saying that he had been registered, and that North Korea had been able to accuse him of presenting "constasive demands" within hours.
At this month's meeting, North Korea promised to mount the fire station and the nuclear power plant if the United States did "appropriate resources."
He told Kim that the "appropriate means" in Singapore are the security assurances of the Tampa promised and aimed at improving the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard University are taking a special course on how to get enough rest.
The new course allowed his final students to sleep more to fight the growing macho culture, it's with the help of caffeine all night long.
Academics has found that students in one university in the world often have no basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
This course was composed by Professor of Harvard School of Sleep Medicine and Professor of Brigam and Kanes Hospital Charles Kaiser, who claims it is the first in the United States.
He was excited to start his course on how the incompetence had an impact on education.
Finally, a girl approached him and said, "Why am I only now, in the senior course, knowing about this?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping, which is very surprising," he told Telegraph.
The first course of this year explains to students how the habit of sleeping well can affect education and education, as well as general self-esteem.
Professor of Health Services at Harvard Medical School and University of Health Director Paul Barry said that the university decided to take a look at the course that the students did not really sleep that week.
An hour-long course includes various interactive tasks.
In one part of it is a hall where students are aware of the influence of caffeine and light, and how the incomplete sleep can affect the condition of the living room, as well as the importance of sleep.
In another part, participants are presented with a view to increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
An interactive map encourages participants to think about daily life.
"We know this can't change the behavior of students right away."
"But we believe they have the right to know about it, as you have the right to know about the consequences of using tobacco on your health," added Professor Kaiser.
According to his All-night Drawing, a proud culture still exists, he added that modern technologies and their ever-growing pressure on students mean that insecurity is a growing problem.
What sleep should be enough is the stress, fatigue, and anxiety to overcome the student's secret weapon, even the weight gain to prevent it, because the absence adds to the brain's hunger regime, and they're always hungry.
Raymond, 19-year-old californic student in chemistry and physics, is helping Professor Kaisler to organize a course in Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired the whole university.
Next, he expects the audience to be asked to participate in this educational program before participating in the establishment competition.
Professor Kaiser advises students to schedule a reminder when to go to sleep when to wake up. Also to learn about the harmful effects of the blue light released by electronic screens and LED lights, which is in the process of sleeping.
Liveingston's $180 Rangers Menga lost the heat.
The Rangers were hit once again because Dolly Mengani was defeated by Steven Gerard's team in Livingstone at 1,00.
Imbrox wanted to record his first victory in Johnston, but Gary Holtz's team disappointed Gerard for the second time, winning the tenth game, leaving the 8-unit difference in Ledbrok's prizes at the League.
Mengan came out of the game seven minutes ago and it seemed that the Rangers' team would never be ready to play.
While the Rangers are the sixth horizontal, Livingstone goes with a number of third horizontal goals to the Hibernian.
There was another problem for the rangers later, because the liner protection in Kale Spence was damaged because of what was thrown into the head.
Gerhard's eight-unit difference also led to a semi-final replacement of Eryrin by Betfred.
On the other hand, Holt joined a unit that took up Livingstone last week, and was amazed at how the opponents were being harassed by his good preparation.
The Rangers may have been a dominant, but Livingstone used more money.
They used two minutes when Megan got out of the game for the first time, which gave Scott Pittman the opportunity to kiss Alan McGregor's door, but the guard cut the ball.
The plague of Kagan Jacobs reached Craig Halket, but Alain Litgoon was only able to cut the ball.
The Rangers took the game by hand, but in the last half of the third, there was more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelles was supposed to have a tongal strike because he was in conflict with Steven Loilles, but the winner, Steven Thompson, did not pay attention to the names of the Colombians.
The Rangers made two hits in the first game, but Inbroxy's ex-prisoner Liam Kelly was worried about Lasana Colibay's and Ovi Ijaria's hits.
In the 34th minute of Livingstone, the opening of the game was against the rules of the game, but no one could deny that it was worth the shot.
The Rangers were unable to resist the attack of Jacob again.
Scott Arfield did not respond to the fact that Dean Calagher gave the gun to Scott Robinson, who handed it over to Megan to finish.
Gerhard replaced Calibal with Ren Kent, and then the attacker attacked Morelez, just like Killy immediately cut the ball.
Livingstone kept making the audience happy with his game, because Lithoon and Halquitt kept the ball at their side.
Holt's teammates could run the game in some stages for their own good, but McGregreger was able to get back to Jacobs before he hit the Litgoon corner.
Instead of the Rangers, Glen Middleton was supposed to be entitled to tobacco again, because they were against Jacobs, but Thompson ignored it again.
The calculator of the German Giger calculator
And now a part of our Sunday morning from Germany. September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, this day, physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Giger was born in Germany.
Giger developed a method to detect and measure the radiation, which resulted in the Giger calculator.
At times, the core of science, Ginger, also became one of the cornerstones of the pop culture, such as the Coronado calls, whose main heroes are unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: What's that?
Roger, it's Sa Giger's calculator that helps detect radioactive minerals, such as the nebula.
And by listening to these listeners, you're hearing the presence of atoms that are radioactively charged with minerals.
Evans, tell me, this is really working right now.
Hans Gieger died in 1945 a few days before he was 63.
But the bullet that bears his name lives on to this day.
The new cancer reputation can teach the immune system to see foreign cells.
The new cancer reputation can teach the immune system to see and kill foreign cells.
As an integral part of the treatment, the anatomy teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells.
The meaning of the method is to take the immune cells from the patient and change them into lab rooms.
They will find many types of cancer proteins and then return to the patient.
The testing of a parathyroid shows promising results among cancer patients.
A woman who had been admitted to a registration that recognized the fake cells found that her ovarian cancer had disappeared more than 18 months later.
The purpose of the method is to take the immune cells from the patient and change them into laboratory conditions to detect many types of cancer called HER2 and then reintroduce those cells to the patients.
Professor Jay Berzovski of the National Cancer Institute of the United States in Meriland said, "Our results show that the honor is promising."
HER2 gene produces a number of types of cancer, including breast, egg, lung, and milk, explains Professor Berzovski.
The approach to detecting cancer cells from the patient has also helped to treat a type of leukaemia.
West, taking part in the Saturday Night Live (SNL), began the debate against the Drama.
It didn't work out well.
The Kenyan West crashed into the SNL studio when he began praising the United States. President Donald Tramp announced that he would be appointed by 2020.
He sang the third song that night, called the Urban City, with the title of the title America, and then began criticizing the Democrats and executing the Trump.
When I talk to the whites, they say, "How can you love Trump? He's a racist."
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd been away from America a long time," he said.
SNL began with his show Matt Dannon, where the Hollywood star was playing a video of Bret Cavano's testimony about the sexual violence of Christina Blaise.
Although it hasn't been shown, the video of the West was posted on social networks by humorist Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock did it to get Westy or not.
In addition, Wess complained to the audience, which was hard for him because of the capricious hat.
They made fun of me.
They said don't go out with that hat.
They set me up.
I'm in Paradise, according to Washington Examiner.
He went on, "You want to see the paradise," saying it, like he wanted to put on his superman's stick, as if it meant that no one could say, "If he does, you want to take the world forward."
"Try to love."
His comments angered the audience twice. SNL members were also concerned about the evening. Variety writes that even a man said, "The whole studio was stoned."
Wess introduced the singer's name to Ariana Grande, whose former partner died a few days ago.
The West confused many by singing the song "I Love" as Perrier Bottle.
Westy supported Canada's conservation team leader Thor, who wrote, "For one of the most vulnerable. Thank you for the support of the group."
Reporter Karen Hunter wrote that West was just what it was, and that's amazing.
"But I don't want to praise anyone by buying his songs, his clothes, or his art, when his ideas are dangerous to my community."
"She's free."
"We are, too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he changed his name and is now officially known as the Kenyan West.
He's not the first artist to change his name. He's following Didi, who is also known as Puff Didi, Puffi and P Didi.
Snub Dog has also been renamed Snub Lane, and the legend of music really changed his name as a symbol, and so did the archaic.
There's been an experiment at the Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man was arrested on Saturday in a restaurant in East Belfast with a suspicion of catching a man.
The police reported that the incident occurred in Balochamor.
On Monday, the defendant will be brought before the Belfast District Court.
The charge will be abolished by the prosecution.
The movie's star of the game of the horn is the body of a poisonous male. 2
Kit Haringon is known for its powerful role in the game of HBO Hall of John Snou in a violent fantasy TV show.
But 31-year-old actress broke Macho's stereotype, saying that these roles make the boys think that they should be treated with a sense of respect.
Talking to Sunday Times Culture, Kitt said he didn't think it was something, and he asked how to solve the problem of toxic manhood in the age of #MeToo.
Kitt, who recently remarried with 31-year-old Rosie Leslie, confirmed her determination to solve the problem.
"I think very much about where we've been wrong about manhood," he said.
"As we've taught men, they've grown up, and now we're seeing this problem."
Kit believes that television should be a part of the responsibility for teaching poisonous men in many of his male characters.
He went on, "What's born and what's gained?"
What they learn from television and from the streets that forces young men to become this kind of man.
I think this is one of the first problems of our time.
"Because it's definitely bad for young boys."
During the interview, he admitted that when the next summer the game of Gohre's film series ends, he won't play any more because he's tired of fighting fields and horses.
Since November, the whale has to play the nature of Sam Shephard's West, which is a story about the filmmaker and his stolen brother.
Darassan recently confirmed that the first good thing in the Gahr game was to meet his wife, Leslie.
"I met my wife in this film, and that was my future family, then the beginning of my life," he said.
In Emmy's fantasy television series, Rosie has been the body of Igrid, the favorite of John Snou's daughter, who was the body of Kit.
The couple married in Scotland in June 2018 at Leslie's home.
China's HIV/AIDS reports a 14 percent increase in cases.
China has announced 14% of HIV/AIDS sufferers.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the world, and they're taking the body of health.
Only 40,000 cases were recorded in the second quarter of 2018.
In contrast, most of the cases in the past have been sexually transmitted.
In some parts of China, HIV spread rapidly through infected blood.
During the conference in Greece, the incidents of HIV transmitted by the Chinese health bodies on the way have even been resolved.
But the number of people suffering from age-old HIV/AIDS increases by 100,000.
The sexual transmission of AIDS has become the main challenge of China's LGBT community.
1997 China rejected homosexuality, but discrimination against the LGBT community is considered unfair.
Because of the conservation values on earth, it's said that 70,90 percent of the men who are in contact with men will marry women.
The main reason for the transmission of diseases is unprotected sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to ensure the availability of HIV treatment to solve the problem.
Maxim Walter denies the release of data from the Grand Old Society senators, claiming they are dangerous lies and assumptions.
Maxim Walter of the United States sentenced the charges on Saturday as one of his staff members put personal data of three state senators in the Wikipedia of the legislators.
Los Angeles Domocrants have confirmed that the protests have been made by experts from extreme leftovers and web cookies.
"Truth, false, and evil lies," said Jitterin in his statement.
The collected information included home addresses and cell phone numbers belonging to the United States Senates from South Carolina to Lindsay and Watts from Mickey Lynn and Orie Tracking.
The information was posted by an anonymous person online on Thursday at Capitol Hill on the occasion of the Supreme Court hearings of the Bret Cavano sexual abuses.
Arthrus happened after the three senates examined Cavano.
The security sites Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP of the source of the messages matches the address of the Waters office, which was the source of information about the staff of Waters.
Votters continued that these unfounded charges were totally wrong and absolutely false.
My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been discovered as a result of these false and false accusations, bears no responsibility for the release of the information.
These unwarranted charges are totally wrong and absolutely false.
Votters' announcement was immediately criticised throughout the network. He was one of the advocates of the White House's former Mamlo Secretary, Ari Flescher.
"This is angry," wrote the bottler.
That means he doesn't want to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of a crime, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't be opposed.
He should not question the defendant's motives.
He needs to stay calm and calm.
Flescher compared Vatter's reaction to the criticisms of the Democratics of Judge Qavenoo, who were accused of being angry at the time of the three-week hearings.
In the election of the state candidate, Omar Navarro was trying to power Votters and was sharing his views on Twitter.
"It's good, if it's right," he wrote in a funny way.
In his statement, Watters said that his office had warned the relevant judicial bodies and the judiciary about these charges.
"We'll follow up on the fact that criminals will be discovered," he continued, "they will be fully responsible for their actions that have a dangerous and destructive effect on any member of my staff.
About Johnny English Strikes Again.
Now it's a tradition to look for Brexit in a new British-language film. It's like it's acceptable in the case of Johnny English activism, which started early in 2003 and came back to life in 2011 as Johnny English was born.
It's funny to think about the obvious source of national exports.
In any case, with a small eye, with a distasteful face, Johnny English received the second time of the lessensia, which means he's a song for non-English societies.
Vana, of course, is a stupid secret official, who, despite his miracles, looked a little like Clouseau, Mr. Bine, with his contribution to the 2012 opening of the London Olympic Games.
He's also originally based on a mysterious traveler and an international man on the character of Atikson, who has played in an already forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, creating a chaos situation behind him.
There's one or two beautiful moments in Johnny English.
I loved Johnny English coming up with a middle-class military suit and a helmet around which were turning around.
The physical cataclysmic gift of Atikson is shown, but the humor has lost its power and is considered to be too much, because it's already an ingredient in serious movies such as 007 and Unrealism.
Humor is more attractive to children than to adults. And I don't think Johnny English is beautiful and fixed like Bein's character.
Today, in fact, Great Britain is in serious danger.
The cyber features have entered the Internet data of British spies, revealing the identity of secret agents, replacing the official, which is a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop for a confused and persecuted manager who suffers from a political invisibility. Emma Thompson does the impossible in Teresa May, but there's nothing to do on the scene.
Counsellors say that since all the rumors are discovered, they have to bring one of the past.
This means returning to Johnny English, who is now teaching in a number of institutions, but at the same time teaches how to be a busy official.
He's back in England for a Whitehall quick conversation and joined his ex-wife's Buff, who plays Ben Miller.
Buff is now married and is an commander of Suzana, in the role of happy hockeyists, where Vicki Peperdin has a little weakened.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the secret service again, meeting with the beautiful woman of Olga Curlenko, Ophelia Bulatova.
While the manager has fallen into the trap of billionaire techs who believe they can solve British computer problems, Jack Lacey, who has played the evil part of Jason Walt.
English and Buff start a series of jokes. As a provider, they burn the French restaurant, make a mess in Volta. England organizes an internship using virtual reality audiences to see what's going on in Volta's house.
In the end, all the activities are clear, but because they were fun and interesting, there's a whole childhood TV about them.
It's pretty big.
Taking into account other films in English, I always wonder if British cinematography could give a role to Romanian Atticason, which would really be fair to his talent.
Leborists say they're planning a plan that says the British will work for 4 days, but they'll be paid for 5 days.
Germ Corbin's Leborist Society plans a plan that the British will work for 4 days, but will pay for 5 days.
The community wants companies to give their employees an extra day of freedom because of the presence of artificial intelligence.
It'd be good for the workers to have a three-day rest, but they'll get the reward for the rest of the day at home.
The sources say that this idea has entered the economic system, and is intended to transform the country into a work force.
The idea of a 4-day working week was established by the World Trade Congress, which is a good way for workers to benefit from economic change.
The spokesperson for the Leborist Association told Sunday Times, "The offer will be accepted by the end of the year.
It's not a problem to solve one day, but the idea of a four-day working week corresponds to the community's approach to maintaining economic balance as well as to the company's industrial warfare."
The Leborist community won't be the first to accept such an idea, because the Canauch community has also promised a 4-day work week throughout the 2017 campaign.
But this idea is not yet fully considered by the LeBorist community.
The spokesperson for the Leborist Association said, "The four-day working week is not a community policy, and is not considered by the community."
John McDonald had arranged a conference for the lesbians to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonald said he decided to review the division of government among poor managers and "debts" in community companies.
The water companies' distributions are also not going to get their share of the population, because the Leborist co-operative can make reductions by taking into account a number of shortcomings.
He also confirmed that he was planning 10 percent of the companies to make arrests and hand it over to workers who competed up to 500 euros in a public payment.
The Lindsey Gram, John Kennedy, told the 60-minute magazine that the search board would change its opinion about Cavano.
The investigation of the Bureau of Debit Investigations against Judge Brett Qavano has delayed the final vote in the Supreme Court for his appointment. The question arises whether the Bureau's conclusions may cause the public senators to fail to show their support.
During Sunday's interview, a 60-minute newspaper columnist asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the class bureau of investigations could make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more independent than his South Carolina partner.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said that I would participate in the hearings, I said that I had talked to Qavno.
I called him when the charge had already been filed, and I said, "You did it."
He was determined, without hesitation.
The gram is still silent like a fish.
"I have my opinion on Bret Cavano, and it's an unreasonable charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett's just denying it," added Graham, asking Christine Leslie Fordy.
"And all those that he points out can't confirm it.
This is a 36-year-old story.
I don't see any new changes.
What is the Global Civil Action and whether it will reduce poverty?
This week, New York will launch the Global Civil Event, the annual music event that is part of the wonderful sending of star groups to reduce poverty.
This is the 7th year that tens of thousands of people gather in the central garden, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Kardi Bei and Shaw Mendes, but also to talk about the fundamental purpose of the event, it's to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Civil Action launched in 2012 is the continuation of the Global Poverty Programme. It is an international protection group aimed at increasing the number of active combatants to end poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event, if of course you don't want VIP tickets, you have to do a few things, such as volunteering, sending the governing bodies to e-mails, making phone calls, and a number of other activities aimed at poverty eradication.
The Global Civilian has been able to achieve his goal.
Is it a good idea to reward people with a free ticket, that they just feel good about the idea that they can only send e-mails to change something.
Global citizens say that since 2011, 19 million actions have been undertaken by their partners for various purposes.
These actions are said to have helped call for more than $37 billion for world leaders, which by 2030 can change the lives of 2.25 million people.
In 2018, a group of 390 calls and applications were submitted, which has already raised about $10 billion.
The group reports that funding can be channeled directly to some 659 million people in the world.
In the United Kingdom, the food power was largely addressed by the Consumers, a company of investors who had the idea of developing the full power of children. After receiving letters from Global Citizens from 4,700 to 4,700, he promised Rwanda $35 million to end the complaint.
"We can, with the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments, and the Global Citizens, as well as you, in history, write about social injustices against corruption," said Ambassador Tracy Ulman at his live concert in London in 2018.
The group also announced that the Government has decided to finance the Food Force program to help provide 5 million women and children with more than 5,000 actions to improve the diet of mothers and children.
One of the most enjoyable questions on web sites is, "What makes you believe that we can end poverty."
The global citizen answers, "This is a long and difficult path, there will be both failures and failures.
Like civil rights and anti-circumvention movements before us, we'll be successful, because we're strong together.
Janet Jackson, Viking, Sean Mendes, Caddy Bin, Janel Mona, are among the stars that have come to participate in the New York event, whose guests are Deborah Lee Furnez and Hugo Jackman.
Minister of the Interior, "The United States can use the fleet to prevent Russian energy exports."
"If desired, Washington could use the supply of Russian energy to prevent its fleet, including the "neighbor of the Middle East," announced the United States Home Secretary Ryan Army, quoting Washington Examiner.
The army added that Russia's participation in Syria, especially when it's a legal invitation from the government, is a new candidate for new markets.
"I believe they sell their energy in the Middle East, as they do in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of solving it.
"The United States, with the help of our shipyard, has the opportunity to make sure that seabeds are open, and, if necessary, can block them to make sure that their energy will not enter the market," he said.
Zinken was addressing the participants who were hosted by the Power Sparrows, a non-commercial organization that represents him as the "song of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went to compare Washington's approach to cooperation with Russia and Iran, saying they were actually the same.
"The economic choice of Iran and Russia is less than much, instead of fuel," he said, representing Russia as a fuel-based economy "one-stoppered pony."
According to the announcements, the Trump regime carried out its mission to add liquid natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia with a more cost-effective option for European consumers.
As a result, officials of the Trump regime, including President Donald Trump of the United States, were trying to convince Germany that it would refuse the "incompatibility" of the North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, Berlin has made Moscow's "debt".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that, with $11 million worth of North Stream 2 that is built up to 110 square feet of gas power for redoubled, it's just an economic project.
Kremlin argues that being strict against Washington's plan simply has an economic basis and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we are unique in that energy cannot be a pressure application tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, after a meeting in Moscow with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry.
The U.S. position was opposed to Germany, which reaffirmed the stability of the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the German Industrial Federation (GAF), has encouraged the United States to stay away from the energy policy of Europe and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third side interferes with the supply of our energy," said German Industrial Federation (GAF) President Daetra Kempe, German President of Angola Merkel and Russia, Vladimir Putin, after the last meeting.
Elizabeth Warren will pay close attention to participating in the President's election in 2020, the Senator of Massachusetts said.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said that on Saturday after the election, he would pay close attention to the question of the presidential election.
In Hollywood, Massachusetts, at a meeting with the public, Warren said he was thinking about being proposed.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and correct our corrupt government, and that includes a woman in charge," he said, according to Hill.
"After November 6, I will pay close attention to the proposal for the president."
At a meeting with the public, Warren expressed his opinion about President Donald Trampy, saying he "takes this country in the wrong direction."
"I am very concerned about what Donald Tramp is doing with our democracy," he said.
Warren, in his criticism, expressed himself sincerely about Brett Quavin, the judge of Tramp and the Supreme Court.
On Saturday, in Twitter, Warren said, "Of course we need HDB research before the vote."
The Thursday question, however, showed that most of Warren's own trustees believe that it should not be proposed by 2020.
According to a poll conducted at the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe, 50 percent of Massachusetts's likely voters said that the senator should not be proposed.
Twenty-two percent were on the side.
The question has shown that former Professor Dave Patrick has more supporters, 38 percent have been on the side of his proposal, and 48 percent are on the other side.
Other important democratic names, which have been reached in the desire of potential proponents in 2020, include former vice president Joe Bedden and Senator Vermont Berne Sanders.
Byden said he'd make an official decision in January, says Associated Press.
At the Donald Trampy, Sarah Palin is talking about the subsequent stress disorder of Trak Pelin
Trak Palin, after his registration on September 26, spent a year in Iraq.
On Monday night, he was arrested and tortured for family violence.
"What goes through my son, through whom he goes back, I can talk to other families who feel the consequences of a subsequent stress disorder and the wounds that our soldiers are returning," he said to the public at Talsa, Oklahoma Donald Trump.
Palin called his arrest "the Philely Room" and said about his friend and other veterans that "they come back a little changed, they come back under stress, they come back, wondering if they will find respect for all that their soldiers and pilots and other members of the army have done to this country."
He was arrested in Vasila on Saturday, Alaska, and tortured for domestic violence against his wife, according to the report of the use of weapons under the influence of family violence and alcohol, according to the spokesperson of the Vasila Police Department.
The 18 states, Washington, are supporting the new asylum policy challenges.
Seventeen states and the Columbia area support the legal challenge of the new U.S. policy that refuses to provide shelter for those who have fled from criminal groups or family violence.
The 18 state and circuit representatives in Washington were briefed on Saturday as a judicial adviser to support the policy of asylum seekers, NBC News writes.
The visitor's full name is Grace V. Augusto, the list of applications against the American civil freedom union's class policy has not been discovered.
He said to his partner, "And the boys of his powerful criminal group," hurt him, but US officials refused to take refuge on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers in the state of Grace, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who provide a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, represented as nations that have persistent problems related to criminal groups and family violence.
The new policy of U.S. refugees was opposed to the 2014 decision of the Refugee Review Council, which allowed non-documented family-based immigrants to seek refuge.
In a statement on Friday, Columbia's leading judge, Carl Rass, said that new politics "is ignoring the law that exists for states, states and international decades."
"Physical law requires all asylum applications to be tried on the basis of clear evidence and circumstances, and such a prohibition does not maintain that principle," the court counsel said briefly.
After the reasoning briefly discussed the question that the policy of the influx of immigrants is damaging the U.S. economy, saying they are probably entrepreneurs and "needful workers."
Chief Justice Jeff Sessions ordered the interns to no longer give Union judges a refuge from criminal groups and family violence.
"The defence is for those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of racial, religious, ethnic, or special social group or political opinion," Sesion said in his statement on politics on June 11.
The agency has never intended to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems that people all over the world face every day.
In Palu, desperate efforts are being made to save the victims, because the deaths were doubled on the way to finding the fighters.
The situation was quite surprising for the fighters.
"It was very difficult," said a 35-year-old mother to Risa Cusuma, looking after her little boy in the middle of the bustling town of Palu.
"Every minute, emergency aid brings bodies.
The clean water is weak."
They've seen the inhabitants return to their ruined homes, take their goods from the dark places, trying to save everything they've found.
Hundreds of people were injured and 7.5 hospitals were filled with earthquakes.
Some of the wounded, including Devi Harris, who had broken their back and shoulders, were in the Palus Military Hospital, where the patients were being treated outside because of ongoing severe testing.
The tears filled her eyes when she told me how she felt when the strong earthquake shook the room of the five-storey hotel, which she shared with her wife and daughter.
There was no time to save us.
I was pushed under the walls, I think," Aris said to the Associated Press, adding that his family was attending a wedding in the city.
I heard how my wife called for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe.
The US envoy accuses China of alarming propaganda.
A week later, when China's official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the United States, commending China's trade surpluses every day, the US envoy in China accused Beijing of spreading the news.
U.S. President Donald Tramp on Thursday made a link to an addendum to the Chinese newspaper Des Moines Register, the largest-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, accusing China of inducing the US Congress' election on November 6th, the charge that China rejects.
The charges that Beijing was trying to intervene in the U.S. elections showed what US officials told Reuters, that it was a new stage in a escalating campaign to pressure China by Washington.
Although it's normal for foreign governments to place a commercial to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now in a worsening trade war, which has resulted in a balance sheeting of accounts on each other's stakes.
In the earlier phase of the Chinese trade war, the anti-fighting measures were intended to strike exporters from such states as Iowa, who had fought for the Trans-Traffic Republican Association, say American and Chinese experts.
In China, Ambassador Terry Brunsted of the United States, who went to China's largest agricultural product, former CEO of Iowa, said that China had hit US workers, farmers and businessmen.
As Bransted writes in the Sunday column of Des Moines Register, "In our own free press, China is now repeating this persecution."
"In the course of its preaching in Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is making use of the dedication tradition of freedom of speech and language in the United States," says Brencede.
"In addition, considering that the bill is under strict control of the Communist Community of China, here, in the paper below the Beijing street, you can meet a limited number of conflicting views and it is impossible to see the real reflection of the different views that Chinese might have on China's worrying economic path," he wrote.
He added that "One of China's most famous newspapers has been avoided" to publish an article from his proposal, although he did not mention what the paper is about.
Guanoo's narrators are insulting women's voters before the internal elections, warning analysts
But very high-level citizens remain in their position and defend the Brett Quanoo of the Supreme Court, despite several charges of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will face opposition in future internal elections, especially by women.
The feelings about this have been very intense, and most citizens have officially announced that they want to continue the vote.
"It's impossible to turn these things around," said Professor Grant Richer, professor of school politics at the University of Siracuse, published on Sunday in The Hill.
Riher said he suspects that Senator Jeff Flexis (Arisona) would be sufficient to reassure the electorate about the need to investigate the HDB.
"Can't forget what the night was, they won't forget it tomorrow, nor November," says the Washington newspaper, on Friday, said the senior advisor and national speaker, Karen Jean-Pierre, on the moveon.
On Saturday morning, when the Judicial Committee of Supervisors decided to propose to Quanoo a member of the Supreme Court, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise's Ford, the protesters in the midst of the Senate were shouting "November is approaching," says Mic.
"Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation will be huge," non-cooperative political analyst Steve Rottenberg told the news site.
"People say it's already high, that's right.
But it can be higher, especially for unspecified voters in extremes, as well as for 18-29-year-old voters who do not love the president, but often do not participate in the election."
Even the analysts before Ford's public testimony on sexual harassment against a member of the Supreme Court suggested that if the citizens decide to confirm his application, it could be a reaction.
"This has become a mess for the Republican community," said former president Michael Steel of the National Committee of the Republic, NBC News, at the beginning of last week.
"The speech is not only about the committee's vote or the final vote, but also about how the citizens have approached the issue and how they have shown their attitude," said Gai Cecil, who is leading the United States Priority Group, who is helping to select Democrats.
However, Americans seem to have a little bit of a split about who to believe after the demonstrations of Ford and Quanoo, and the number of recent performers for Ford has increased slightly.
Yougov's new question shows that 41 percent of the respondents are probably or are sure to believe in Ford's show, and 35 percent are probably or are sure to believe in Quano.
In addition, 38 percent think that Qavano probably lied in his demonstrations, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Fly's claim, the HDB is now investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford witnessed under oath before the Senate Judicial Committee that Qavano was attacked by drunk at 17 years of age.
Ramirez claims that the candidate proposed by the Supreme Court's office showed him his sexual organs when they attended a party at Eli University in 1980.
World Sardistina's author plans to create new networks to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Burns-Lin, a world-wide sardostine creator, opens a platform that will strive to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technological legend -- Inrupt -- is a company based on an open-source Berens-Li platform -- Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which information will be available.
In an exceptional interview with the Fast Company, Burns-Lini joked that the purpose of Inrupt was "to own the world."
"We have to do it now," he said about the lie.
"This is a historic moment."
The program uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own web store.
It can contain contact lists, lists of events, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at a time.
The particular feature of the personal data store is that the user himself decides who the information can be.
The company calls it "increasing personal rights and opportunities through data"
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Now the company is made up of Berners-Lie, Bruce, IBM's security framework, a number of software programmers who have admitted to working on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology makers around the world have been able to create their concentrated additions using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burns-Lin said he and his team don't talk to Facebook or Google about whether to make a complete change where their business models change completely in one second.
saying, "We don't ask for their permission."
In a paper published in Medium on Saturday, Burns-Lini wrote that Inrupt's "supply is to provide a commercial energy and ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of a new solid-based network."
In 1994, Burns-Lin transformed the network when he founded a Global Sardis Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lini has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even in the process of Inrupt, Berners-Lin will remain the founder and CEO of the World Sardistan Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm an unimaginable optimist for this next century," said Burns-Lin.
Bernard Van — A Great Priest of the First World War of Victoria
The only minister of the Church of England who won the Crusades of Victoria during World War I was raised in his hometown 100 years later.
General-Leitnant, Father Bernard Vann won this award on September 29, 1918, when he attacked Bellanglis and Leocur.
But four days later, he was killed by a rapist, not knowing that he was awarded Britain's highest prize.
On Sunday in Rushden, at Northhamptonshire, two of his grandchildren opened a memorial.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said, "It's too symbolic," that the monument will be opened to his grandfather, just 100 years after the award.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant General Bernard Van led his fortune to Kant St.Quentin, "through a heavy sword, and under the fire of the field forces and rifles."
Then he rushed to the fire and pushed the line "with the greatest courtesy," and then he took the field gun quickly and broke the three members of the army.
The lieutenant General was killed by the German duplicator on October 4, 1918, a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Van said that his grandfather's actions are "one I know I'll never be worthy of, but worthy of respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also put a flower on the floor following the performance of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Van said that "it's a great honor to be part of the hall" and added that "the dignity of the real hero is manifested in the support of many people."
MMA worshipers stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, but instead of seeing Josuk Pepppa
Imagine that you haven't slept all night, watching Bellator 206 walking at the gym just to keep you from seeing the main event.
San Jose was waiting for 13 single battles, including six majors, to be shown straight in the 5th wave in the United Kingdom.
At 6:00 a.m., at the time when Gerhard Musas and Rory McDonald were about to fight, TVmakers in the United Kingdom were surprised when they started showing José Peppha.
Many were not impressed because they had remained warm until the morning for a special battle.
One of the diplomats on Twitter described this transition to a child's movie as a "sacrifice".
"It's a state arrangement, according to which it's not appropriate at 6 o'clock, so they had to go through childhood messages," said Bellator, the senior editor of the marketing and communication line, Dave Schwarz, in response to the question of transition.
"Yes, Josuk Pepphova."
The president of Bellator's company, Scott Kocher, said they're going to work on their graphics so that the United Kingdom TV players can also be included in the future.
"When I think about the repetition, I think we can do it," Kuker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning, we can't do it until six o'clock in the morning, which is two weeks already.
But we're working in that direction.
Believe me, when the message changed there, there were a lot of messages, and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix the situation, and we thought it was a technical crop.
But it wasn't, it was a state-level problem.
I can promise you that this will not happen again.
We're going to reduce the number of 6 single wars to 5, as we usually do, we tried to give more to the worshipers, but we failed.
This is an emergency."
Desert Island Discs. Tom Dalee felt "low" because of sexual orientation
Olympian Swiss Tom Dale says he's grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but it has stimulated him to achieve success.
The 24-year-old teacher said that until I went to high school, they didn't realize that they weren't all like me.
Speaking on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, who was driving Lauren Lawyer for the first time, he said he had spoken about the rights of homosexuals to "hope" others.
He also said that after becoming a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, who has been driving a long-term show, has stopped for several months because of his illness.
During the first good news, Dale said that as he grew up, he felt inferior because “love for children and girls was unacceptable in society.”
And he said, To this day is the lowest and the lowest of the men that make me feel, and that they are able to make me feel good.
He said he wanted to prove that he was something from himself so that people wouldn't be disappointed, knowing about his sexual orientation.
The double bronze medalist of the Olympic Games has become a key defender of LGBT rights and has participated in the cooperation games held in Australia this year, calling for more countries to improve their unity.
He said it was expressed because his happiness brought him to live open, without consequences, and he wanted to inspire others.
The World Three Championship said that in 2013 a man, American filmmaker Dasty, was in love with Lance Blake, "hope" for him.
The next year, Dale married a senior director, who's 20 years older than him, but he says the age difference has never been a problem.
He said, "When you're so young, you're going through so much (he's been participating in his first Olympics at 14 years of age, and his father died of cancer three years later)," it was hard to find someone from the age who was going through the same adventures.
The couple became the parent of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Dale, and Dale says "the whole hope" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd say the whole goal is to win gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died of cancer at the age of 40 in 2011.
Dale said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked for was that if they were to win London-2012 games, he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Father, you won't be there to sit down in the first row'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only since he stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not safe," he said.
Next year, Dale participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the Bronze Medal.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life, to be sued in front of the audience of the Olympics at home, it couldn't be a better feeling," he said.
It also affected the choice of his first song, which was the Proud of Heiser Small, who accompanied him to prepare for the Olympics all over the world, and from which he is still crushed.
Desert Island Disks is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday, British time at 11:15 BST.
Michaelson, who is in a bad situation, is in a row of warehouses at the Ryder Bay on Saturday
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th game in the Rider Bay, but he'll have to work on his gym if he doesn't want it to be an accident.
The 12th time is going to be in a two-year competition, but coach Jim Fury left him in the storage room at the game that took place on Sunday.
Instead of being at the center of events, as it has happened so often, the fifth winner spent half of his day as a worshiper, and the other half working on his game at the gym, trying to fix what was bothering him.
The 48-year-old teacher, who wasn't even the best of the first hits at the top of his career, is not an ideal way for the narrow Le Golf National field, where riots usually punish the wrong hits.
And even if the field isn't so afraid of itself, Michaelson's playing on Sunday 9th will meet the British Open champion Francisco Molinary, who's teamed up with young Tommy Pitwood, winning all the games this week.
If the Americans, who're four in front of the 12 individual games, start well, Michaelson's game can be decisive.
Fury has given his boys confidence, not that he had more to say than that.
"She fully understood the role of her today, held her hand, hugged me, and said she'd be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
“ She has great confidence in her power.
He's included in the Hall of Farewell, and he's given so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I was planning more, but that's how it got, and I think that's the way we should choose.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Michaelson is going to cross the record of Nick Faldo, the biggest player in the Rider Bay.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Bay, which never really matches the heights of his individual signs.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 wins, and 7 no-one, even though Furick says his presence adds to the team's unimaginable.
"She's fun, she's sarcastic, and she likes to play jokes on people's heads, and she's a great teammate," he explained.
"I think young players have also had fun playing against him this week, and it was fun to follow him.
He's giving a lot more than playing."
Europe’s greatest Thomas Byron knows that the great advantage can soon disappear
The European elder Thomas Beorn knows from his experience that a significant increase in the speed ahead of the Rider's final game can easily turn into an uncomfortable course.
He played his first game in 1997 in Valderama, where the leading team of the Black Balesteros had a 5-unit advantage over the Americans, but the final score divided by a small difference: 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2:
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderama, where we lost, and in Valderama where we won, but with a small advantage," Byron said after watching how the 2018 team won 5-3 on Friday and the night, going through 10-6 on total Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone on this team that this isn't the end yet.
Tomorrow you'll show your best.
Come out and do everything right.
Nothing's finished as long as you have units on the display.
We aim to try to win this prize, and we focus on it.
I've always said that I'm focusing on our team's 12 players, but we also know who's on the other side, the best players in the world.
No matter how his players showed themselves in the golf course, Byron added, "I've never been too proud to do this.
Tomorrow is a full all-all-history.
Tomorrow is personal talk, and that's a whole different thing.
It's nice to be with your friend when things go well, but when you're alone, you're going through a whole trial as a golfer.
This is the letter that you have to get to the players, do the best you can tomorrow.
Now, leave your friend, who should do his best tomorrow."
In contrast, his partner, Jim Furick, expects his players to look better on their own terms than they did as a couple, except for Jordan Swift and Justin Thomas, who won 4 out of 3 units.
Fury was personally on both sides of these last day's rounds -- he was a member of the Brooklyn winning team, then he appeared in the position of the loser, and his father left "Medina's miracle."
"I remember every damn word of it," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw was the oldest to bring his players together in 1999 before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like us to go right before the beginning, as it happened in Brooklyn and in Medina.
When that motivation starts to work somehow, it exerts great pressure on those middle games.
We choose our composition accordingly and give the boys a chance to try miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to control the fight, he's going to meet Roy McKilrow, the other Europeans in the first half of the year, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Raham, Tommy Flywood, and Jan Paulter.
"I have chosen the boys in this direction, because I think this is the right class from the beginning to the end," said Byron about the players he selected.
Germany’s new military operation was delayed once again
The new Freight of the German Armed Forces had to be used in 2014 to replace the wartime combatants, but at least by the end of the year, it would not happen because of large systems and growing expenditures, local media reported.
Rheinland-Pfalz, the main operation of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, the military spokesman quoted Die Zeit as saying.
The ship was supposed to absorb the Soviet forces in 2014, but the worrying problems that arose after the delivery stopped the implementation of the legacy project.
The four ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg, which the Soviet forces had ordered in 2007, will come to replace the old Bremen Frigates.
It's supposed to be combined with a powerful satellite, a series of counter-air and accumulating missiles, as well as some of the secret technologies, such as reduced radio detectors, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer service hours: new fractals must be possible to accommodate up to 2 years from local ports.
However, continuing delays mean that advanced fighters, who say, will allow Germany to increase its influence outside the country, will already be old when they are given up for consumption, says Die Zeit.
The evil F125 frigates were found in the media headlines last year when the German Soviet forces refused to use the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipping company in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Soviet forces returned the ship to the shipping company.
There is little known about the reasons for the return, but the German press notes a number of key "grammatic and technical shortcomings", which would be useless if the war were sent to a military mission.
The programme was particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships will be served by 120 shipmates, which is half the crew of the former Bremen Freight.
And it turns out that the ship is very heavy, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the Soviet forces to make further improvements.
It's said that with 7,000 tons of Rheinland-Pfalz, twice as heavy as the same order ships that Germany used during World War II.
In addition to many devices, the whole value of the project, the retraining of the personnel involved, is also becoming a problem.
They say it's from the original €2.2 billion to the amazing €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problems associated with the new fractals are also more important in the light of the latest warnings about the weakening of German military power.
This year, President Hans-Peter Bertels, of the Committee on the Protection of the German Council, admitted that the Soviet forces are actually "stirring the ships that can be deployed."
The official said that the problem has grown over time because old ships have been taken off the grid, but they have not been replaced.
He complained that the Baden-Wuerttemberg members and no one could combine the Soviet forces.
National Trust hides the life of girls in secret.
A new study carried out in a mountain in Scotland is aimed at finding out how babies use landshaft when shooting food.
It's hope that the results will spread new light on the behavior of birds that fly alone and will help to maintain them in the future.
The research carried out by Scottish National Trust scientists will be followed by ordinary and post-natal girls, as well as by the red-haired and dobienton girls in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester-Ross.
Special recorders will be installed around the base of the challenge, which will follow the activities of the girls throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
The scientific analysis of all the recordings will reflect the frequency of the baby's sound signals, and will explain what species are doing.
Then a map of the natural environment and a report will be drawn to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
In the field of NTS conservation, Dr. Rob Duar hopes that the results will reveal that natural environments are more important for girls, and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of environmental governance, such as the creation of ants, and will help to figure out how best to conserve forests for small and other neighboring species.
The number of girls living in Scotland and the entire United Kingdom has decreased considerably over the last century.
They're in danger of construction and development, which affects the natural environments of girls.
Earth turbines and light can also be dangerous, as well as toxic papers and building materials and domestic cat attacks.
Girls aren't really blind.
But the habit of hunting at night makes their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes time to catch fish.
They're using a complex sound-location technique to find insects and prevent their flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings throughout the country, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land, is very serious for girls.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly do research, check the habitats, and sometimes perform rescue work.
The organization even founded the first and only ban on girls in Thrave, in the Damfis-en-Galway, where they live in 8 of the 10 species of girls in Scotland.
David Thompson, the leader of the estate, says that the estate is ideal for them.
"Here in Treve, we have a huge area for girls," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees, all of which are a good place to live.
But much is not yet known about girls, so the work we do here and in other situations will help us to better understand what it takes to make them thrive."
He stressed that it's important to check that there are girls or not and to do new conservation work inside the camp because the accidental destruction of one village can kill up to 400 females and young girls, so it's possible to destroy the entire local population.
The girls are protected, and killing them, persecution, oppression, or killing their babies is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferel, from the Scotland Children's Conservation Foundation, urged the population to gather to help them.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about girls, and we don't know how they live."
Ronald rejects allegations of violence, and lawyers are preparing to judge the German magazine
Kristian Ronald's charges of violence against himself have been described as "false news," saying that people want to "advertise themselves by using their name."
His lawyers are going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the statements.
The attacker in Portugal and Yuventus accused an American woman, Kathryn Maiorga, in 2009 of rape in Las Vegas hotel.
And it turns out that he paid him $375 000 to keep quiet about the incident on Saturday. He told Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the charges were made, Ronald, 33 announced "false news" in the video when he spoke to his 142 million followers.
‘No, no, no, no, no:
Today's what they say is false news," the camera said to the Golden Bundka winner.
And they will call on my name, because they have been a people for my name.
It's natural.
They want to be known by saying my name, but that's part of it.
I'm a happy man, and everything's very good," she smiled and added the player.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are going to trial Der Spiegel with the charges they call "personally unacceptable statements".
Activist Christia Sharz said that the player is demanding compensation for "the extent of the crime of psychological harm, which is probably one of the worst cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
It's said that the alleged incident occurred in the hotel room in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to the documents presented by the Nevada District Court, after a night band meeting, Ronald and Mayorga went to the playroom where he was probably raped.
Myorga claims that Ronald, after the incident, fell to his feet and told him that he was "99 percent" "good boy," that he made a mistake because of "one percent".
The papers show that Ronald agreed that the couple had sexual relations, but that was in mutual agreement.
Maiorga also claims that she went to the police and had pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to the trial without a trial because she was "feared of revenge" and did not want to "fear before the public."
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to stop that solution now, because she's still suffering the consequences of the case.
In the alleged indictment, Ronald almost joined Real Madrid in Manchester Union, and this summer he moved to a huge Italian juventus with a €100 million business.
Brixit: England, "I'll be forever" to lose car manufacturers.
England will forever be sorry for him if he loses his reputation as the world's leading automaker after the Brexit, said Economics Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was a 'disquieting' when Tooota, England, told the BBC that if the European Union left Angola without a business, it would temporarily stop production at its Darby plant.
"We need a business," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that without the Brixit business, border delays could cause job losses.
The production of fuel produced by Auris and Avensis in Tooota last year has produced some 150,000 cars, 90 percent of which have been exported to other countries in Europe.
"My view is that if England comes out of Europe at the end of March, we will stop production in our factory," said Marvin Kuke, an executive director of Toyoto.
Other English auto-production companies have expressed concern about how Europe will operate cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover without agreement.
BMW, for example, says that within a month after Brexit, it's going to have its mini output in Oxford.
According to auto-producer companies, their main concern is the risk of supply chains without a business in the case of Brexit.
Toyoto's production is based on the principle of "the right time" that, if ordered, parts of the cars come from England and Europe's suppliers every 37 minutes.
If, on March 29th, Europe leaves England without a business, there will be a cut-off, which, according to the producers, can lead to partial delays and deficits.
Tooto would be impossible to wait in his Derbishir factory for more than a day, the company said, and so the production would be stopped.
Mr. Clarke said that the Chequers programme for future relations with Therza May Europe "is clearly weighted to the limit without delay."
"We need a business: we want to have the best business that will allow us, as I say, not just to have the current success, but to take advantage of this opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4 today's programme.
"Not only to Toota, but also to other manufacturers, the evidence shows that we need to continue to have high-performance supply chains."
The pipeline couldn't tell when the production would stop, but warned that long-term added costs would reduce the performance of the product and, ultimately, reduce jobs.
Peter Chowalaris, who worked in Branaston for 24 years and was responsible for the Mass Union, said that his members were deeply concerned: "I think if such work goes away, they will never return."
The government spokesman said, "We have developed a clear and reliable programme of our future relations with Europe."
The meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House.
The important meeting of Donald Trump and the local prosecutor, Rod Rosenstein, could be delayed for another week, because the fight against Bret Quavinah's high court is continuing, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is following the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who is looking for Russia's intervention in the elections, the connection between Trump's assistance and Russia and possible violations of justice by the president.
The question is whether Dr. Tramp will be removed from the main prosecutor's office, and therefore the independence of Mullers will be threatened, and there has been an opportunity to spread rumors in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times announced that Rosenstein was talking about the possibility of recording talks with Trompy and the possibility of removing the 25th president directly.
Rosenstein rejected the announcement.
But last two weeks, he went to the White House on his refusal.
Instead, Thursday was announced to meet with Trump, who was then in the United Nations organization in New York.
The trump said he preferred not to leave Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Judicial Council, who was examining testimony from a woman guilty of sexual violence in Qavinah and her husband, Christine Blaisey Ford.
On Saturday, Tramp ordered the HDB to conduct a one-week investigation of Quainaha's charges, delaying the entire Senate vote.
Sara Sanders spoke on Fox News Sunday.
When they asked him about a meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "Not yet scheduled on the day of the meeting, it could be this week, I think it'll be delayed for another week, taking into account what's going on in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I always like to keep Mamula informed about the refreshments."
Some reporters disagree with that statement, and Sanders didn't realize the White House's asylum since September 10th.
The reporter, Chris Wallans, asked why.
Sanders said that there was no objection to the "show behavior" of the TV reporters, but he said, "I don't deny the fact that it's show behavior."
Then he said that the direct link between Trump and Mamuli would be widened.
"The president participates in more questions and answers meetings than the other presidents before him," he said, without indicating any evidence, we've been looking for those numbers.
Asulis will continue, Sanders said, but "If the press has a chance to ask the U.S. president straight questions, it's better than talking to me.
We've tried a lot to do that and you've seen that we're doing it over the past few weeks, and it's going to happen again at the Mamuli sallis, where you'll be able to talk to the president of the United States."
The trumpet regularly answers questions when it comes out of the White House or participates in an open meeting or a press meeting with senior officials.
So it's very rare that a person's jaws happen.
This week, the president in New York revealed why he had a sense of urgency and sometimes unusual behavior in front of reporters.
The Minister of Health writes to the employees of NHS Scotland in Europe about the concerns about Brexit.
The Minister of Health wrote to the employees of the EU of NHS Scotland that they would be grateful for the country and their desire to remain in the area of Brexit.
MSP Jane Freeman sent a letter that six months after leaving England.
The government of Scotland is already willing to accept the expenditure of the state of affairs of the citizens of the past European Union in its public services.
In his letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between England and Europe have continued, leading to the decisions that are pending this fall.
But the government of England has also promoted its preparation, without the possibility of a business option.
I know this will be a very bad time for all of you.
That's why, I want to remind you again and again how much I value the contribution of each member of the workforce from an independent nation.
Entrepreneurship and other areas bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health work, and benefit the patients and the public who are being exploited by us.
Scotland is your home, and we want you to stay here."
Cristia's taking Abercomb's surgery fast after head injury.
At the time of the loss of Vanderbilt Commodore 31-27 after the loss of his head, Christine Abercombi, who was in the state of Tennessee, announced that he had a rapid surgery.
Master Professor Rod Reid of Tennessee told reporters that the damage was suffered shortly after the semi-final.
"She crossed the side line of the stage and looked like she was fighting there," Rid said.
Teachers and medical staff gave the oxygen to Abercomb in the side line before moving him on the messenger and sending him a subsequent scan.
In Tennessee's official Nesville, Tennessee WSMV told Chris Harris that Abercomb is being operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet about the type/level of the damage" and the state of Tennessee is trying to figure out when the damage has been done.
Abercomb, who has been a second player for two years, is performing his first race in Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five games before he got out of the game on Saturday, which added a total of 18 games to his season.
Foreign buyers will pay more for the brand when they buy something in England.
Foreign buyers will pay more for the brand when they buy something in England with the extra money that Tori's new plan is to help the homeless.
This step will undermine Corbin's desire to attract young voters.
The interest rate will remain for those who don't pay in England.
The Treasury plans to increase by £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will pay more for the brand when they buy something in England with the extra money that is intended to help the homeless today, Teresa Maye.
The path will be seen as the success of Corbin's young voters in the attempt to neutralize their desire to secure more affordable housing and make promises to those with high incomes.
There will be a rise in interest for people and organizations who don't have to pay in England, which will protect the government in order to fight the problems of the homeless.
The extra fee that is added to the current registration fee, including two years ago, to pay a second house and a vacancy, could be equal to three percent.
The treasure department assumes it's going to bring £120 million a year.
13 percent of the newly built property in London is purchased by non-English citizens, who raise the price and make it difficult for buyers to get to the apartment for the first time.
Very rich areas of the earth, especially in the capital, have become "urban cities", because of the large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time outside the city.
A week after Boris Johnson's tax cuts, a new policy will be applied, which will allow more young people to buy their first apartment.
He accused large construction companies of taking over land but not using it to keep the buildings high and convince Ms. Maye to make house arrangements available to solve England's "misleading housing problem."
Mr. Corbin has announced a series of house-surveillance improvements, including the monitoring of the institutions and the completion of the "crime" of the trial.
He also wants to give local self-government powers to build new homes.
Mrs. Maine said, "In the past year, I said that I would work to restore an English dream that life would be better for any new generation.
And that means to fix the broken market in our houses.
England will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it can't be right that it's as easy to buy a house for non-EU and non-EU organizations as it is for British citizens who work very hard.
For many people, the dream of having a house becomes more inattentive, and the contempt of being silent becomes more real."
My main goal is the government of Scotland.
The leader of Sanderland, Jack Ross, says that his "main objective" is to become the ruler of Scotland in one phase.
Scott (42) enjoys the North-East team reconstruction challenges that are now taking third place in League One, remaining with three units.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, calling last season with St. Mirren the Scottish champions.
"I wanted to play the game for my country as a player.
I got a B hat, and that's it," Ross said to the BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
But I grew up with my father when I was a kid in Scotland, and that was something he always kept with me.
That would only be possible if I were a successful team leader.
As Sanderland's managers, Ros's predecessors include Dick Advocacy, David Moses, Sam Alodys, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kein, and Paolo de Canion.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says he doesn't feel any concern about following such a large group of people who have previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"The success will be measured for me at this moment, so that I can return to the Premeier League."
Because of the structure and possibilities of this team, it's definitely the Prime Minister's League.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I'll probably see my success only if I can get the team back there."
Ros is only three years in his manager's career, in Dubartton, as a deputy director, and in the hearts leadership team after 15 months.
He then helped Alloa recover after a third degree descent, and changed St Mirren from descent to the next season called the winner.
And Ros says he's feeling better now than ever in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic in his player's career.
"It was probably a real choice," she said about taking over Alloa's responsibility.
I honestly believe that the government was right for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I played well, and I make a good living out of it, as well as enjoy some important heights.
But playing can be difficult.
There's plenty of things you need to go through during the week.
I'm still going through all of this in terms of stress and pressure, but the government is more spiritually sensitive.
I've always wanted to rule, and now I'm doing it, and I feel much more comfortable than what I've done in my entire adult life.

According to the research, it's a great time to drink on the Sabbath at 5:30 a.m.
Summer heat provides income for England's struggling good, but it also adds more pressure to the restaurant's networks.
According to the figures, well-being groups have 2.7 percent sales growth in Julis, but restaurant revenues are down 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from the CGA Business Advisory Society, who had discovered the data, said, "The ongoing heat and the world's leading part of England -- the long-awaited participation -- forced Jules to also follow the example of June last month, when the profits of the goods increased by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants that were more damaged.
The fall of 1.8 percent of the restaurants in June has worsened with Julis.
Drinking to the good and the bad made it work better than reducing the work of restaurants.
Food also reduced the labor of the apple in the summer, but not as bad as the work of the restaurants.
It looks like people just come out for a drink.
The sales of beans and beans increased by 6.6 percent in a month, and the food decreased by three percent.
Paul Numan, from the RSM analysis of entertainment and hospitality, said, these results continue to be the idea we've seen since the end of April.
And the impact of social and sports events is still the biggest factor when the word goes from house to house on sales outside the market.
It's not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the decrease of the sales volume of 4.8 percent of the year will particularly affect the current highest costs.
The long-term heat summer could not have been worse for food producers, and in time, would it have been easier for August to find a room to rest in.
The overall increase in sales of beans and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, affecting reductions in brand investment.
Coffer Peach Tracker has collected and analyzed the results of the activities of 47 working groups that had a total of £9 income, and it's a defined indicator.
One out of five has a secret social media account that she hides from her parents.
According to research, one out of five children aged 11, has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of insta pages.
That news strengthened the fear that sexual information is spreading.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a basic account to show their parents.
One of the 11-year-olds is creating social media accounts that are hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth of fake Insta pages, connecting them to the Instagram website.
That news strengthened the fear that sexual information is spreading.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a clean "core" account to show their parents, while at the same time having personal accounts.
A mother who has discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret site has discovered a young man who convinces others to "violate her."
The research conducted by the UK Digital Awareness and the HMC found that 40 percent of 11-18 years of age have two accounts, half of which are recognized as having a personal account.
HMC leader Mike Buchenen said, "It's disturbing that so many young people are tempted to create a network where parents and teachers can't find them."
Ellie Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" in the advice of Scotland's athletics.
Ellie Doyle was elected a non-profit manager at the Scottish Athletic Council, at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most respected light athlete in Scotland, and President Ian Biddi said that this is a good way for sports authorities to benefit from her international experience in the last decade.
"Elily enjoys great respect between Scotland, England and the world, and we are confident that he will benefit greatly from counseling an Italian in Scotland," Biddi said.
Doyle said, "I will work with great love as an athlete's sound, and I hope that I will really be in trouble, and I will help control the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 and 400 meters in the 1996 games in Atlanta, has a total of four Olympic Oscamedals, and now the BBC's permanent interpreter, has lost his ability to walk since the last Islamic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I was hit this day.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I were going to get rid of it and to what extent.
It was hard work, but I was completely healthy, and I learned how to walk again, and now I'm doing motion exercises.
Thank you for encouraging messages."
The Christmas pump advertisement that compares mothers to cows spreads off the net.
The Christmas pump company has a net view of a advertisement that compares the feeding mothers to the milk cows.
So to present the so-called "first-world silent-sucking pump," the consumer technology company Elvie released a lightweight music video, which shows what freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of cows, under a song that has words like, "Yes, I love you, but you don't see nothing." And, "If you didn't see them, they weren't my daughters."
The band said, "Get them out of here, get them out, I feel them, little ones, get them out, get them out, I give them to my masters."
However, the ad posted on the company's Facebook page, online, has been a subject of debate.
With 77,000 diots and hundreds of comments, video viewers have received different reactions, many of which say it mocks the "fears" of dairy production.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and have a baby, except that they don't steal their children a few days after they are born," said one person.
Elvie's wedding pump is placed in the food broiler (Elvie/Mother).
Another commented, "It's understandablely harmful to mother and child."
But, yes, why don't you use them to advertise to the mothers who buy them to keep their children?
Another said, "What kind of advertising isn't related to reality?"
Others have defended the ad, a woman has admitted that she says the song is "very fun."
I think that's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breast-feeding.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I accepted it the way it was presented for.
"This is a wonderful product," said someone.
Another said, "It's a fun announcement that impresses mothers who stay (well at their place of work or at their place of work) and feel like "who."
This is not an ad that praises or criticises the production of milk."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that everyone was dancing with hidden pumps.
The idea of preaching is based on the idea that a lot of women who have their breasts are feeling like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is quite voiceless, has no string or tube, and an invisible house is placed in the food vent, which allows a woman to move free, hug the child, and even leave the house.
Ana Balarin, the ECD and Mother's partner, commented: "Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that was worthy of power and power publishing.
We wanted to focus our attention on breast-feeding and all its challenges, in a fun and relative way, showing the unparalleled sense of freedom given by the pump.
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump appeared in the center of attention.
During the London fashion week, two mothers appeared on the Marta Yakubovski stage, using the product.
Hundreds of immigrants moved slowly to the tent camp in Texas.
Despite the fact that the monthly divisions of the border remained relatively similar, the number of newly discovered immigrants has increased rapidly, partly because of the fact that the strict policy presented by the Trump workforce has made it difficult for children to be supported.
Usually, many supporters themselves were undocumented immigrants, and they were afraid to risk being able to stay in the country because of demanding children.
Risk grew in June, when government bodies announced that the most likely supporters and the older members of the house would have to present their fingerprints, and that these data would be transmitted to the authorities involved in the issues of immigrants.
Last week, Matthew Albens, the Head of Immigration and Tax Services, presented to Congress that the service had arrested dozens of people who had asked to support single children.
Then the service confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no previous trial.
"Approximately 80 percent of the people who are supporters or members of their families are illegal in the country, and a significant part of them are criminals foreigners.
So we're still looking for these people," said Mr. Albens.
To investigate the children more quickly, officials introduced a new law that could require them to appear in court within a month, instead of 60 days, which was the former standard, according to the residence, the workers.
Many will appear through videoconferences, instead of presenting themselves, to the judge of the immigrants to legalize their case.
Those who don't meet the requirements will respond quickly.
According to the refugee workers and the reports received from the system over the last few months, the longer those children stay in detention, the more likely they will become a source of water or a stress that can lead to breakthroughs and escape attempts.
Experts say that this concern is greater in areas such as the Tornillion, where it is easier to see the suffering of children as a result of being large.
They added that moving children to a city of refuge, without making them physically available or giving them a chance to give up their friends, could put them in harm's way, with which many are already suffering.
Syria tells the United States, France and Turkey to take back the "occupational forces".
In the wake of the United Nations General Assembly, Prime Minister Valid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been fighting for eight years.
Mualem, who is also an alternate, said that foreign forces are illegal in the Syrian region, fighting terrorism, and that they "should be treated accordingly."
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions," he said to the Assembly.
Mualem claimed that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue, saying, "This is the holy battle, until all the regions of Syria are cleansed," both from the fear one with another, and from the presence of the lawless.
The United States has approximately 2,000 military officers in Syria, who mainly teach or advise the heart forces and the Syrian Arabs, who oppose President Bashar al-Asad.
France has more than 1,000 military personnel in the country.
Speaking about refugees, Mualem said that the conditions for their return were good and accused the "certain Western countries" of spreading interpretative fears, which keeps refugees away.
"We have called on the international public and humanitarian organizations to contribute to this return," he said.
"They're political about what must be a purely human issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not support the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Asada and its opposing forces.
The U.S. biologists say that the final agreement on the creation of a buffer zone in Idlib, between Russia and Turkey, has created an opportunity to promote political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive attack by Russian forces on the state where 3 million people live.
But Mualem stressed that the agreement "has clear deadlines" and hoped that military action would be relieving the jihadists, including the Nusra strikers, who would be "killed".
The United Nations envoy Stefan de Mistura is hoping to soon invite the first branch of a new committee of government and opposition representatives to develop a constitution for post-war Syria, leading to a smoothing of elections.
Mualem presented the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee's contributions, saying that the mission should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the present constitution" and warned against interference.
Why the Drama Will Win the Second Hour
With that reasoning, Mr. Drump will be elected in 2020, as there is probably hope that many liberal TV viewers, impertinents and scandals will soon stop his presidency.
This will, of course, be "the most tragic end of the presidency ever."
At this point, there's no fatigue in the television area.
Since 2014, rescue timers have increased more than twice in CNN to 1.05 million and tripled in MSNBC to 1.6 million.
Fox New has an average 2.4 million free-time viewers, which exceeds 1.7 million four years ago, says Nilsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is headed by 3.5 million viewers during the main news evenings.
"It's a fire that people are trying to do, because it's something we don't understand," said Neil Bayer, the ABC's "Designed Survivor" movie, a film that tells about a government member who becomes president after the attack breaks out in Capitol.
Nell Scoowell, author of the Comedian Veterans, wrote, "Only funny events, some of the harsh truths about the invasion of Hollywood boys," but there's a theory.

Of course, in the wake of everything on television, the musical lines coming from Washington can determine the future of Rowe Against Wayne, regardless of whether the immigrant families can join and whether they can benefit from the global economy.
Switching off is a beauty that can only be allowed by the most visual TV viewers.
And yet, it goes beyond the limits of being informed, when you follow for 6 hours how a group of experts are discussing the use of the "unexploded" sources for his "not-for-printing" book by Bob Woodward, the $15,000 worth of Paul Manafort's worth, as Washington Post and Storm Daniels, Dr.

When I called Mr. Flashy this week, 80 degrees out of his house on the northern coast of Caua, but he was watching MSNBC sitting at home and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't drive himself out because Brett Qawanon was going to meet the Senate Judicial Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court depended on the hair.
"I remember when we were doing these crazy shows in time, people were saying, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," Flash told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Other money flows to the palace’s quick selection of representatives
It's not surprising that there's a great flow of money to Pennsylvania's 17th election, thanks to the reorganization of elections, which results in two members of today's House of Representatives fighting for one chair.
These recently reorganized Pittsburgh civil election competitions took place in the Democratic People's Republic of Palestine today, Connor Lemb, who was elected in the last spring of the election.
Lemb competes with another Congressional, Republican Keith Rotfus, who is currently representing the 12th election in Pennsylvania, which is essentially consistent with the 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided last January that the former elections were inextricably for the benefit of citizens.
In the 17th election, the competition led to a competition between the Democratic Advocacy Committee (DCCC) and the National Advocacy Committee (NRCC).
Lemb became known in Pennsylvania after he won a little bit more in the 18th election of Pennsylvania in March.
For ten years, the chair was occupied by the public, and President Donald Trampp won the election with 20 units.
Political experts give a little more to Democrats.
U.S.A. took the opportunity to punish Salvador for doing so to China, and then stopped.
Biographers said that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already known Pekin, and they had little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Tramp met with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he also had a hotel in Panama, until the partners threw away the Trump Organization's government team.
The government officials decided to call together the leaders of the American diplomatic missions from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, due to the latest decisions about not knowing Taiwan, as declared earlier this month by Ptep's spokesman, Hesser Noort.
But the prosecutions were intended only against Salvador, which had received about $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, which included a reduction in financial assistance and a reduced limit on entry visas, would be painful for the Central American country, its high level of crime and crime.
The next meeting was held in parallel, North and Central American officials delayed a high-level convention dedicated to the safety and economic development of the country and followed a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward for migrants in the United States not to be allowed to travel.
But by mid-September, senior officials of the regime realized that they wanted the convention to continue, actually putting an end to Salvador's thinking of punishment.
It is now expected that Vice President Michael Pens will be giving a speech at a conference to be held in mid-October, signaling the importance of that meeting by the board of directors, the demonstrators said.
Three American diplomatic representatives returned to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without any new sharp signals or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's speech refused to comment on the details of the discussion, which were described by three American officials, including two biographers, who agreed to talk about internal discussions, provided that their name would not be published.
Their evaluations were confirmed by an analyst on one side of the board, who also spoke of the non-disclosure of the name.

The next step can be the Special Prosecutor's report, Robert Muller, on the prevention of justice by Trump, which is very significant in public documents.
It is said that Mr. Muller's investigation leads him to see if the tramp's preferred campaign has made a secret agreement with Rustan when he attacks our election.
If there's a change of government in Congress, Mr. Tramp will be called upon to take responsibility for the structure, just as he's going to meet the electors again, as well as, possibly, socialally, equal to the haters.
So there are a number of "if" and I have no intention of assuming that the fall of Mr. Trump or his colleagues in Europe is inevitable.

Ranger Graham Dawns was optimistic before the Rapid Vienna conflict.
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against Austria, which followed the impressive results of Spain and Villareal at the beginning of this month, will put them in high positions to qualify as Group G of Europe League.
Because of the damage to the knee, Graham Dorans was unable to participate in his first race in the season until the Villareal 2-2, but he believes that Rangers can use it as a major asset.
"It was a good time for us, because Villareal is on the right side," said a 31-year-old.
And he said, We have begun the game, believing that we shall achieve one thing, and we shall achieve it.
Maybe we could take it at the end, generally, the result of no one was probably fair.

Despite the fact that research participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to care, few of them talked to their family about it.
Nearly half of the nationwide researchers say they're talking to their husbands about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said he was talking to his kids about it.
"People want to take care of their family members, but they don't take steps to make such a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Business.

You also have your financial advisor, and your advisor can help you find ways to pay for these expenses.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia.
At least 384 people died as a result of a severe earthquake and tsunami that shook the city of Palu, Indonesia, on the day of Urbat, the officials said, and there is still a rise in deaths.
Due to the loss of telecoms, the assisted experts have not been able to obtain any information from Dongalla, which is the area north of Palau, which was the closest to the 7.5-balancing epicinthrin.
In Palau, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palau and Dongalla.
Palu Central Sulawesi is the capital of the island of Sulawesi, located on the west coast of the island, estimated by 379 800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongala is more than 300 km (180 miles) long on the north-west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, which is the administrative district, has a population of 299,200 estimated in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the cornerstones of the central Sulawesi economy, especially for the coastal region of Dongala.
Nice mining is also very important for the area, but it's mostly centered in Morowali, opposite the Sulawesi coast.
According to Indonesia's Oils Fighting Office data, Palu and Dongala have suffered several times in the last century from tsunamis.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by tsunami and hundreds were injured in Dongala.
Tuna also damaged Dongala's western part in 1996 by killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific mountainous region, where earthquakes occur on a regular basis.
These are the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: The main earthquake on the West coast of Indonesia's Aceh region occurred in northern Sumatra on December 26, which affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The series of severe earthquakes jolted the west coast of Sumatra at the beginning of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, not far from Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 The Balan earthquake shocked the northern part of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, which led to tsunamis in the south, killing about 700 people.
2009: 7.6 The quake struck the capital of the West Sumatra area near Padang.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: 7.5 The earthquake struck one of Mentawai's islands, near Sumatra, which led to the formation of about 10 meters of tsunami, which destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The Vergetinian earthquake shocked the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, causing disruptions and terror, as it reminded people of the deadly and devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
In this case, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died because of the flow of buildings.
2018: The major earthquakes jolted the Lombok island of Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The tension destroyed hundreds of buildings and thousands of tourists.
Sarah Peelin's eldest son was arrested for family violence.
Trek Peelin, the former governor of Alaska and the former vice president, the eldest son of Sara Peelin, was arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old resident of the city of Wasilla, Peylin, was arrested with a suspicion of interference with family violence, family violence, and opposition during the arrest, reports a weekly report published by the Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when one of the female acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she picked up the phone.
Peelin is in Man-Su's solitary confinement and is kept under $500 in custody, tells KTUU.
On the Sabbath day, he stood before the age where he was asked to accept the badge, saying, "It's certainly not a crime," the network said.
Pilein's threatening three classes of A, which means he can be arrested up to one year at a time and injured $250 000.
He's also charged with Class 2 crimes, which is punished by a daily prison and $2000 fine.
This is not the first time that we have criminal charges against Peylene.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Peylin.
His mother, Sarah Pellyn, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is now being examined in Alaska's "Veterans Court."
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, domestic violence, and armed in an unprecedented manner.
Her friend claims to have struck her face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticised Sarah Peylin after she linked her son's violent behavior to a postpartum stress disorder, which was the result of a service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia — hundreds of victims
On Saturday, at least 384 people were killed as a result of the earthquake on the island of Sulaves.
7.5 The earthquake caused tsunamis to destroy thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks have broken down, and the number of victims is likely to increase in the next few days.
Earthquake was recorded not far from the centre of Sulawesi, north-east of the capital of Indonesia.
The video on social networks shows the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered in Palu to participate in the beach chorus when the tsunami struck the shore.
The D.A. calls on the New York terrorist suspect to be executed, which is rare.
In New York, class judges are demanding a death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, who is suspected of a terrorist attack that took 8 people's lives. This is a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state of 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov was allegedly attacked by a truck hired by the Home Depot on the northern Manhattan side of the highway, hit by footmen and riders on the road.
To justify the death penalty, the defendants will have to prove that Saipov has killed 8 victims and that he has caused serious physical harm, says the New York South District Court, in an announcement of intentions.
According to the legal document, in the case of two articles, the death penalty is possible.
Several weeks after the attack, the sworn haters assaulted Saipov, presenting 22 charges, including eight charges of murder, for murder, which criminals usually use in cases of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of cars.
The attack called for "planning and observation of circumstances," the prosecutors said, describing the way in which the Saipov's bread was served as "a cruel, cruel and immoral."
"Syfullo Habibulievich Saipov has damaged and lost Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Anne-Lore Decadti, Darren Draiti, Ariel Erleigh, Erna Feruchi, Erna Diego Mendos and Alejandro Damian Pragunuchio," says the news of the ideas.
Five of the victims were natives.
The court in the South of New York has been charged with the death penalty for the last 10 years.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, accused of murdering two drug dealers and sentenced to death.
For the last time in New York, the death penalty was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ether Rosenberg, the married couple were sentenced to death after they had been recognized as guilty two years ago by Sarah for the sake of the Soviet Union during the war.
The Rosenbergers were both sentenced to death by means of an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to judicial documents, Uzbek's citizen Saipov did not show the scene of conscience days and months later.
Police say he's told the investigators he feels good about what he's done.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that the attack was inspired after watching videos of the Islamic State on the phone.
He also asked the Islamic State to hang the flag in his hospital room, says the police.
He didn't recognize him as a criminal in the 22-year-old conviction.
One of Saipov's piano public defenders, David Patton, said they're "evidently disappointed" by the decision of the prosecution.
"We believe that the use of the death penalty, without being acquitted of the right to sin, will only serve as a relief for all participants in the surrender events that took place," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked lawyers not to be sentenced to death.
The Guardian of the Society says that the responsibility of the Brexit talks should be placed on NAIL FARAGE
Today, Nigel Faraz vowed to "mobilize the army of people" during the Thori conference.
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Association said that politicians should "sympathize with the warmth of the Europeans," as one of Terza May's messengers suggested that he be responsible for negotiations with the US.
Peter Boone, a member of the Conservative Association's regular council, told the roadside members in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "now be out" if Mr. Faraz was the minister of Brexit.
But Theresa May's challenge to reconcile its strictly fragmented ranges was more stressed in the US after the Tori side, which is against Brexit.
The president is trying to maintain his counter-attack plan, which is named Shashaki.
The students claimed that he would continue his efforts to reach agreement with Brussels, despite the reaction, thus forcing the Euroskeptics and the Leborists to make a choice between the package he proposed and the "Caose."
Mr. Ben said at the "Department means leaving" protests that he wants to "abstain from the shed."
He suggested that Mr. Faraj become a partner and that he be responsible for talking to Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we'd be out by now," he said.
The representative of Wellingboro added, "I'm going to fill out Brexit, but we're going to have to give up the box."
Presenting his opposition to the EU, he said, "We didn't fight in world wars for him to be dependent.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bon rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, the public opinion changed: "The idea that the British have changed their opinion and want to remain in the US is completely wrong."
Andrea Jinins, a Brexit-side guardian, who was also on the street, said to the reporters, "I'm just saying, Master, listen to the people.
The "Frankaut" does not enjoy great democracy, the opposition is not prepared to vote for it, it does not enjoy the unity of our community, as well as the activists who first go out the street and choose us.
Please turn away from the Teacher, and you will hear."
In a bitter statement addressed to Ms. May, she added, "Teachers keep their jobs if they keep their promises."
Mr. Faraugh said that street politicians should have to "smooth heat" if they stand at the end of the 2016 decision.
"Today, this is a question of confidence between us and people and politicians," he said.
And he said, They are trying to sell Brexit, and we are here today, to say unto them, We will not leave you to eat.
He added, "I want you to feel the warmth of our political class at the end of the Brexit deal.
We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country, who has dedicated us to our victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become independent, self-government and proud of the United Kingdom."
At the same time, the supporters of the U.S. spent two hours in the center of the city.
Some of the activists were covering the Tori signs against the Brixit signs after the last group this week was formed.
Leborist L. Adonis mocked the conservatives when they opened the conference on security issues related to their partner's cell supplement.
"These are the people who tell us that all TT technologies can have Canada Plus Plus, to have a free trade limit with Ireland," he added.
"This is totally fresh.
"There's no good sense in Brex," he said.
Werner plans to propose in the presidential elections
The U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after November's election, he's going to be able to "record" in the presidential election.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat in Western Massachusetts was talking about his future at a town hall-shaped gathering.
President Donald Trampy's permanent critic, Warren, offered his bid for the election in November and will appear against the representative of the State Association Jeff Dil, who served as a co-founder of the Massachusetts event in 2016.
Ascetics are turning around, possibly, he's in the 2020 network of challenges.
On Saturday afternoon, his 36th meeting with the electorate in Hollyok was held in the Town Hall format since he became president.
One of them asked if he was going to propose an invitation to the president's office.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington and restore the corrupt government, including the highest position.
The LSU's firearm has been arrested by murder.
On Saturday, Baton Ruzh's police in the state of Louisiana announced that on Saturday, LSU's basketballist Wade Sims was suspected of being arrested for murder.
Baton Rugh's police department announced that at 11 a.m., 20-year-old Diton Simpson was arrested.
They released the shooting video on Saturday, asking for help to identify the man in the middle of the recording.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the school district of the South University on Friday morning.
"Weid Sims has suffered a head injury from a gunshot and eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press through 247 sports on a weekly basis.
Wade has intervened to protect his friend and have received a bribe from Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the scene and armed and confessed to shooting Wade Simpson.
Simpson was arrested without interference and confined to the West Baton Rouge Police Department.
The third grade student Sims, who was raised in Baton Rugh, was in the third grade at 6 feet (1.98 m), attended the 32-game season, and the average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 minutes, and 2.9 times.
The Russian novelist, Louis Hemilton, is approaching the world champion's stage when the team championship gives him victory over Sebastian Wetley.
From the time that Walter Bots got ahead of Louis Hemilton on Saturday, it became clear that team competition would play a major role in the race.
One of them, Bots, got a good start and almost hit Hamilton, holding his position on the first two rounds, urging him to attack his team.
Wetell first appeared in a bad situation and allowed Hemilton to face the crumbling team -- something that had to be decisive.
Mercedes later entered the circle and went out after Bethel, but he moved on to the corner, and the ferry driver stepped out of the inner road to protect the third corner after taking a double step at risk.
Max Ferstapien started from a line behind a single network and was the seventh on his 21st birthday at the end of the first cycle.
And then he was the first in most of the race, and he wanted to get close to the fast end, and then he went over to Kim Reekconen to take the fourth place.
He finally got back in the mid-44s, but he couldn't speed up the remaining eight, while the fourth came in.
It's a difficult day because Walter worked fantastically throughout the weekend and allowed me to pass as a gentleman.
"The team has done such an extraordinary job, with one count of two," said Hamilton.
The language of the body proved to be very difficult
President Donald Tramph laughed at Senator Diane Finnstein when he claimed that Christine Blaisey Ford, the Supreme Court prosecutor, had not circulated a letter accusing Brett Quanoo of sexual harassment.
During a speech in West Virginia, the President of the Senate's Legal Committee did not directly address the demonstration given by Ford, commenting on what is happening in the Senate, indicating that people are "sick and armed and liar."
"One thing that could happen, and the only wonderful thing that happens in the Senate in the last two days, when you see anger, when you see angry people and the wicked and the knight and the liar," he said.
"When you read the messages and the spread information, they say, "Oh, I didn't do that.
I didn't."
Do You Remember?
Diane Finnstein, have you spread the information?
Remember his answer -- did you spread the paper, "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spread it."
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we just -- "No, we didn't spread," he added, like the senator?
In July, a letter containing charges against Ford was sent to Finland, and earlier, in September, it spread, but Finland denied that its office had spread it.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't spread his story," the Finnish committee told The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret and I did her request."
But his refusal did not like the president, who commented on the race that took place last week: "I tell you, the language of the body was very difficult.
Maybe it didn't spread, but I've never seen anything like it in the body language."
In continuing to protect the Supreme Court's appeal, the president suggested that democrats use these claims for their own purposes.
"They're willing to take the government with all the necessary means.
You see wickedness, violence, it doesn't matter to them who will be harmed by them to gain power and control," the president said in a message from Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Uncle Duyer hit two bullets on the Giants team against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars team took off after the Elite League team lost Saturday, winning a 5-3 match in Denmark on Saturday.
The Giants, thanks to the beatings of Patrick Doyer and Francis Bowley, received an early two-gol advantage.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kauun equaled the bill, and then Duyer restored Giants's advantage.
Francesua Bushar evened the bill for Dundee, and then Lucas Lanvald Neils' Golls won the victory for them.
It was Elite League's third win for the Adam Kiff team, who took the lead in winning Dundee 2-1 on Saturday night in Belfast.
It was the fourth session of the season, and the Giants team won the last three games.
The first round of the two was 3:35 minutes from Kendal McFol's pass, and David Ruttford took the pass, and Bollier doubled the increase four minutes later.
In the first round, Salvador changed the play course for the owners of the field at 13:10 and then, with the help of Matt Markudt, it was at 15:16.
Thanks to the Duiers, Giants' lucky team took into account when he hit his second round at the end of the first round of the night.
The Dashti's owners were reorganized, and Bushur re-balanced their count, mostly at 27.37 p.m.
Craun and Charles Corcoran were joined by helping Nilsen to provide the first advantage for the Dundee team at the end of the second round, and he did everything he could to win his team in the fifth round.
The Giant team, now lost four of their five games, returned to Milton Chains' house, and are preparing for their next game on Saturday.
Air traffic rate dies by saving hundreds of aircraft passengers from an earthquake
In Indonesia, the air traffic system has been declared a hero since it took all the means to make hundreds of passengers fly safely.
More than 800 people have died, and many are considered to be the result of a massive earthquake on the island of Sulawes, which has caused tsunamis.
There's a lot of people under the roofs in Palu, and there's a lot of people under the roofs.
Twenty-year-old Antonio Gaana Agung refused to leave his guard from the stormy air force of the Mutira Ces Al Jufrei in Palu City, despite the fact that his colleagues were running away.
He stayed in his position and did everything he could to get the number of Batik Air Flight 6321 on the plane at the time.
And then he jumped out of the train station when he thought it was going down.
Later he died in a hospital.
According to Australian ABC News, Indonesia's Voice Navigation spokesperson Johannes Sirett said that the decision might have saved hundreds of lives.
We've organized a helicopter from Balikapapana to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, until he reached Pala.
"Our heart was moved when we learned about it," he added.
At the same time, authorities believe that the death rate could have reached thousands, and the country's island response agency says that the entry of the cities of Dongala, Sijje and Botong is limited.
"It is possible to increase the number of dead, because there are still many bodies under the roofs, and some of them can't be removed," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The six-metre-high waves destroyed Palu, where a mass launch will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft come to the aid and the necessary facilities.
Her 35-year-old mother said to Lisa Cusuman Sky News, "Every minute, she's bringing bodies.
Pure water is low.
The mini-shoes are stolen everywhere."
In Indonesia, the leader of the International Red Cross, Jan Gelfand, told CNN, "The International Red Cross is speeding up to help everyone else, but we don't know what they're going to be doing there.
This is a tragedy, but it can be worse."
On Sunday, Indonesia's president, Joco Vidodo, arrived at Palu and the country's armed forces, and said, "I ask you all to work day and night to carry out any assignment related to the removal.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
This year there was an earthquake in the city of Lombok, Indonesia, killing 550 people.
Air Niguini says there's a missing person in the ocean after the plane.
Now, the airline operating a plane lost in the Pacific Ocean of Micronesia now says that one person is missing, and earlier it said that all 47 passengers and crew at the airport have been successfully taken off the plane.
Air Niugini said there was a lack of a male traveler on the weekend.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators trying to find a man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the request for more details about the traveler (the country or nation).
The local ships helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane tried to land at the Turk Island Airport and hit the water.
On Saturday, the authorities said that seven people had moved to the hospital.
The airline said they were still in the hospital on the 6th day of the week, and all of them were stable.
The reason for the fall and the sequence of events is still not clear.
The airline and the U.S. Air Force both say the plane is down at sea, not far from the flight.
Some locations think the plane's out of the airfield.
American traveler Bill Janes said the plane was too low.
"It's too good," said Janes.
Janes said that he and the others were able to get into the water at the crash exits of the crashing plane.
He said that the dissidents were terrified and that he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Air Force said that the ship repairers near the ship also helped rescue operations, bringing people to the shore before the ship was about 30 metres (100 feet) below the water.
Aviation safety data shows that in the last two decades, 111 people have died as a result of aircraft crash in Papua New Guinea, but none of them belong to Air Niguini.
The narrator represents the night of the woman’s murder
On Saturday, the court re-examined a man who burned a woman living in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Analyst Paul Roulette has been a witness expert for hours in the field of investigation.
He presented to the haters how he used cell phone records to bring in a 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' moves that night, and the baby killed her.
Roulette said she had received information from a few cells that showed that Teles was with him the night of Chambers' death, which contradicts his earlier claims, reports The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was on the side of Campbell's phone when he said that his friend Michael Senford was with, the police went to talk to Senford.
Senford testified from a van for the Witnesses that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Telis was right that night that he had spent the night in the Senford truck, Senford said he was "a liar because my truck is in Nesville."
Another inconsistency is that Telis said that he had known him two weeks before he died in Chambers.
Cell phone records show that they've known each other for a week.
Roulette said that shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis had deleted his messages, phone calls, and contact data from his phone.
"She's taken him out of her life," said Heil.
The protective side should start presenting its concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the defendants on that day.
The High Breed.
A hip-hop three wants to challenge the negative attitude of the music style by filling their music with positive links.
The High Breed Group claims from Bristol that the hip-band has gone far away from its ability to solve political issues and social problems.
They want to go back to their senses and make the conscious hip-cluster public again.
Artists like The Fugees and Commons have recently been reborn in the United Kingdom through such artists as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
The bridesmaid's court gives the couple a sentence to get out of work after the "racist" message.
The bridesmaid's play gives the couple a trial to get her out of the job in a different way after receiving a message from the wrong address, which says she's "one more black."
Husbands deny that they're racist, and they're comparing the claim to "strengthening."
The mother of two children was alarmed by Linsi Plasco-Flexman, knowing that the new children's dance, Giselle Morris, was black when she came into work the first day of 2016.
"OOOOOOOOOK, WE'RE SEVAMORT," Mrs. Plasco-Flexman wrote in a message addressed to her husband.
But instead of sending her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing his mistake, the "unsightly" Plasco-Flexman released Morris from work, saying that their current African-American dance had worked badly and that he was a Filipino waiting for New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid for one day's work and sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is going to judge the couple, demanding a payout, and expecting a $350 payout for every six months, for which they had been hired to live in the workplace, even though they had not signed a contract.
"I want to show them what you see, don't do it," he said to Post on Saturday, adding, "I know that it's discrimination."
The husbands responded to the charges of racism, saying that it was wise to get Morris out of work because they were afraid that they would no longer be able to trust him after he was hurt.
"My wife sent him something that he didn't intend to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist people," Joel Plascon told Post.
"But would you trust one of your children to whom you were angry, even if it was wrong?
Your baby.
Give it to me."
Plasco said that his wife had only two months ago had a child and that she was in a very difficult situation.
"Are you going to pursue someone like him?"
"It's not that good," the investment bank added.
Although the case is still pending, the court of public opinion has speeded up criticism of husbands on social networks, condemning them for their behaviour and reasoning.
Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers would not be tied to the speaker's ring, revealed in a new letter.
Bondy's daughter Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says about the letter: "It's hard to imagine you're the first person to read it before it's published.
It's very fun to know what we know today about the huge success of Paddington."
Said his father, who worked for the BBC operator, until he was encouraged to write a book about a small cow, added that the 60-year-old publication of the book had a different feeling after his death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, whom he considered to be "an important family member", he added that his father was quietly proud of his likely success.
"He was quite calm, and he wasn't a proud person," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it's almost like having a child who's succeeded, you're proud of it, though it's not what you did.
I think he felt that way to some extent the success of Paddington.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he had the habit of offering Paddington worth it."
My daughter was dying, and I had to give up on the phone.
Immediately after the surgery, his daughter moved to Niss Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors were invincible to save his life.
"Ned called regularly to say that everything was really bad that he couldn't overcome it," said Ms. Edna-Lapéruz.
"Then I received a call from him who said, 'For a few minutes, I will set him at rest.'"
And I gave it.
I said, "Well, I love you very much when I love you.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors gave to keep her heart working, slowly losing their strength and getting out of her body.
He died a while ago, and that was the end of it all.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that this is not going to work out.
I couldn't scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to keep me together."
Finally, Mrs. Edna Lapperouz, who was so far mourning the loss of her daughter, but he and the passengers took a plane, forgetting the test she was going through.
"No one knows," he said.
"I hung my head, and my tears were poured out all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was flying, I had an infinite sense of compassion for Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
The grieving women wrote an open letter to avoid suicide.
The two women who lost their loved ones as a result of suicide are working to prevent other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamphreys wrote open letters in Welsh, with exciting calls and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Miss Davis' son Taylor was 13 when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," he said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Sydney, said that his son was a promising meal with a contagious smile.
They all knew him, for they were wont to mock him.
They always said that his smile would light up the room."
However, he left his work before he died, because he was "very dark."
In 2014, Taylor's brother, then 11 years old, had found his brother himself after his suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly afraid that this will have devastating consequences."
Ms. Davis made the posters "to inform people that there are people who can meet and who can talk to, even if they're friends.
Don't be silent. You need to speak."
Miss Hamphreys, who has been Miss Davis' friend for years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother died.
"She didn't say she felt bad or depressed or something like that," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in her behavior.
He was very sick at birth, and when the children opened their arms, he didn't look at their eyes, nor did he see them."
He said that his death was a great shock to them, but they had to overcome it, "It leaves a deep impression on the family.
It just destroys us.
But we all have to resist and fight."
If you're struggling to resist, you can call the Samaritans 116 123 for free (English and Ireland), e.g. post jo@samaritans.org, or visit the Samaritan website here.
Brad Kevinha's schedule depends on the hair, because the HDB is starting to search.
"I think if we could really find what he wanted, the investigation has a limited time, a limited space, we could reach unity," said Mr. Fleigh on the Sabbath, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be broken up into military terms.
Why is Mr. Kevinhan and his Republican supporters looking for HDB?
Their dissatisfaction is only about time.
It's only five weeks left for mediocre elections, which is November 6, if, like expected citizens, they fail, their attempts to select any person in the highest court in the country will be substantially reduced.
George V. Bush took the phone to call the senators to get them to lobby Mr. Kevinan, who was working for the White House, and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What's going to happen after the D.D.B. report?
There will be 51% of the population in the Senate, 49% of the population, and 49% of the population.
It's not clear if Mr. Kevinan will be able to get 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to achieve equality and establish himself in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's legal violations have decreased in Kim's time.
The number of violations of North Korea's laws has decreased, as Kim Jong Yun came to power seven years ago, the North Korean legal body said.
Park Byeong-seug, reading the news from the Northern United Ministry, said that last year there were 1127 legal offences compared to 2706.
Mr. Park said that the tighter control of North Korea and China border and the higher taxancies were an important factor.
Pyongyang didn't make any public comments.
From the north, the majority of lawmakers finally get South Korea's citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally cut the border after the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Many are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and which is easier to cut than the well-protected armed district (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China treats refugees as illegal migrants, but not refugees, and often returns to their homeland by force.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is still technically warlike, has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss ending the use of nuclear weapons.
This was followed by a historic meeting between President Donald Trampy and Kim Jong Won in Singapore in June, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-weapon-free island in Korea.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Prime Minister, R. Jongy Hoon accused the US of skanks, of reducing their success since the day they were applied.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot trust our national security and under such circumstances, it is impossible to declare a single-handed soldier," said Mr. Rin New York at the United Nations General Assembly.
Nancy Pelosi, Brad Kevinhin, says he doesn't fit in with the Supreme Court.
The chairman of Nance Pelos, a minority of the House of Representatives, called Brad Kevinhin of the Supreme Court, and said that he was not in a position to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelos made these comments in Austin (Tekash) in the glory of Texas Tribune on Saturday during the interview.
"I couldn't help it, but I think that if a woman ever does that, she's called hysterical," the Senate Judicial Committee told Pelos about her reaction to Kevin's show on Thursday.
Kevin emotionally denied the charges that he had been sexually assaulted by Christine Bleese's Ford when they were both young.
In his opening speech, Kevin was very emotional, sometimes very angry and screaming when he was talking about his family and school years.
He also openly accused the committee's citizens, calling the charges he was charged with, "Funny nonsense," organized by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton was defeated in 2016's presidential election.
He told Pelos that he thinks Kevin's show proves he can't work in the Supreme Court because it shows that he's against the citizens.
"I think he has failed with these signs and his attitude towards Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
He was tortured when he was asked if he would try to accuse Kevinan if his application was confirmed, and if the images were made by the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say that if he doesn't tell Congress or HDB the truth, he doesn't match not only the Supreme Court, but also the court where he is now," he said to Pelos.
Kevin is now a judge in the Washington Investigation Court.
Pelos added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about the possible decisions of Kevinan against the Accessory Health Act or the Rou Wade Conflict, because he is considered a conservative justice.
In hearing about his statement, Kevinahan avoided the question of whether he would change the rulings of the Supreme Court.
"Now it is not the time for a man who is a Jew or a Greeko to go to the judgment seat and to be expected to say, 'What is great'," he said to Paul.
And the woman has to master it.
It's just criticism, the anger of months and years goes out, and he can't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Mrs. Steinman 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, do I?
And he said, "The woman who was the manager of the place, who said she was crying when she was angry, but she worked on a plot that assumed that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the man she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was great."
The sounds are permitted to let go, in particular, of anger, because they're basically misunderstood.
One of my greatest memories of work in an office where men were proud of it was when I caught myself one day crying out of unfathomable anger, a woman of my age, a cold manager, one of whom I was always a little scared, grabbed me out of the woods and gave me a ride to a boarding school.
"Don't let them see you cry," he said to me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think that you are sad, and are glad that they have grieved you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with President Harry Hart in the election.
In 1987, when she was arrested by a woman on a Monkey Business ship and charged with extramarriage, she got tired of the competition, and the choir was disappointed, Mrs. Schroeder thought that there was no reason why she shouldn't be able to participate in the election.
"It wasn't a well-balanced decision," she laughed 30 years later and said to me.
"There were already 7 participants in the electoral struggle, and there was another one that was the last thing they wanted.
Someone called it "The White Fish and the Seven Birds."
Because it was the late stage of the campaign, he was with him for the money collection, and he swore he wouldn't get into the fight if he didn't get $2 million.
It was a struggle.
He found out that his favors, which would give the man $1,00, were only giving him $250.
"What do they think I'm going to get?" he wondered.
When he spoke, saying that the official campaign was not going to begin, he was so overwhelmed by emotions (thank you to the people who had killed him, to the system that made it so complicated to collect money and to select, not to frame orders, to be angry about sexual violence).
"It was possible to think that I had a nervous disorder," said Mrs. Schroeder, recalling how Mamul responded.
"It was possible to think that Kleinex was my corporate supporter.
I remember thinking, "What's going to be written to my grave?"
"She's crying."
Like the U.S.-China trade, the war can be committed to China.
The first battles between the US and China were overwhelming, and the fight between the two countries could benefit China in the long term, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Tramp warned early this year of the ban on China's shells, including solar stations, copper and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was this week, when new auctions were put in place, affecting the total value of $200 million (£150 million) -- in fact, it was imposed on half of the U.S.-owned products from China.
Payin has given a corresponding answer every time, in the last few days, 5-10% of the tax on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to respond equally to the United States, and the world's second economy is difficult to escape in the near future.
To force Washington back to meet the demands, but public submission to the U.S. president of China would be too embarrassing for Ce Xinpe.
However, experts claim that if Beijing is able to use its games correctly, trade pressures from the United States can have a positive impact on China's long-term prospects, reducing the linkages between two companies.
"The fact that sudden political decisions in Washington and Beijing can create conditions for economic closure in both countries is in fact more dangerous than the viewers had previously acknowledged," said Abigail Regries, a researcher who is involved in the new U.S. Security Center on Asia issues.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says the inventor
Syria says it's ready to return refugees and seek help in rebuilding the land that has been destroyed by war for more than 7 years.
Speaking at the U.S. U.S. General Assembly, extraordinary Valid al-Mualem said conditions are improving in the country.
"Today, as a result of the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation is more stable and secure," he said.
To restore natural life, the government is continuing to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists.
Today, all conditions are in place to ensure the return of refugees to the country that they have left because of the economic sanctions of terrorism and the only one who had an impact on their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country after the war began in 2011.
Another 6 million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the loving regime would welcome help in restoring the destroyed land.
But he said it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe’s victory at the Rider Bay in Paris
In 2018, the European team won the Ryder Bay by defeating the US team 16.5-10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris.
The U.S. is now losing six times in the European field, and none of the riders that took place in Europe in 1993 have won.
Europe revised the title after the Danish senior Thomas Byron team won the 14.5 unit needed to pay off the United States.
American star Phil Nickelson, who fought almost throughout the race, sent the ball into the water after the 3rd shot, at the 16th of the game, to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shined out in all the rounds, becoming one of the four players who have won 5-0-0 since 1979.
The American Jordan Spitty left the Danish Thorbour Olsen, the most successful player in the European team, 5 and 4.
The world's most significant player, Dustin Johnson, rejected English Polters 2 and 1, who may have been in the Raider Bay for the last time.
The Spanish singer Sergio Garcia, a member of the Wat Ryder Bay, became the largest winner of all the competitions in Europe.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't stop me today.
This was a tough year.
Thank you so much for choosing and trusting Thomas.
I'm so happy that we've returned the trunk.
It's about a team, and I'm happy that I was able to be useful," Garcia said excitedly after the European victory.
He's handing over the lock to his native John Rami, who lost the U.S. golf legend Taiger Woods on Sunday.
"I feel unimaginable pride after losing Tiger Woods, I grew up watching his game," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France, and now it's a 13-21-3 record.
It's a different statistics for one of the most famous players who won the 14 main titles, only to Jack Niclaus.
In addition to Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level games throughout the race, the entire U.S. team was suffering last week to find ways.
The U.S. senior Jim Fury, after the team's disappointed game, said, "I'm proud of the boys, they fought."
One moment this morning, we put pressure on Europeans.
We're broken.
I'm pulling my head in front of Thomas.
He's a genius.
His 12 players showed up very well.
We're going to reunite, I'm going to work with the American Association of Professional Golf Players and the Rider Cave Committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their oldest.

Refreshment of the Red River: The concentration in Pinellas, Manats, and Sarasota has decreased
The Florida Fish and Rural Conference announces that the red river concentrations in the Tampa Bay area are generally reduced.
Under the circuit agreement, reports are received on active flowering in the areas of Pinelas, Manathi, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Coley, which is evidenced by lower concentrations.
The flowering of the red wave is about 130 miles (208 km) from the northern Pinellas to the southern districts of Li.
You can see a few details at 10 miles (16 km) from the Helsboro district, but less rarely than last week.
There was also a Red Wave in the Pasco area.
Last week average concentrations were seen in or near the Pinelas, from lower to upper concentrations in the Hilsboro region, from the phone to high concentrations in the Mant region, and in Sarasota and western regions, from the phone to mid concentrations in Charlotte, from the phone to high concentrations in the LI region and lower concentrations in the Cole region.
Pinellas, Manats, Sarasotas, and Lis still record respiratory explosions.
In the last week, there was no report of respiratory explosions.
