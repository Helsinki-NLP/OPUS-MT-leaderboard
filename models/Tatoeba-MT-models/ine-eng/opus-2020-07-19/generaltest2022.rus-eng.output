In my view, the literature programme was formed by women of the age of Balzakov on the basis of their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred the Danish and the Volconian.
They wrote a ballet, of course, in terms of the same women of the Balzakov age.
And the psychology and torture of Tolsto and Turgeneva heroes for teenagers is not so interesting.

Thank you very much, very interesting.

Matras Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Micropacket Prestige model: comfort and natural composition.
In the matrix, the thickness of the sides is different: the medium to hard surface is formed by a latexed coconut fiber and a natural latex, moderately soft, a plate of natural latex.
The spring block with 1000 spring per square meter is quickly adapted under the sleeping body, warning of the effects of the "voltaic" or "gamak".
Among the dignity of the model, breathing materials should be allocated.
Latex, perforated for air pressure, is perfectly ventilated in a natural way, as well as in a coconut.
As a result, a healthy microclimate remains in place.
An extended warranty period is also extended to mothers.
The period of official guarantee from the manufacturer – 5 years, for the period of operation of the matrix more.
The protection against dust and contamination shall be placed on the bulkhead of the jacket placed in a set.

Germany: The fourth strangulation from the coronary virus is inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
In the opinion of the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final but will continue with a new force.
Despite an active campaign in Germany, no two or three doses of a coronary virus vaccine will likely not be sufficient for full protection.
In this, the head of the Association of Doctors of the General Practices of Ulrich Weyheldt is convinced.
On Saturday, 11 December, Die Welt reports.
"We expect the fourth vaccination to be required by summer, at the latest by autumn," says the expert.
In addition, Wiegeldt hopes that the fourth coronary virus vaccination will be possible “in combination with influenza vaccination”.
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help to combat the spread of the new strain of Omicron.
The new option is particularly dangerous.
So, the probability of reinfection of Omicron three times higher than in Delta or Beta strains.
The results of the preliminary study conducted in the UAR show this.
Consequently, manufacturers of BioNTech / Pfizer are planning to provide a vaccine adapted to Omikron by March 2022.
The companies stress that two doses of vaccines do not provide sufficient protection against infection with a new version of the Omicron crown virus.
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that the effectiveness of the two doses of the vaccine is significantly below: “the neutralising potential is reduced more than 25 times”.
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against micron-stamp infection," stressed BioNTech and Pfizer.
A third dose is therefore required.
Experts insist on speeding up vaccination in the country.
For example, the president of the German Infectious Disease Society, Bernd Zalzberger, advocated a reduction in the interval between the second and third appointments.
As Zaltzberger believes, the accelerated vaccination will have an impact on both the delta virus and the micron variant of the coronary virus.
"The experience of Israel is very convincing," stressed the expert.
Vobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 years old.
Bet-A-Vib series is a special Bet-A family plant from Pontoon21®.
It (as in the Kalikana Vib series) differs from the number of other outbreaks because it was originally created with the use of tidal fishing, not only for the seine fishing.
These rashes are larger than those close to the likes, with a distinct weight, which certainly has a positive impact on the nuances of the use of these interesting baits.
Another feature is the upper surface of solid and narrow plastics, creating additional vibration biases in vertical and horizontal channels.
As a "winter vibe" when caught in Bet-A-Vib, it demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
The most frequently catchable is simple monotonous animation, that is, the movement of the fan up-down almost without a break.
When planning a deviation from the vertical axis, it is not very large, which is convenient for fishing in a restricted area, which is damaged by underwater vegetation, by roots and other obstacles that can be blocked.
In addition, there is a slight deviation in winter fishing and in the winter, especially in the middle of the winter, when precise and aggressive take-off is required.
Upon reaching the end of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib is instantly devolved and returned to the reference vertical.
At least Bet-A-Vib has been successfully applied for the winter fishing of the primordial forage.
You can choose from two modifications: with or without a sound capsule (NS-NanoSound) (SL-Silent).
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib game in captivity is capable of dissipating a passive touch that does not even react to live.
The Bet-A-Vib trap shows the length and accuracy of the catch.
This wabler is understood and not capricene, it is well combined with a leather and a leather thread, even with large diameters.
To catch sharks, turtles, eagles or hawks other than equal to the current and "steps" sometimes with "knocking" at the bottom.
If you're hunting in the corners, you can turn the front triangle into a double, which will reduce the probability of the traps.
In the middle of its Bet-A-Vib class, among the most sustainable in the work and, as a result, one of the most catchable.
With the same success, it can be used both in relatively small and deep areas.
All models are equipped with the Owner ST-36 screws.

In Libya, 7 thousand Russian mercenaries reported
There are over 7,000 employees of private military company (CHC) Wagner in Libya.
On Sunday, 12 December, the President of the High Council of State of the Republic of Haled Al-Mishri said that.
"There are currently more than 7,000 employees in Libya at Wagner.
They have planes.
They also run transits in Sirte and Kufre.
They have 30 reactive aircraft at Gardabia (also used as a civilian airport in Sirta),” said Anadolu.
Haled Al-Mishri also pointed out that the Russian mercenaries were "trying to seize" the central part of Libya, extending from Chad to the Mediterranean, after "bringing their own person into power" in the Central African Republic.
_Other Organiser
According to the publisher, Moscow sought a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “placed in Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, uses the air base and port in Sirte, as well as the aviation base in Jufre, is noted in the Agency's publication.
The Russian authorities formally denied that the Wagner CWC was supported by Kremlin.
Where else can there be mercenaries?
According to the agency, Wagner is allegedly operating in nine African countries -- the CAR, Libya, the Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licences for the use of useful fossil and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to those countries," the article states.
According to the media, "wagonists" were allegedly fighting in Donbasse, Syria, Mozambique, the Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not significant in the force departments, nor in the legal register, and its fighters are not present in the formal lists of personnel.
This company is under US sanctions.
In the past, 27 EU countries had previously approved restrictions on Wagner.
This decision is expected to be adopted by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of Libya de facto is the Second Chamber of Parliament with consultative functions with the dominant Islamists in it, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the transmission of a single day ' s vote on the election of parliamentarians and heads of State since 24 December at least on February 2022.
“The election remains for less than two weeks, and the chances that they will be overdue are rapidly reduced,” notes the paper.
In this regard, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates for an indefinite period, reports Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy with Russian eyes
38 per cent of Russians see more success in foreign policy than failure, 29 per cent believe that failure prevails.
"The indicators of success - "have protected Syria, restored peace there," "a decision on the North Stream-2", "the whole world feared that the cool weapon," "We're sorry about the cream."
The main failures are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with the Western countries”, “exclusion from the world”, as stated in a study of the Public Opinion Fund.
The Government of Dubai has completely rejected paper production - all services have also become only digital
The Government of Dubai reported a complete rejection of paper production and the transition to digital technology.
All public services will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the WAM Emirat Information Agency.
"Today, the beginning of a new phase of the encryption of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a totally unstoppable government," said the successor prince of the Emirates, President of the Dubai Executive Board, Sheikh Hamdan Ben Mohammed Ben Rashid Al Maktum on Saturday.
The internal and external documentation will now be conducted only in digital form through special information platforms in all Dubai hosts.
The innovation has affected all sectors without exception: health, CZC, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures have also joined the Government initiative.
The transition to the electronic Government and the digitization of the document has begun in Dubai since 2018.
At the time, according to the authorities, there were 336 million papers, representing 14 million hours of human labour and $353.8 million in cash equivalents.
Former Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobianin said that electronic services would save citizens 2 days a year.

Production and export of Turkish cars fell below 2020
The production and export of Turkish cars fell sharply in November in front of the pound.
As a result of the 11-month results of the industry, Bloomberg reported a worse result, referring to data from the Association of Automotive Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were released in November in Turkey, 20 per cent less than a year earlier.
Approximately 75.9 thousand cars have been exported, with more than 25 per cent of them falling within the last year.
And if, as a result of the first 10 months of this year, Turkey ' s car sector has shown a positive trend for last year, 11 months in 2021, the car issue was already 0.3 per cent worse last year.
The drop resulted in a sharp decline in the Turkish lira rate, which in November reached 29 per cent in relation to the dollar.
This has led to economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 ISS entities received a delay in credit payments in 2021
The First Deputy Prime Minister, Alihan Smailov, described the situation of providing benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reports the MIA correspondent Casinform.
“In accordance with the mandate of the Head of State of the Agency of 1 April 2021, the Agency's President of 9 April 2021, No. 127, for the purpose of approving the deferral of payments by small and medium-sized enterprises,” Alihan Smailov wrote in his reply to a request.
He recalled that the arrangement for deferment of loan payments provided for the provision by banks and micro-financial entities of deferment of loans issued before 1 April 2021 to IFRS entities, including IP, between 1 April and 30 June 2021.
The deadline was 30 to 90 days for the selection of the ICB.
The borrower's claim may specify a different period of deferral of payments.
During the period of delay with respect to the borrower, the claim-claiming work was suspended, notification of the need to settle arrears, as well as the borrowing of commissions and other payments by the creditor," the premier noted.
In 2021, second-level banks received late payments from 603 ISS lending entities, of which 553 ISS entities received late payments of 9.7 billion tenge.
The IMF submitted applications for a deferral of 131 IBS entities, of which 95 were granted a deferral amount of 105.8 million tenge," concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Purassev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily carry the strain of "omirone"
The doctor suggested that people with reduced immunity can carry it easier than those with a strong protective reaction
The pulmonist Sergei Purassev explained why the strain of the coronavirus "omirone" could be dangerous.
There's a reason to be looking for a virus.
Scientists believe that omerone is born in a body infected with HIV or with an immune deficiency.
I mean, in a mutation, he didn't face any resistance to immunity.
That makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no response from immunity, he got very fast.
It seems that there's these spinach-whites there, the spikes, there might be more than that, their antibodies didn't cut during mutations, says lungologist Sergei Purassev.
The doctor suggested that people with weak immunity can carry omerone more easily than those with a strong protective response.
It turns out that the body's strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
That's what happens when a 30-year-old dies of pneumococcal infections, and the 60-year-olds carry it.
The immune response of a young man is quite inadequate: where one could only be threatened with a finger, he beats like a rifle by the jaws, and Sergei Purassev concluded.
The doctor also recalled that coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the light is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case only symptoms can be bought - all hope for the body.
The first sign of the developing pneumonia will be the beginning of the body's intoxication -- temperature, weakness, lack of assistance.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, throat first, cough.
Right or left pain, abdominal pain can also be a sign of a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, a growing generation from 12 to 18 years of age may begin to be vaccinated by the end of the year.
The virologist, Head of the IFTI Engineering Laboratory Pavel Volčkov, noted that this category was very active in the kerchief.
For adolescents attending school, the number of contacts is as high as possible.
This is the most socially active site, like child garden educators, "Moscow 24" said, Pavel Volczkov, a virologist, head of the IFTI Genomic Engineering Laboratory.
Most grateful to the author for this article.
I was happy to refresh the memories...
Teath-in.
In those far-reaching 80s, no dancers were treated without the melodies of the group.
And at home, together with friends, danced under their music.
Immunologists have suggested why people with obesity become victims of cholera
The authors studied the fat tissue left from bariatric operations and found that fat cells known as adiposes can be infected with coronary virus.
The immune cells in the fat tissue also infected macrophages, showing a strong inflammatory reaction.
Researchers also studied the fat tissue of patients who died from pelvis and found particles of the coronary virus in the fat that surrounds various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can be hidden in fat tissue using it as a reservoir in an attempt to avoid immune responses.
That's probably what SARS-CoV-2 is capable of.
The biologist explained the causes of dementia
The biological science candidate Semen Golosheikin called the causes of dementia and described how it was prevented in an interview with Radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests a gradual loss of cognitive functions, and in time, a person with difficulty is oriented even in a familiar setting.
Gosheikin noted that the most common causes of dementia include neurodegenerative disorders, headaches, some infections, metabolic disorders and the lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of disease development.
These include hypertension, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the conduct level, the role of social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible," he said.
The development of dementia is also affected by harmful habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorder, and low - moving lifestyles.
Among the first signs, the expert noted the forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and lower the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors of its occurrence," the biologist added.
In order to prevent the occurrence of WHO disease, it is recommended to support the required level of fiscal burden, to train cognitive skills and capabilities that require memory and logic.
Former professor of neurology, neurosurgery and medical genetics FGAOU IN RNIMU.
N.I. Pirogova, head of the department of cognitive violations of the Federal Center of Brain and Neurotechnology, told Anna Bogolepova about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt has returned about 30,000 unlawfully exported from the country of artifacts
In the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has been able to return to its family about 30,000 artifacts that have been illegally smuggled out of the country.
On Saturday, 11 December, Al-Hayat, Chief Inspector of the Department of Returning Ancients of the Ministry of Tourism and Ancients of Egypt, announced this.
Since 2011, the Egyptian State has been able to return 29 300 artifacts.
Only this year in the Bible Museum in Washington, D.C., there were 5,300 memories of ancient Egyptian civilization," he said.
Abdel Howard explained that all smuggled by artifacts were registered in the archives.
The Department's staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts are “following auctions around the world and selling online” through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that cultural values were restored upon return and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts had become an ancient human skeleton in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities requested Interpol to help find Pharaoh Tutanhamen's bush sold for auction in London.
The Christie's auction house held on 4 July, at which the bus age of more than 3,000 years was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art was illegally removed from the Carnak Temple in the 1970s in Luxor.
The head of Tutanhamen, represented by the sun god Amon, was kept in a private collection and has not been on the market since 1985.
How the religion got to Europe, I don't know.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking to repatriate illegally expelled from the country at different times of ancient memory.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of smuggled ancients are the result of archaeological research by black diggers.
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account," and that is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are a single people (near Turks).
If you want to add to it, only 42,000 people live in Crimea.
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people is two words!
Only the Turkish language group unites them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its staff to provide access to their personal mobile devices to the bank, says the Financial Times.
The case is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communications to its staff, instead offering a discount for the acquisition of a mobile phone or smartphone from a telecommunications operator partner.
Under the current rules, the bank may review information on corporate devices issued to its staff as they are used to address business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank has the right to check the mobile devices in extreme cases, for example if it was used by a staff member to meet a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many staff members have moved into a remote working system, the bank wants to extend this rule to all the devices used to address labour issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set a deadline for staff to meet a new rule.
At Credit Suisse, information on the new requirement is not commented.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Essenina, 1925, was fruitful in the plan of creation, but more difficult for the earthly being of the poet and his "hego".
He's already out of any literary associations, he's drifting around with imagination, he's himself, but he's known, he's been excavated, he's sometimes severely offended by criticism, even evil, but the reader's audience is ready to wear it on his hands.
More than 60 poems have been written this year, many of them are now the bosses, complete the "Persid Motives" cycle, written by the poem "Anna Snegina", published by 8 books, the collection "Russian Soviet".
The main success, at the end of June 25, was to conclude with the Essen Treaty for the issuance of its compositions in the 3rd volumes.
None of the modern Sergei Alexandrovich poets have earned such honor, he is the first!
Also, this cost very good money - the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, 300 rubles per month, engineer 200).
The funds were needed that year as never before.
Esenin married Liv Tolste Sofie Tolstan's granddaughter, had to establish a family home, contain Sister Katu and Sasha, as well as mother.
Life would have been something to rejoice in, but for him it was most decorated in dark shades, as if a nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published already after Essenina's death):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
It's the wind blowing.
(They will be) in the open plains, and in the midst of mankind.
It's like a fruit in September.
He's sleeping in the brains of alcohol.
Many well - known scholars have noted that Essenin has given up, looks bad, apparently ill.
There are more and more gangs, nerve collapses.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
In fact, if such a diagnosis is alcoholism, Sergeu Alexandrovich has someone and he has found that there are no reliable documents left.
For example, regarding May 1923, when Essenin urged the fourth woman, the Americans, Eisedora Duncan, restored health in a clinic under Paris to Professor Petr Gannuškin (as Essenin will again fall to him two years later, already in Moscow).
And here's the evidence of the poet's stockpiles, the scandals on this ground, the police's causes are scattered enough by dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20s, the fearsome novel of a poet with a green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Essenin moved for a short time with a friend, Imaginist Ivan Starzov.
Amazingly, though, Essenina had never had her home in Moscow or Peter in his very poor incomes, he met in private homes, in hotels, or in famous ones.
The old man remembers:
"He only came to night, and in most cases he was in a state of unchanging, drunk state.
One day, coming back at four o'clock in the morning, Essenin fell on the stairs...
He fell, scratched his face and shrieked.
With a little in himself, he began to cough constantly, cutting up all the simplicity of blood..."
Yes, even Essenin himself after the war in Europe and in the United States (then there was a dry law, but Duncan accepted a proper supply of alcohol):
"I didn't see anything there except the cabs and the streets...
I've been through and I've stopped remembering...
Well, and the drink, of course...
And I was drinking because the dot got bitten."

Matras Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom 100x195
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom is a modern implementation of the budget model in the premium line.
The base of the matrix is a block of independent duet double spring.
Within a large spring, a softer spring of small size is inserted.
This allows a balanced distribution of the burden on the mattress.
On both sides, the mattress is complemented by an artificial latex.
It's a kind of natural latex, but it's more dense and less expensive.
The flexibility and tension of this material increases the comfort of the matrix.
The artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it doesn't ask for moisture and dust.
Matras will make a great difference in weight (from 20 pounds [30 kg]).
The "stupid" spring doesn't have a wave effect here when the light partner jumps on the side of the heavy.
A pleasant, soft chocolate from the handy jacket Sense asks for a layer of synthetic.
Natural tissue does not absorb static electricity.
It is possible to produce this matrix model in a broken version (vacuum roll-pack).

Mid-Polish believes that Belarus uses migrants as "arms" against the EU
Mid-Polish believes that Belarus uses migrants as “arms”
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, Pavel Yablonski, expressed the view that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, had used refugees as “arms” against the European Union and was about to return to such “operation” next year.
The relevant statement of the closed-up of the IMI was made in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonski, sanctions against Belarus have temporarily “stopped Lukashenko”, but he “is actively seeking new ways”.
The Polish official is also confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
As written by the website kp.ru, the European Union had previously introduced a fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He addressed 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they stated readiness to continue to extend restrictive measures against the Republic, “if the situation in the country is not improved”.
The Ministry responded by introducing a food embargo on a broad list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not by the Shadow Hat": When a bartender's dick makes a man's smile
In the light of the 2021 events, barges were dominated.
Please, the first person to say about his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
In September, he appeared at the premiere of the film "Don't Time to Die" in a bartender's pajamas and a traditional "Bondove" grandmother.
After his example, Prince William, who first awarded The Earthshot Prize for the Royal Dress Code, followed the Royal Variety Prize and then selected a more classic option for the event in support of the Royal Variety charity fund.
A couple of weeks ago, a trend was seen by Lionel Messia.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh Golden Ball in Dolce & Gabbana's bartender.
His sons were dressed in the same way.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for men's pajamas in Russia.
According to the service analysts who went to Gazeta.Ru, they were bought in 1.4 times more.
The most popular hot barber jackets with carpet and silhouette, the main colors are dark-wing, board, dark-haired and, of course, black.
The average price of these models is between 3 and 6 thousand rubbs, and men prefer to buy exclusively pajamas - the set of embroidery suits they choose from.
You can buy them not only from online retellers.
Budget options are in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
The luxury pistachios from the bar in this season are presented in almost every brand - and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
It is considered the most desirable model of Gucci, in which he went to one of the premieres of the "Dom Gucci" Ambassador of the Jared Leto brand.
The choice of precious marmalades gives you the assurance that the barhat is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of switching, weaving is produced by a wet fabric with a wet outer texture and smooth inner side.
More budget options are made of a boy or polyamide, but are therefore smaller.
A fashionable expert, Lamod Ilya Wahoškin, warns that in the case of a barricade, the main thing is not his model or fashion, but the appropriateness.
"Barhat requires evening light, so such a pizza is ideal if you've gathered for a party or a Christmas event," explains Wahoškin. "He'll come in if the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" is included in the invitation."
Another important criterion that allows the choice of a bartender to be made is the status of its buyer.
"The man in the barrage jacket, first of all, should be able to handle the right stuffed tusk with enough, - the authors of Telegram-canal about the male fashion "Krasavčík Brammel." - The owners of the barrage jackets usually belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to adjourned world events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Wahoškin offers to combine a pajamas from the bar with the same things in order: classic screws with arrows, one-to-one sleeves, shelves with hooks, loffers with hooks, stickers.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
Modern experts from Brammel's Crassowchik are convinced that there will be an inappropriate appearance in the barrage of a number of employees at the corporation, and that is, if it's "the leader of those who run this event, "yes", he has such a thing on the subject."
If the employee is below, and his aim is to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to kill the financial bonuses, it is best not to expect a bartender.
The guide accurately evaluates this with the phrase “not on the Blue Hat” - the editors of Telegram-Canal on male fashion.
Very different feelings of vote.
It's an insatiable pit, so tired.

Perhaps if such characters are so sure of their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole wagon, they will not sit there, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beautiful" people, but certainly not because of their appearance.

Immunologist stated that four to five months of revaccination would help to protect against the strain of the coronary virus micron
Revaccination within four to five months can protect from a new strain of coronary infection, micron.
Such a statement was made by the immunologist Nikolai Krüczkov, who called the adjudication six months later, given the emergence of a new strain, “a large period of time”
"In the past, such a period was normal, but now it is best to conduct the procedure five months later, and in the case of people with chronic diseases four," said the expert, calling for revaccination in parallel with the campaign.
Kreuchkov also noted that early revaccination provided a good titre of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a man had two bandages and a booster, or he had a disease and a vaccine, or he had a vaccine and a disease, he had a "hybrid immunity," that is, an antidote that is much and neutralizing enough," said the expert.
"The Great Seven" warned Russia of the "massive consequences" in the event of an invasion into Ukraine
The Great Seven countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) issued a statement on the outcome of the mid-term meeting in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have a huge impact and will have a great impact" in Moscow, but no specific measures are described in the document.
"We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our conviction to increase Russian military power and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine," said the statement.
Ministers further call on Russia to “weaken the escalation, use diplomatic channels and respect its international obligations with regard to the transparency of military activities”, as President Baiden spoke at the time of the video call to President RF Putin on 7 December.
"We reaffirm our support for France and Germany's efforts in the norm form to achieve the full implementation of the Mining Agreements in order to resolve the conflict in the east of Ukraine," said Foreign Ministers of the Great Seven.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have a huge impact and a serious price in response," they warned.
We reaffirm our firm commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine's holding position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our overall and comprehensive response," the statement also states.
Earlier that day, the head of the British diplomat Elizabeth Trass stated that Russia would be "serious" in the event of an invasion into Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed “one voice of the “Large Seven” countries, which accounted for 50 per cent of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have a huge impact on Russia”.
Pfizer vaccine was 32 times less effective than micron-stamp
The effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the micron strain of coronary virus 32 times below the rest of the disease.
This was the conclusion of the University of Hong Kong and the University of Hong Kong, according to South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was less effective on the basis of a study of antiviral activity among citizens receiving two doses of COVID-19.
"We see that most people have had a high level of anti-virus activity against the Sars-CoV-2 baseline, but this capacity has been significantly reduced against micron diversity," said Professor Malik Pearis.
In this context, scientists have stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe coronary infection.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account its impact on the micron-stamp.
The authors concluded that micron-stamp can cause new waves of virus circulation and increased mortality unless further action is taken.
Ukraine's Mine Defense Head accused FRG of blocking NATO arms shipments to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the Government of former FRG Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking the acquisition of the civilian deadly weapon by NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on 12 December, Reznikov recalled that last month, Germany had put a veto on Ukraine ' s anti-sniper systems and incinerators for the loss of unmanned aircraft.
It is noted, however, that Berlin later eased its position on the weapons of war, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons through bilateral agreements with the allies.
In particular, it is the United States, Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the position of the new German Government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Shollz regarding the authorization of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany, Andrej Melnik, expressed the view that Kiev should not wait for Berlin to deliver weapons to Chancellor Sholce.
According to him, the previous FRG leadership explained its refusal to provide arms at the risk of developing the military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite the "occupation by Russia" of the Ukrainian territory.
The same "non-logical" position, a certified diplomat, will be maintained by Germany in the new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelenski said that Kiev was expecting assistance from Berlin in the possession of the marine fleet.
In Ukraine, Germany is expected to "be a technical partner of Ukraine," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of the year, FRG Co-Chairman Robert Habek visited the Republic of China for the sale of defence weapons.

G7 warned Russia of responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine
Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the G7 warned of “serious consequences” for Russia if it continued military aggression against Ukraine, as stated in the parties ' final statement.
The meeting also noted that it condemned the strengthening of the Russian armed forces at the borders of the country.
"Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs," said a statement published on the Government of Great Britain.
Ministers of the G7 and the EU High Representative noted that "they are the only ones in their condemnation of Russian armed reinforcement and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine".
The Head of the IID of the United Kingdom Elizabeth Trass warned of the “great consequences” for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
G7 wants Russia to give up its aggression against Ukraine," she said (TASS quote).
Earlier at the Liverpool Summit, the G7 Foreign Ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis due to the increase in Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties had to return to the negotiating table.
It was about negotiations in Normandy.
The North Atlantic Alliance also spoke for dialogue on Ukraine in Normandy.
The representative of MID Russia, Maria Zaharova, said that, by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, G7 "had been unable to take responsibility for their own mistakes".

Discovered ways to return stolen via the Internet store money
There are several ways to return the money stolen through the Internet store and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were discovered by information security experts in a conversation with the RBC.
Thus, in order to reduce the risk of major losses when data on a bank card fall into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to retain the principal funds on a card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Part of the stock may be deposited in a savings account and withdrawn as necessary.
Experts also recommend setting up a separate map for online purchases.
If the money has been stolen in stores that do not use 3D Secure protection technology, a return procedure can be initiated.
“In the framework of the rules established by payment systems on unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, responsibility lies with the participant in a set of calculations that do not use the service,” explained the representative of Promsvázbanka.
The expert from the international payment provider Ecompay Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer had the right to lodge a complaint with the bank not later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used a card on online resources that did not require two-factor authorization, the transaction could be challenged and returned.
It is noted that in some cases the Internet stores themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been delivered.
On 19 November, a member of the Public Chamber, Director of the League of the Safe Internet, Ekaterina Mizulin, reported that 11 thousand treatments had been received in 2021 on various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for online complaints.
Sholtz arrived in Poland to discuss "North Stream-2" and EU legislation
Germany's newly elected Chancellor Olaf Scholtz has arrived in Warsaw to negotiate a crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the strengthening of Russian troops on the border of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian pipeline "North Stream-2".
Although Shollz has stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for years, the leaders of the two countries have expressed unmistakable expectations of each other.
Prime Minister Mateus Moravetsky of Poland stated that he would call on the Sholtz to speak against the North Stream-2, on which Russian gas is expected to be delivered to Germany in the course of Ukraine.
According to Moravezko, Russia could use gas pipelines against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland ' s efforts to stop the flow of migrants seeking entry from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve the crisis.
Poland ' s judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for differences.
The European Court of Justice has penalized Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right party "Right and Justice" violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its Supreme Court ruled that national legislation had priority over EU rules.
The new Government of Germany, which has been sworn on Wednesday, despite Poland and the United States' demands, has not undertaken public commitments to halt the North Stream-2 operation in the event of an invasion of Russia into Ukraine.
US officials told Congress members that they had reached an understanding with Germany of the gas pipeline stop if Russia entered Ukraine, a high-ranking official of the United States Congress reported on Tuesday.
The German officials did not confirm these messages, but Shollz warned on Wednesday about the consequences if Russia violates the border of Ukraine, and the representatives of the “Large Seven” confirmed that position on Sunday.

The remaining money in the church wall will pay $200,000
The Santechnic who found the money in the church wall in Texas, U.S.A., will pay the prize.
This is reported in the press release of the non-commercial Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in the Great Evangelical Church of Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that devout Christians will have wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, Saint Justin Coley repaired one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of packages with money and waiting.
He handed over the church’s discovery, and he said he did not even get thanks from the truth.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could do," he quoted his KPRC TV.
According to one source, the discovery is related to a theft that occurred seven years ago in the church of Lakewood.
At that time, about $20,000 was lost in cash and $4000,000 in the form of cheques stored in the church safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not lose.
However, information on the offenders was announced a $25,000 reward.
Justin Coley couldn't claim this amount, as the award period has already expired.
Despite this, the non-commercial organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, in its time of awarding five thousand dollars and later receiving another 20,000 dollars in a gift from the Lakewood Church, has decided to reward the integrity of the santechnics.
He'll get 20,000 dollars.
Earlier it was reported that the police had questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the church wall of Lakewood.

In the past, the Brazilian authorities had forced unaccompanied tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
A full protection scheme from COVID-19
A virologist, a doctor of medical science, who deserved the science of Russia, Anatolius Altstein, in a conversation with Ura.ru, revealed a scheme of full protection against coronary infection.
He said that this could be achieved by injecting and using a nascent vaccine.
In the case of international use, a large amount of immunoglobulin A. In the case of an injection vaccine does not occur.
Immunoglobulin A protects the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antithelial).
And if you enter both vaccines, you get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G, but there's still no solution for a double vaccine," the doctor said.
The main prophylaxis of UrFO, doctor of medical science Sergei Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of the use of the nasal vaccination together with the injection was the possibility of stopping being a COVID-19 carrier.
He added that this would help to ensure that in such a case, the protection of the body was supposed to be maximum.
The former Minister of Health of the Netherlands, David Melik-Guseinov, stated that a new blow to the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to the spread of a new coronary infection among children.
He said that this was the picture in other countries where the regular wave of pandemics had arrived earlier.
Other, um...
I talked to the doll (death long ago) like this - if you're ready to change the warm house, the farm, the love, the love and the play on the liquid bitch, then go ahead.
But the horse was trained, and it's not even smart.
He chose my society and walked home.

It's not taken so long, believe me.
I stopped many of the owners from running after the dog, even though they said that the van, 200 thousand running away (pomsky), took the hand and led the other side.
As a result, "200 thousand" was chosen by the host rather than by the dog who ran somewhere.
Mass protests of vaccine opponents are not being stopped in Europe
In Vienna, Austria, more than forty thousand demonstrators went to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination compulsory.

The Spaniards, upset by the health policies of the authorities, took a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some have been holding a poster with the inscription "This is a fake pandemic," "I won't be vaccinated."
A major protest against health passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, copper-certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, sports facilities, old-fashioned homes and night entertainment facilities.
A decision to introduce health passports has been taken by a number of regions to increase the incidence of coronary virus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand manifestors protested against the strengthening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then it got worse in the clashes with the guards.
A group of demonstrators started throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers applied watertights.

WHO has detected micron already in six tens of States
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the new strain of the coronary virus “micron” has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the distribution of the new strain could have disastrous consequences.
The rate of strain distribution was reported in the WHO report.
According to this organization, at 9 December, strains have already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
It has become active only since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of distribution of the new version of the coronavirus.
WHO experts are afraid that the new strain on preliminary data may be passed to the extent of the delta strain, the same Indian version of the coronavirus, which is now leading to absolutely no exception in all countries.
Previously, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhan Gebreyez, said that micron-stamps could have a significant impact on the development of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions also came to Britain.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "micron" will be closing the delta in the coming months.
And the number of patients only in Britain is about 1 million, because officially "micron" is currently suffering from a number of hundreds of people in the Kingdom, and estimated to be up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the micron strain, and more than 2 thousand people will be hospitalized every day.
The British health system will not be able to cope with this.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the micron strain 32 times below the rest of the disease.
How he reacts to the "micron" of the Russian "Sportnik V" is not yet known - it will become understandable within the next few weeks.
The Hamalei Centre has only begun testing the Russian vaccine at the micron strain.

The number of loads increased by 8 per cent to $140 billion.
Such data was published by the Analytical Company App Annie, which submitted a report on the mobile applications market in 2021.
In 2021, the world economy emerged from Lockdown and a post-Pandemic recovery began.
“Will such a “return to physical growth” slow down the application economy? Nothing” is the authors of the report.
India has become the leader of the cutoffs: it has about 20 per cent of all loads.
It is followed by the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of boyfriends on iOS, as before, spent more than Android users on iOS: 65% of all costs were incurred in applications.
Among the annexes, CapCut's video editor took the first spot on the number of jumps for 2021.

Russians warned of a new scheme of fraud
The delinquents began looking for new ways to cheat on video communications.
That's what we're talking about, "Reports" with reference to experts.
According to the director of the product company Ivideo Zaura Abutalimova, the main risk associated with the distribution of video communications is dippheiki.
In this case, fake video is created by fraud on the basis of real records involving the victim.
This neurosect makes it possible to reproduce the characteristics of a person ' s behavior.
Abutalim has added that using dippheek, criminals can call a known video victim or create a role with a human copy to be sent to blackmail.
"These subversives can simply cause bulling, because a subversive criminal can put people in unscrupulous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scene scenarios," said the expert.
The leading system engineer, Varonis Aleksandr Vetkel, in turn, noted that psychological people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could pose specific risks in the case of video technology.

Dr. Paulva told me about the migraine of the day off in labor camps
Several factors can lead to loss of self-esteem in the outputs
The reason for the loss of self-esteem after the workplace is often the “migraine of the endocrinologist, a well-known doctor, a medical science candidate, a senior professor at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of ICU, a scientist at the Zuhra Paulov System Medical Clinic in his telegram channel.
According to her, it is especially common for laborers who experience major pain, breakdown, and weakness in the outputs.
Dr. Paulva noted that, in addition to the week of fatigue, there are enough objective causes of the body's negative reaction to change conditions.
Our lives are changing in a radical way.
"We sleep long, we sleep all day, we'll probably eat more, and we'll eat less," the doctor argued. "Because of the lack of coffee, a small fraction begins.
Because of their overeating and lack of water, they are heavy and broken.
The additional role is to be played at a late stage.

Researchers in the UAR reported low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against “micron”
In the UAR, Pfizer vaccine has been reported to be low against “micron”
Researchers in the South African Republic conducted a study and reported low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against the micron strain of coronary infection.
It is estimated that it (the level of neutralization of the “micron”) corresponds to the (level) effectiveness of the vaccine in 22.5% against symptom infection, and therefore... doubts the vaccine's ability to protect against infection are expressed in the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
In this regard, experts have explained that the medicine can save from the serious flow of the disease.
Previously, in the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the micron-stamp coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemics in Britain with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much secret sugar in ordinary products?
Sugar is not the best source of useful nutrients.
Its surplus can lead to second-type diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Users should take into account that under the unknown word the product may contain a hidden sugar ingredient, similar sugar by calorie, composition and glycaemic index.
A number of dozens of names can be presented on the label, in fact, indicating sugar.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fructose.
There may also be other sugars, such as dextrose (saccharine derived from maize), leucose (fruit sugar), melase (black potatoes), syrup agava, etc.
These are all simple hydrocarbons that belong to mono- and disacharides, and they may not only be in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in the doctoral flask, bread, etc.
According to the Russian Federation, the most effective way to reduce the consumption of sugar is to use whole and unprocessed products, as well as to focus on the label and many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugars differ in taste, but as much as the ingredient in the product is called syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white, it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact quantity of sugar, as not only the quantity of sugar indicated by the manufacturer in the package should be taken into account, but also that the fruit, fruit, etc. originally contains a certain quantity of sugar.
Thus, the total number of sugars may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
Chancellor of Germany Scholtz: Gas loses importance for FRG after 25 years
The new FRG Chancellor Olaf Scholtz said that gas imports were losing importance for Germany, as the country continued to move towards decarbonization.
According to him, by 2045 Germany had planned to completely renounce gas, oil and coal, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is 25 years from now, the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to FRG and Europe will play a different role," the Chancellor said.
Scholtz noted that Germany continued to be committed to transporting Russian natural gas and in the future, as this resource was now important for energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement that included support from Berlin for Ukraine ' s energy transformation.
A former head of IDI Germany, Annala Berbok, stated that the process of gas pipeline certification "North Stream - 2 " was continuing.
According to the Minister, in the framework of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition treaty, it was stated that energy projects should apply European energy law.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline is "not in conformity with the requirements" of the European Union.

The hackers broke Twitter Prime Minister of India
The hackers broke the Twitter account of Prime Minister of India Narendry Modi.
Criminals have been able to publish a fictitious message.
It was reported that India had allegedly recognized the Bitcoin as a legitimate means of payment, and that the country had already purchased a cryptodescription.
At Modi's office, they asked for new messages to be ignored.
The prime minister said that Twitter had responded quickly - they had restored access to the account.
The Indian Prime Minister's site had already broken up in 2020 and called for contributions to the fund through encryption.
At the New Caledonia referendum, most voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same outcome as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, the majority of New Caledonia ' s inhabitants voted during the referendum against their territory ' s independence.
The level of participation in this third vote was much lower than in the previous two votes.
According to preliminary results published by the local authorities, New Caledonia ' s independence from France was 3.51% (2755) of those who voted, while 96.49% (75 762) voted against.
Japan was 43.90 per cent, with more than 80,000 New Caledonian people taking part in the elections.
According to France-Presse, “the outcome of these elections did not leave room for doubt,” as independence advocates urged voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they objected to it on 12 December, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevented a full and “honor” pre-election campaign.
Thus, this lack of participation opened the way for the third victory of French New Caledonia's supporters, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, against independence, 56.7 per cent of the population voted, in 2020, 53.3 per cent.
As separatists have said, they do not recognize the outcome of the last vote and challenge them in the UN.
As told on Sunday, 12 December, in the Ellisian Court, the President of France Emmanuel Macron should follow the referendum.
The topic of independence of New Caledonia has greatly revived the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several candidates to the presidents expressed the benefit of keeping the territory in France, since it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific".
“New Caledonia must remain French,” said Eric Zemmur repeatedly.
The same statement was made by a candidate from the Republic of Valerie Pekras, who, at the end of October, published a column in Le Figaro, urging the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take the position “because it is not his responsibility”.
However, the President added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia".
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire for the election of the Caledonians to be the choice of France".

WSJ readers criticised the article on Russian and US relations
Readers The Wall Street Journal criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell's article, in which he described his vision of Russian and U.S. relations.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West was allegedly bringing Ukraine to the Russian victim.
In his article, he convinced readers of the danger that comes from Moscow and allowed a number of offensive statements to be made to the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of Hartwell called for Western countries to “stand up against Russia in a single front”.
The WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of American professor.
"In this article, there is a lot of false information," says RIA News a commentary from one of the readers.
"Europe is not ours to "lost" it, and Ukraine is not our land.
The US and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine," another noted.

Magnitude earthquake 5.2 occurred in the Curyl Islands area
An earthquake of 5.2 occurred near the island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the earthquake epicenter was 231.8 km north-east of the city of North Kurilsk.
Ochag lay at a depth of 92.5 km.
Previously, seismologists recorded an earthquake of 7.5 magnets in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing reactive pilots of a new generation
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant, an ANKA type of reactive non-pilot aircraft (BPLA) will begin to be created.
On 11 December, the superintendent of the head of the Office of the Ukrainian President, Alexei Arestovic, reported.
That is, they are capable of acting against air objects, against other unmanned aircraft.
Even against a pilot's flight.
They will have Ukrainian engines and other Turkish aircraft: a corpus and so on," he quoted Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA devices, Arestovic explained that these are reactive and not disruptive BPLAs.
He said it was a new generation of unmanned pilots after Bayraktar who exceeded it “in all characteristics”.
The first BPLA party should be produced by a factory at the end of next year, Arestovic concluded.
ANKA aircraft was established by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of a non-pilot was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
Recently, the Ukrainian General Staff has classified data on the use of the Bayraktar non-pilots and the Javelin missile facilities during military operations of the United Forces in Donbass.
On 6 December, the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, announced that the country had begun the construction of a factory for the construction of modern military unmanned aircraft.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use the drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Mining Defences concluded an agreement on the construction of the Kiev Centre, which will provide training for staff, as well as testing and servicing of Turkish BPLA Bayraktar.
The Office of the Ukrainian Leader's Press Service called this memorandum "a great real step forward".
Two lions escaped at the airport from the container
The lions fled to Singapore airport.
That's what The Straits Times reports.
Two predators were able to get out of a container with a family of lions coming on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were sent.
One of the running lions went to the roof of the container.
The animals could not escape from it because of a number of protective nets.
The opposition ended after the arrival at the airport of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which is the leader of all Singapore Zoos.
They disengaged the lions with the help of the trinkilizers and planned to deliver them to the quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Pnompene, the capital of Cambodia, the lion fled from the owner and wandered on the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, not being harmed.
Specialists warned about the threat of vitamin B9
Studies show that the excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express was warned about this.
Experts believe that there is strong evidence that people who do not experience a lack of folic acid are less likely to suffer from some types of cancer, in particular colorectal.
However, the increase in the required dose, in contrast, contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of Alabama University in Birmingham, Dietologist Bet Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer is increased only if it is substantially derogated from that figure to a larger or smaller extent.
Kitchin recommends that vitamin B9 be not taken in tablets without a recommendation by the physician, should be followed by dosing and should be avoided with milk and other foodstuffs containing folic acid.
Earlier, a nutrition consultant named Rachel Finn as a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is, among other things, in avocado, Fain recommended that men have this fruit after 50 years.
In the United Kingdom, about 75,000 people can die by April because of micron-stamp.
British scientists predict that because of the spread of the micron-stamp coronavirus within the next five months, up to 75,000 people could die in England, unless there were more restrictive winter measures.
The Guardian reported this with reference to the study of experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports the TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists, who are part of the Scientific and Advisory Panel on Emergency Situations at the British Cabinet of Ministers, at least 25 thousand summer out of the micron strain will be recorded in the country by April 2022, while about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
As a result, more than 2,000 patients will be hospitalized every day.
"Serious measures to combat coronary virus may be required to avoid overloading the National Health Service if the micron strain is more contagious than the delta option, and the existing vaccines will not be able to eliminate infections," said mathematician Rosenna Bernard of LSHTM.
The British Health Safety Agency had previously informed that if the rate of micron-stamp distribution remained at the current level, about 1 million cases of infection would be detected by the end of the year.
By mid-December, micron strains could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, 1898 cases of coronary micron-stamp infection have been detected in Britain, of which 633 were detected in the last few days.
On 9 December, the head of the British Minhrav Sajid Javid pointed out that in reality this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.
She wanted to write some smart commentary, but she read it to this place:
"The noise resulting from the incredible suffering of an unlucky animal and its employment for the second job."
And it fell under the table!
It turns out, "unlucky animal" is a man, and I thought he was a genius!

The demand for superheroes grew worldwide by four
This year's construction is over, and next year's orders are all recorded in the world, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the world fleet register, the number of yachts ordered was 1200 units, 4 more than last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change on greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that there will be no reduction in the number of people who have the desire and the money for the 50 million dollars per pound and above, says Guardian.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year 25 per cent of the courts were ordered more than in the past.
Brokers say there was no 20-year-old travel on the market.
The first reason is that many people who can afford a boat are afraid of soil infections and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronary virus.
If all these people had previously gone to the office and had met with business partners in person, the absolute majority of them now work away and the negotiations were held on the road.
Broker Will Christy told the newspaper that the surfers are taking orders for new boats for 2025 and later.
This means that the customers are ready to pay more, only if their yacht was ready for at least a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize such conduct of the rich and call it a decadent.
The wealthy, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in the time of the deprivation of travel to space, the life on the yachts or on their own airplanes is causing disunity in society, as the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with all the rest of mankind.
Economists call on Governments to act and propose that new taxes and rules be introduced for the super-rich, although they understand that this will be extremely difficult to implement.
By the way, it only impresses the number of super yachts, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1200 vessels 27 are over 100 metres in length.
The Norwegian billionaire Rekke builds the REV Ocean yacht 183 metres long.
After landing on the water, it'll be the biggest yacht in the world.
The yacht includes a "moon pool", as well as a underwater boat designed to explore sea depths.
On existing super-planes, helicopters, open-air cinemas, and some of them, for example, on McGregor's yacht, have become a platform for singles.A professor of economic anthropology at the American University of Indiana Richard Wilk says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gases, carbon footprints produced by super-richs are insignificant.
But it's symbolic if you realize that the multibillionaires in the world hear more than 2,000 people.
This is just another example of overusing a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission after billionaires is a thousand times more of the world ' s average statistician.
If one man produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the world's largest pollutant is Roman Abramovic, responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases falling into the atmosphere in 2018.
The two thirds of the emission trail were caught on its Eclipse yacht, 162.5 metres long.
Even if the owner is not on board, the team continues to poison the planet.
The master may call the captain and allow the command to push the boat, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea in the Caribbean.
The masters of the superheroes do not express the compassion of others when they, like the most wealthy woman in Australia, Jean Rainhard, who owns the continent's mines, complains through YouTube that there is no room for their giant courts.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build a vessel of less than 20 feet [50 m].
Hazardous weekly dose of alcohol leading to the development of herb cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol per week increases the risk of cancer development.
That's what Daily Express says.
Experts have concluded that the use of four and more portions of alcohol per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
This increases the likelihood of disease development by increasing the amount of alcohol used.
Moreover, moderately drinking men are at risk of cancer of the bladder higher than women.
The precise reason for the development of such a type of oncology cannot be determined by scientists, noting only that certain factors cause harm to the body of the process.

Dogs can understand the words and phrases of a two-year-old child
Many, and more precisely, lovers of dogs are convinced that these creations are very intelligent.
But they don't even remember how many fourths of the pies actually developed.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out how animal intelligence develops.
Although the oral stockpiles of the dog are not as extensive as human, the new study proves that the dog can react consistently to 89 words or phrases.
Scientists' efforts were published in Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or make texts, they don't mean anything in politics, economics and art, but they often manage to get their bosses up.
Some people believe that experts show the best results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are not yet sufficient.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses, for example, labadores.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and that they do not give birth to a two-year-old.

Preparations for United States and Russia in Ukraine
The United States and Russia will be "trafficking" about Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kotzkov said in his article "Glavov".
In his view, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations on the United States guarantees that Ukraine will not enter the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Baiden on the right to “enter” countries.
If you are offered something that you are not aware of, for example, selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not become a merchant, but simply send the bidder.
And for Ukraine, there is a trade," wrote an analyst.
Kotekov added that Russia is not planning to attack Ukraine, but is seeking dialogue with Kiev.
“Preparation is conducted in secret, quickly and immediately, in an offensive manner, rather than waiting for the group to find and deploy resistance forces,” he noted.
China encourages the development of the rail transport sector
China ' s forward technologies drew the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries to the 2021 China International Exhibition of Traffic Transport and Production of Equipment, held in the city of Žuzhou Province of Hunan /Central China.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical failures, the representative of Hou Zhaovenh noted.
High-speed trains on the China-Laos rail line, which had been put into service at the beginning of this month, have already been equipped with these technologies to ensure greater reliability and flexibility of the rolling stock.
In the last six months China has significantly increased the export of rail vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe have become witnesses of China's speed.
In May this year, with the production line of the company CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd, the first two-storey high-speed electric vehicles designed for export to Europe were combined in China.
At a maximum working speed of 200 kilometres, these trains will travel on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the pilot operation of the metro train developed by the above-named company for Turkey began.
The train will be driven by a metropolis, connecting the Stambul centre to the city airport.
The metro movement will be open next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey at 120 kilometres per hour.
"The Chinese railway equipment industry is one of the highest-level industries in innovation and the most powerful international innovation competitiveness," said Fen Yaosen, Head of the Chinese Trade and Investment Department of the Committee for the Promotion of International Trade /CSRMT/.
“This industry is the main competitive advantage of China’s production of high-class equipment on the world market,” said Fen Yaosen.
After more than 60 years of hard work, through a number of independent research and development, China has established a better rail equipment production system, with a complete support set and large-scale production activities.
According to Fen Yaosen, the country takes the first place on the electricity level of the railways and on the operation of high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed early signs of dementia
The candidate for biological sciences Semen Golosheikin, in a conversation with Radio Sputnik, listed the early signs of dementia.
He said that the signs of future dementia could be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive violations, such as inability to concentrate, planning, and lower abstract thinking.
A discussion is being held that hearing loss may be both the early onset of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors of its occurrence, said the expert.
Gosheikin stressed that the causes of dementia could be neurodegenerative disorders, headaches, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the brain vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today doctors do not know how to treat dementia.
It is therefore necessary to initiate its prevention in a timely manner.
He said that lowering the risk of dementia would help to study foreign languages and active communication.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical stress, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive memory and thinking logic
“There are recommendations for the application of various BADs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still being discussed in the scientific community,” Golosheikin said.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical stress, regular training of cognitive skills and skills through games and hobbies requiring intense memory and thinking logic,” Golosheikin said.
The British Dementary Study Organization stated earlier that the disease is increasingly affecting people over the age of 40.
The doctors called early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first alarming sign can be seen as a problem with vision, which causes the patient to gain difficulty in identifying objects.
Another sign of developing weakness has been called an aphasia -- a condition where people can't find the right words to convey what they want to say.
Neurologist needed to send Saakashvili to treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili needed psychological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, said neurologist Otar Toidé, who is in the council of doctors established by the Georgian ombudsman.
His [Saakasvili] neurological status is the leading cause of his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, change in character," said the expert, noting that this is not a normative framework and now the ex-president needs to be rehabilitated.
"This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psychological rehabilitation, which we did not find in Georgia," said Toid, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special facility that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began to sabotaging medical care after the prison officials had punished him.
Georgian politics has quickly succeeded in abolishing the punishment and restoring itself to the former rights.

Protests against COVID passports have been made in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests against the mandatory certificate of vaccination from COVID-19 have been carried out by Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, the COVID-passports became mandatory for walking in bars, restaurants, sports halls, old-fashioned homes and night entertainment facilities.
Many manifestives have come to action without masks.
By lies on their posters, they accused the State of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, the vaccination passport will also be required to enter entertainment facilities and will be restored to more than 50 people.
The protesters in the city declared the medical dictatorship and called the vaccination an experiment.
More than 5.2 million cases of coronary virus infection have been reported in Spain since the beginning of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia is also planning to impose restrictions on non-vaccinated persons.
The QR Code Single System Bills have been introduced by the Government to the Parliament on 12 November.
Russians are expected to be able to visit places of mass activities, cultural institutions, public food facilities and retail trade with either a certificate of vaccination or a transfer of disease or a medad of vaccination.
The same rules will be laid down for travel on trains and aircraft.

Red rise: how the Chinese become horny
The Olympics should attract millions of people and help create international court in the country
China hopes that not only will Olympiada attract 300 million people to winter sports activities, which will enable President Si Xinpin to collect 1 trillion yuan, but also enables the economic development of remote provinces.
The mountain resort of Taiwan in Zjanzjakou, located not far from the winter Olympics, is becoming more popular with Chinese.
In addition to infrastructure construction in the region, greening work is also being carried out: workers are cutting trees.
There are over 700 mountain resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to accept international competitions.
In many regions of China, where there are resorts, including Zhanzjakou, there are snow problems.
The main challenge for the long-term is to provide comfortable and interesting rest in Chinese resorts so that all new arrivals can become permanent.
However, it was still far away.
The adviser to Igor Justin Downs said that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese lying industry has changed to ignorance.
Every winter, there are more and more Chinese.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite serious changes, it will take many more years to create a mountain culture here, says Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to develop and create the infrastructure needed for rest.
The 70-year-old Gao Macong lives in Choulli, not far from the winter Olympics.
He noted that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a speedy railway from Beijing in Chohli, now none of the locals suffer from unemployment.
In the country, more and more shops are being opened with clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the thresholds, there is a contact point with the candles of the national kitchen.
There's even a COVID-19 test station in Taiwan.
China is seeking to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must be leaders of major international competitions, and resorts and equipment must reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world can face extreme poverty because of the pandemic, said WHO
More than 500 million people in the world can be driven into extreme poverty due to the pandemic of coronary virus, which has slowed mankind’s progress in universal access to health services, reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
Two complementary reports were published on the International Day of Universal Health Services of WHO and WB on 12 December.
They noted that the pandemic had led to problems in the provision of medics, caused excessive stress in health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the immunization coverage was reduced, and the mortality rate of tuberculosis and malaria increased.
In WHO and the UK, the pandemic has caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it has become more difficult for people to pay for treatment”.
This situation affects more than 500 million people “in extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services from their karma.”
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterrish stated that the coronavirus pandemic had put more than 100 million people in poverty, and more than four billion people had virtually no social support.

Reuters: The Taiwanese Minister turned off the transmission to the "Sammite for Democracy" on request of the White House
The speech of Taiwan's Digital Technology Minister, Audrey Tan, on the panel discussion during the United States-organized “Samith for Democracy” was translated into video-free mode, as shown by the recording of the summit on YouTube.
The Agency of Reuters, referring to sources, claims that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to them, it was the reason why Taiwan had been granted a separate colour from the PRC, which considered the island its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world to the extent of civil rights.
Taiwan was awarded green as "free", and the PRC, the PRC, Laos and Viet Nam are red as "closed".
After the Minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced on the screen, noting that the views of the participants in the discussion “did not necessarily express the position of the United States Government”.
The CD has not been invited to the Sammit for Democracy.
Sources of Reuters note that the map demonstrated by the Taiwanese Minister could go contrary to the one China policy held by Washington.
One of the Agency's sources stated that, following the demonstration of the map, the US National Security Council was angry with the Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan by a separate country.
The “Samith for Democracy” organized by Washington, D.C., took place from 9 to 10 December, with representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
The Russians have not been invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” of the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, the editor-in-chief of the “New Newspaper” called for the establishment of an international fund through which the money gained through corruption was given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary Sovbeza RF Yuri Averyanov stated that the summit was “an anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge”.

And when it's off, what right do you have to condemn them?
I guess it's just education so...
The parents chosen (self) dictate their rules by making an honest contribution to the already existing ones.
What if this is the case with other areas of life, court proceedings, etc.?

In the Middle Ages, there was a "serious conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States.
In an interview with the Investigatives, the headlines of the Russian media, Sergei Riabkov, assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long way of interaction had led to disastrous conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not begun yesterday.
One side is negative predictability, and this is in some way the prospect of improving relations is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion as a result of the long journey we have both with the current administration and with Trump and with Obama.
The problems started not yesterday," said the diplomat.
According to Rybkov, the problem is that the United States is seeking to impose a number of approaches on Russia.
The media headlines added that it would not be risky to provide optimistic forecasts of the prospects for better relations and would not expect to change Washington's position.
He explained that there was no progress except in terms of strategic stability and cybersecurity.
Russia therefore calls upon the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hopes that signals will be heard and that Americans will listen to sound arguments.
Former Head of the Media of Russia Sergei Lavrov, at a meeting with US Secretary-General Anthony Blinken, said that Moscow was ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
The virologist warned about the risk of vaccination with a coovid-naïve agent outside the hospital
Allergy may occur and need medical attention, so the first points for the administration of this medicinal product are not to be organized at airports and shopping centres.
Tacus virologist, member of the RAN, spokesperson for bioananotechnology, microbiology and virology of the University of Novosibir State, Sergei Netesov, reported.
It would be easy to organize vaccinations at airports and shopping centres, but I would do so only at the first time in medical institutions.
The case is that there is a likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small but desirable for a person to sit next to the doctor's office.
The doctor has a special set of antiallergic drugs that operate literally within a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," Netesov said.
In the view of the virologist, it is possible to think of vaccination in shopping malls when experience is gained in the use of the product.
He also stressed that when using a nascent vaccine, it was important for her to fall into a mucous membrane.
However, there is a likelihood that the vaccine will not reach its destination if it is swallowed after pressing.

In the United Kingdom, 1239 cases of micron-stamp coronavirus were reported in Russian
In the days of Britain, 1239 cases of infection were detected by a new micron strain of coronary virus.
That's what Sky News reports on.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the micron strain were reported in England, 38 were diagnosed with new infections in Scotland and five were reported in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 patients from the new strain in the United Kingdom reached 3137.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in Pessimistic Prediction estimated that 75 thousand people could die by April as a result of the outbreak of the coronary virus caused by the micron strain.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that imposed anthrosian sanctions
The Press Secretary, President Dmitri Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-racial sanctions in the event of continued “aggressive actions” against Ukraine, including due to the alleged “incursion” on the territory of the country.
"Some restrictions on the introduction of Russians and the absence of suffering on their own are impossible," said the official representative of the Kremlin in the air of the Russian telecanal.
The sand says it's "understands everything in the world."
It was previously reported that the United States considered the possibility of introducing anthrosian sanctions in the field of energy as a final measure.
In addition, Washington and the Euro Union are planning to impose restrictions that will make it difficult to convert rubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank's German Graff is certain that it's impossible.

New Caledonians rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of the participants refused to leave France.
On 12 December, the French television station BFM.TV reported this.
Against independence, 96.5% of the voters voted.
The independence of France was maintained by 3.51% of the inhabitants of the Archipelago in the south of the Pacific.
The results have been cancelled by 2.99 per cent of the bulletins.
The voting level on that day was very low: about 55 per cent of the population of the archipelago came to the sites.
Experts believe that the low incidence is due to separatists ' calls to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronary virus.
Paris refused to transfer the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the New Caledonian people voted against France's independence in the referendum.
A referendum on independence has already been held in the region in 2018.
The majority of the population supported the finding of an archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is nearly 20,000 kilometres from the mainland of France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
There are approximately 270 thousand people living in the archipelago, and the territory is given a special administrative and territorial status.
Between Paris and the New Caledonian Administration, the 1998 agreement provides that the region can vote on its independence twice in two years.

WHO deems micron to be more dangerous than delta
The World Health Organization (WHO) is of the view that micron is less dangerous than coronavirus strain delta.
However, there is evidence of a reduction in the effectiveness of vaccines in the disease with a new version of COVID-19.
According to information on 9 December, “micron” is registered in 63 countries.
“Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigen profile of the strain “micron” strain allow the vaccine to be reduced against infection and transfer.
According to preliminary findings from the UAR, it is expected that it (the "weight of the disease" - order) may be less difficult than the "delte" - says the WHO Technical Communication.
The organization notes that as long as all recorded cases of micronomial infection in the EU are easily or inescapably occurring.
However, the new strain, according to the preliminary data, is spread more rapidly.
Two cases of micron-stamp infection have been reported in Russia.
They “were previously immunized,” the Gamalai Centre reported.
Anna Popova, Head of Plant Protection, stated that there is no reliable data yet that the new version of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios were cited for Green
The High Council Ex-Deputy Vadim Denisenko listed four developments for Ukraine's President Vladimir Zelenski in 2022.
In his view, the Head of State could remain without Western support, as well as possibly at the Donbass compromises.
On Sunday, 12 December, Denisenko told us in publications on the Glavoj portal.
The first option, Denisenko called the “ideal storm”, implies that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries by reaching agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such developments will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
" There is a parallax reduction in the prices of key goods that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and the opposition of the authorities to key GEFs (financial and industrial groups). - Order " , added the ex-Parliamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of the development of the situation - “war against all”.
This forecast will arise in the event of high turbulence in world politics, where the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of challenges.
Because of such a situation, the leadership of Ukraine may go to Donbass compromises, which may result in domestic resistance.
At the end of the summer, the position of the Greens will be weakened, and the probability of such a situation, according to the former backdrop, is up to 50-55 per cent.
The third option of developing the situation in Ukrainian politics is the opposition to the Green Group and the President, which is likely to lead to the control of the force and the implementation of “populist initiatives”.
During such a crisis, the Greens will begin to "reform the government", Denisenko added.
Another scenario is turning Green into a "father of the nation."
This could lead to a dramatic event that would be a great shock to society.
"The compound must be large enough to respond to external partners and increase Ukraine's support," said Denisenko.
This version of the situation is possible as a result of natural disasters, technological disasters or aggressive actions by Russia, the former deputy considers it possible.
However, the Russian side has not again rejected any "attacks" in Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States were increasing military activity within Russian borders.
Earlier, on 11 November, data from the social group "Rating " survey showed that the ratings of the Ukrainian President fell to record low values, accounting for 19.3 per cent.
This is the lowest indicator since the election of his head of State.
Analysts predicted the situation in which, in the case of the next elections of the President of Ukraine, a total of 21.8 per cent would vote for the Greens, while the former President of the country, Petr Poroshenko, 14.5 per cent, would vote.
However, only 19.3 per cent of all respondents expressed their support to the President.

Arrested for action in the Red Square poet: "To quote Eutushenko give 10 days, here's the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Wolchenkov was arrested.
The student of the VSE was detained in the Red Square with a poster on which was written the hashtage of #students and many of them.
This quote belongs to the writer Eugenia Eutushenko.
A protocol on the administrative article on the recurrence of public action had been prepared in Alexandria.
For the first time, he was arrested on 23 January at the Pushkin Square, at a meeting in support of Alexe Navalio.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now to its interest, unfortunately lost, to the legacy of a common culture in Russia, and to inspire as little unknown poets to write their texts online under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted a young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to more detail the text of his message.
How did the police contact you in custody this time and before?
What was asked in the department, how did they comment on your action?
This time, staff were more correct, detention was as important as it was not funny in some context of the word.
On Puškin, the OMONovs took and took hard.
They asked standard, about the motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked at it as if it were not for approval, and they understood it.
With the exception of all four sides of the ambiance, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what it was.
And if after the action under this hash, I start to write my verses, at least a few people, I'm not cutting off these 10 days.
Maximum, according to the protocol, speak at once in the Tumba-Umba tribe.
Public and official activities speak the surrounding language so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on 25 September 2001 or in the native language through the translator.
This is the protocol, and nothing more, namely, Angela Merkel speaks Russianly, but still resorts to the help of the translator.
There is also a verbatim on the old man's handbook and a verbatim is not required to know a few languages.

Researchers have described how potatoes help to combat age violations
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root fruit contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folate and pantotenic acids.
All of these elements help to operate the system of the body.
Moreover, potatoes help to combat age violations.
Thanks to the large content of the cell, it is useful for the stomach tract and can also help with the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis when used regularly.
However, for the most part, the root fruit is better to dry or boil rather than to burn on the oil.
The previous publication The Daily Express warned that potatoes may be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other products with a high glycaemic rate.
These are products containing carbohydrates that are rapidly spread to sugar, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the Kommersantt warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting the reduction of its production in personal sub-sectors and the increase in processing capacity.
In the view of market participants, the product deficit at this point can only be replaced by imports.
Lostfilm, Lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the "Andes" edition.
Candidates for departure
In 2015, the rights holders of the RAEC/Media cluster made up a list of 100 major pirate sites and most of them ceased to exist, said the director of the Internet Research Institute Karen Kazaryan.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to the regular change of domain name, he adds.
For example, at Lostfilm, which is available in the search edition of both "Andesa" and Google, you can see pirate copies of the Netflix series "Play in Calmara" and "Frequentness" by the director Anna Melikan, the original major series of video services in Russia.
At Kinogo, which is also available in search, you can see the animation newspaper Encanto, but according to video quality, it is a so-called screen (recorded in a movie theater, a pirate copy of the movie).
On Filmix, which can also be found through searches, the "Universal." 10 years later, TNT (enters the "Gasprom media").

Orthopedic Spring Mother, Micro Ulmite.
The model is comfortable with having two different soft surfaces – high fat and hearing more average.
Only quality and premium supplements are included in the product, which have been recommended exclusively for the best.
In the centre of the model, a block of independent "micropacket" feathers is established.
This means that there are 2,000 spirals in the bedroom that work fully autonomously.

The Micropacket is the highest in all the variety of the winter blocks of Dimax, therefore it has a marked orthopaedic effect and is considered to be premium.
Fillers: upper and lower of the spring have a combination of curve layers and natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the spot.
If one surface has a latex, the other has a cocoon.
Such a tandem of fillers has long been classic since it transmits not only orthopedic but also anatomical properties to the mattress.
If the cobra provides proper back support, the latex will adapt the surface to the human body.
The model is placed in the simple triangular Aloe Vera.
If the client wishes to, he can be both self-contained and stable.
The total height of the product is 27 cm and the recommended load is 170 kg.

Estonian scientists will look for life in Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, prepares three space missions to Venus to find the signs of life in the atmosphere, reported the “Current Camera” on Sunday.
The goal of the five-year mission is to assess the propensity for the life of the Venus clouds and then to find life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists have proposed tools to measure acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
So far, it has been assumed that the Venus Cloud, the nearest planet to Earth, is too acidic to be able to exist there, but probably Venus was originally an Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a sample must come from Venus.
Let us assume that if we find life there, it will be a fundamental question whether it is earthly or not.
If so, it would be obvious that life on earth did not begin.
However, if it is different, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth," said the Estonian leader of the Venus Life Finder project Michael Pausalu.

Meteorological Change in Russian Business
The theme of the meta age has become a popular autumn of this year, when Mark Tuckerberg announced the conversion of Facebook to Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the biggest player confirmed the development of a new form of digital interaction between people.
This means that businesses in Russia, as well as around the world, will invest in the creation of their own meta- ages and their subsequent monetaryization.
The target population should be seen as a continuation of objective trends.
On the one hand, the tendency to create remote interactions in the pandemic is that people have become disillusioned and restricted.
On the other hand, this is the result of the business's desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models under them.
Third, they are a logical continuation of the asset digitization trend, when any rights, valuable papers, works of art and even money are converted into a digital format.

British economist couldn't predict 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to predict 2022, since he felt that such attempts would be unsuccessful.
He wrote this in an article for the Project Syndicate.
The expert is of the view that the next year will be an unpredictability factor and any trend may change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the pandemic of coronary virus, and secondly, inflation, it relies on it.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether to increase the price of goods was temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of the infinite generosity of central banks had already survived” and that the time had come to return to relations where inflation rates would correspond to the expected growth rate of GDP.
O'Neill noted that, in the face of the pandemic, the continuation of super-soft economic policies could, in the opinion of some experts, lead to a new rise in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to productivity growth, as well as poverty and climate change, O'Neill summarized.
Michael Schulgin, a former head of the Global Investment Research Division, reported that positive expectations for the 2022 dollar course remained, while growth potential would be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar, Sulgin called the monetary policy of FRS, the dynamics of oil prices and the fear of the crown virus pandemic.
I have to agree.

Russians gave around 4.5 per cent of their GDP to car dealers
As a result of 10 months of 2021, the Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, 28 per cent more than in the same period last year, according to the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI) statistics.
To understand the scale, about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the State in support of citizens and the economy during the coronary virus pandemic.
Last September, President Vladimir Putin of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization said that this amount was more than 4.5 per cent of the country ' s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Korean brand Kia is led by Russian market revenues.
Within 10 months of this year, he managed to make a total of 325.7 billion rubles, almost 24 per cent more than a year earlier.
The Hyundai family's Kia brand is still more than 35 per cent, and the sales profit is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In leading positions, this brand, and the increase in the average price of the car - in Hyundai's year it has grown by almost 21 per cent, up to 1.94 million rubles - was the strongest travel dynamic only in Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
However, the volume of sales to Korean brands has not increased significantly: according to the statistics of the Autoproducer Committee of the European Business Association in Russia, Kia has achieved 9.4% more than a year earlier in the same period.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
It shuts down a three-year-old Toyota, who spent 275.5 billion rubles on this Russian car in 10 months, 14 per cent more than a year ago.
The Japanese reported that Mercedes-Benz had 266.1 billion rubles (+75 per cent) - the German brand premium had grown and sold (37 per cent) and the average car price ( almost 28 per cent, up to 8.2 million rubles).
"Meredes-Benz also has a good sales growth and a medium-sized price -- more, for example, than BMW -- from here and greater financial capacity -- explained the NAPI director Tatian Arabaji.
At the rate of growth in sales, the fantastic indicators show Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased the financial gap this year."
The Russian Lada on income growth shows medium-term rates (plus 28 per cent), which cost 229,4 billion rubles in 10 months.
Last year there were companies whose machinery sales fell in 2021: in particular Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
In less than 10 months, the Russians spent 12 billion rubles on the off-roads and pickups of this brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year ago.
In the face of the problems with the supply of auto components and the distortions in the production of the entire world highway, the auto companies continue to adjust prices continuously - the same AutoWAZ has increased the value of the Lada seven times a year, the last trip (on 8-10 thousand rubles) took place at the end of November.
They regularly rewrite prices for their products and other car manufacturers.
The volume of Russia ' s car market in monetary terms will be increased further - in addition to the lack of cars, it is an inflationary contribution, as well as the desire of the automobiles to lose the past losses, experts believe.
In the face of a car shortage, I think that many cars have even been able to transfer to the consumer the cost of past periods that they could not put into the price of cars before,
The VTB Capital analyst says on Vladimir Bespalov's highway.
I believe that in the financial perspective, car manufacturers are now feeling very well in favour of the high margin of sales."
The indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of the value of cars observed during 2021, the prices for new cars are rising faster, the expert specifies.
In the long term, markets will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly through inflation and the complexity of the construction of the machines themselves, Bespal predicts.
With increased opportunities for price increases, there will be limited opportunities.
In monetary terms, the Russian author will continue to grow even in the coming year, even if the cost of cars is slowed down, car manufacturers will be able to earn their income by volume, notes an independent consultant on Sergei Burgazliev.
In view of the increased demand and lack of supply, car manufacturers are now seeking the highest profit from each car sold, Burgasliev notes.
The increase in the production of cars is not expected at least in the near half of the year, while in Russia there is still an increase in public confidence in the future.
In the face of the market situation, cars have become a bad investment object - a purchased car year ago, even with a trial, the road can now be sold at the fair value, the expert notes.
Byiden spoke of the U.S. military transfer to Ukraine in the event of an invasion of Russia
The United States leadership has never considered sending US soldiers to Ukraine in the case of an invasion of Russia.
The U.S. President Joe Byden made that statement.
"There have never been such plans," said the head of the White House, answering the journalist's question whether the United States had rejected such an idea.
Byiden noted that if the situation around Ukraine was escalated, Russia would face economic consequences.
He stressed, however, that the United States and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using US troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine was not on the agenda.
Byiden explained that if Russia entered the territory of Ukraine, the United States would transfer forces to NATO (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flag, B9 -- all NATO countries that we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia," Baiden said.
The former Russian President's Press Secretary Dmitri Peskov stressed that Moscow did not have plans to enter the territory of Ukraine.
He pointed out that Moscow saw the problem in the military application of the drones issued by Kiev by Turkey, as well as that “American weapons are approaching our territory”.
