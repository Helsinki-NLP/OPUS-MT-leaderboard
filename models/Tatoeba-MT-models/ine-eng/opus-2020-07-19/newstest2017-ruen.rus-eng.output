Louis Galicia said that Frank was staying in the hotel first, but recently, "He's finally gone to bed."
"He found the apartment, he met the girl," Louis Galicia said to the KGB.
Luis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a great heart.
His way of communicating with his family has always been to prepare us some dinner, prepare us dinner," Luis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in anything.
He was a brother who was swimming on the run.

Scientists have found an animal that can live for 500 years
The International Group of Biologists concluded that the longest-lived vertebrate animal is a Greenland polar shark, which may live for some 500 years, transmits RT.
Scientists have conducted a radiocarbon analysis of 28 Greenlandic sharks.
The largest shark with a length of more than five metres may be 272 to 512 years.
Biologists believe that the long-term role of the shark is a low metabolism that leads to slow development.
The female Greenland sharks reach sexual maturity for only 150 years.
Previously, it was thought that the "neighbor" of the shark is a Greenland whale for a long time.
The oldest person known as the scientist was over 210 years old.

Should I go to the sanatorium if there's no health problem?
Our expert is the chief health doctor of Olga Bogus.
And if a healthy person just gets tired of work, does he have to go to the sanatorium?
We need health care not only for the treatment but also for the prevention of diseases.
Under the condition of the sanatorium, a person can check the condition of his or her body and receive advice from a doctor on how to live so that his or her health is not damaged.
Such recommendations will not be too much for anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal from the body, it doesn't have to be removed.
Persistent stress, mental and physical tiredness can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And the stress is about 90% coming.
He has the highest number of people in large cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it's best not to make things difficult and let yourself get some rest.
Studies show that 98 per cent of the population are lowering their biological age during their period of stay in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfortable rest for the entire family.
So if you want to leave with your children, you don't have to leave with them.
For children, even the youngest, health programmes include both diagnostic services, paediatric counselling, analysis and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's swimming pools), inhalation, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, curative physics.
The course of procedures shall determine the doctor taking into account the individual evidence and characteristics of the growing body.
In addition, in sanatoriums, a children's club usually works with animators, where children can attend games, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with young people, provide the necessary conditions and provide the services of an experienced nurse.
The soft winter, long summer, the rainy sunny days of the year (over 300) provide good conditions for round-year rest in the Caucasian Mineral Water resorts.
And then the body needs rest not just in summer.
So there is no fear of weather outside the window, as most procedures are in the room and are not dependent on the season.
Health care is generally desirable for 2 times a year, especially for adults.
The main fisque of the Caucasian Mineral Water region is, of course, the treatment of mineral sources: Slavyanovski, Smirnovski, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their water has unique properties and affects different systems of the body.
The water varies according to temperature, number of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor picks water depending on the patient's feelings.
So, Narzan has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory action, restores the function of the gastrointestinal tract and the exchange of substances.
Essentuki-4 affects the stomach-to-dwelling tract, reduces sugar levels.
"New essences" are anti-inflammatory, greedy and wet.
The same effects include Slavian water.
When appointing water, the doctor must take into account the condition of the heart-comfort system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it selects less salt water because the salts hold the fluid to increase the pressure.
The acceptance of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be consumed at a certain time, at the required quantity and at a specific temperature.
There are now various cosmetic procedures available for persons and bodies in the sanatorium.
What types of healing based on the natural characteristics of the North Caucasus can be found in the resorts of the region?
Near Pettgorska, for example, is the salty lake of Tambukan, adding a piece of which is useful for the systems, bells, internal organs.
It provides an anti-inflammatory, dissipating, immunomodulating action.
It's a healing walk on individual routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort (second in size in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is located close to the mineral source Narzan.
The baths can also be taken with wine, creamy, iodine-resistant, rural, sulfan-lacritic, depending on what your doctor will appoint.
Long-term fertility.
What do you do to make the harvest go by the end of the season?
As told by Julia Belopuchov, an agronomist and a daughter.
It is time for high-level atoms to set up a strip: to remove new pads, to cut mascots, to remove all leaves before the last brush with fruits and flowers with small binders - they can't harvest.
All tomatoes, regardless of the “constitution”, as well as prunes and beaks, are supported by a zole-superphosphate extract, processed by biopharmaceuticals (Spector - to accelerate the flow and growth of fruits, Phitosporin-M, Phytolavin, Gamair, Bactofit - from diseases, Immunocytophyte - to improve immunity, Bitoxybacillus, Lepidocid, and Fitoverm - if there are harmful).
Chemicals at the end of the summer should only be used with copper copper, colloidal sulphur and green soap.
We're doing the last crop.
The long-term heat-screws are soaked with the spleen that the lower, covered part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, drains the water and solution of the Circone, and soaks the 5-7 cm stem of the compound.
It is also not difficult to extend the fruition of the cabot: cut old leaves, pour hot water and solution of the complex well, put a fertile soil under the bush.
In order to protect from night colds, lay over a chain of hoses with cover material.
Keep the plants open on the day of the plant, and then close the sun.
The marks of the end.
What indicates that Russia is coming out of the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia's exit as long as the last twenty years of recession.
According to Bloomberg's analysis agency, GDP showed a positive trend, with GDP falling by 0.8 per cent in the second quarter of the year.
This indicator has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data, the drop in the Russian economy in the second quarter has slowed to 0.6 per cent.
The stabilization of the situation has also been reported recently by the Central Bank and the Minéconomocratic Development.
It's a slow growth.
In the opinion of the CBI experts, the recession in the Russian economy remained in the past.
"The index assessment of Russian GDP says that the recession is behind and ahead is a slow economic growth," says the Russian Bank's paper "What trends are talking about."
The module assessment of GDP in the current quarter of the regulator has increased to 0.4 per cent, with the fourth quarter being 0.5 per cent.
As reported by the representative of Minéconomy, the fall in RF's GDP in the second quarter was 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleansed GDP drop was 0.2 per cent to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the decline was stopped: in April it was 0.2 per cent, and in May and June, the change in GDP was between 0-0.15", quoted the representative of the MER RIA "Newste".
The slowdown in the Russian economy over the last five quarters indicates that “the past” has been achieved.
Among other markers showing signs of national economic recovery, Bloomberg calls for increased demand for electricity and rail transport, business recovery.
If an amendment is made to that year is high, it is clear that the energy consumption of more than 1 per cent may be partly due to an additional working day.
Add to this lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the increase in freight transport, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data here, and plus 0.5 per cent of the half-year volume can also be explained by season," explains Kirill Jacobenko from ALOR BROKER.
There are, however, other, more obvious signs of the stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lowering the price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month last year.
Moreover, the last two weeks of Rosstat fixed the deflation.
Russia's prices dropped for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the roulette course, which, although showing strong fluctuations in the beginning of the year, has increased by 12 per cent since early August.
It is also one of the signs of recovery for which indicators from the real sector of the economy have to go," says Jacobenko.
In addition, there has been an increase in industrial production since April in the RF.
In June, the rate rose by 1.7 per cent.
The rate of decline in external trade is slowed from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
Positive dynamics also demonstrate the situation in the labour market, where unemployment dropped to 5.4%.
It was only in September 2015 (5.2 per cent).
Despite the well-being of the labour market, the issue of real income will be left to the public to wish for the best.
The annual expression decreases by 4.8 per cent.
This factor can slow the recovery of the economy, as household costs contribute little to GDP.
As a rule, their share in the economy is above 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the strong policy of the Bank of Russia can also be called risk factors for economic growth.
The regulator maintains a rate of 10.5 per cent, which is not best affected by the real sector.
A negative factor is and is not sufficiently high in investment, which hinders industrial capacity development.
In general, however, the fall rate of the RF economy will be slowed to -0.5 per cent by the end of the year against -3.7 per cent in 2015," said GK analyst Forex Club Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and experienced in the winter sports in Olympiad, Sochi, until they develop so actively in summer sports.
If in the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and there are former foreigners, it is in most cases the natives of the former Republic of the Soviet Union.
Therefore, in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process - a sufficient number of Russians are under the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of the change of nationality varies.
Someone's parents have been taken to another country as a child without leaving a choice.
Someone has failed to compete for a place in the Russian assembly.
And someone thought that better conditions for development in sport would be created abroad.
Aif.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian nationality.
A 27-year-old girl's German passport says her name is Lisa Rice.
But she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omsk.
Only four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate in Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to go down the steps of her older sister, to pursue an easy athletic career.
Just like her sister, Lisa picked six beds.
Stay in Russia, if you'd hardly be able to move from the throne to Elena Isinbaev.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio Liz will be the only lander, even the former, in the six-bedroom sector.
Its best achievements in this kind of sport are the bronze of the 2010 European Championship and the silver of the continental championship in 2016, which it won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaeva.
The 29-year-old Elena Pirozkova was born in Novokusnecke in 1986.
Her parents are religious Protestants of the evangelical way.
Because of their faith, they went to the United States when the girl was only three years old.
Besides Elena, there were eight more children in the family.
They all lived in a small town in Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena started fighting at school.
With good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where the U.S. Training Centre continued to attend under the leadership of another former Russian Vladislav Izboijnik.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost her first grasp.
That's why the world champions won the same year.
Before that, she was able to win the silver at the 2010 World Cup.
After that, there were bronzes in 2013 and silver in 2014.
26-year-old Mary was born in the town of Yaroslavla, where she first met with synchronizing.
But it would be wrong to say that our coaches have raised her in Russia.
Soon the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
There Maria continued her activities.
Soon she had joined the United States and had shown wonderful results in the Pan-American games.
It is understandable that, at a serious international level, Russian synchronists can not compete, but for America, their indicators are a ceiling.
The new name, which sounds more strange in Russian, was received by Kristina Shaldibina at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue teaching the girl in the arts gymnastics after the ocean.
So far, the girl has been engaged in a favorite sport in the Yaroslavle family.
When she emigrated to the United States, she quickly entered the youth gathering in that country, and later joined the main national team.
At the American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For her first position on the world stage, she certainly did not have to fight, but for the United States she organized the current break - she brought the starry collection to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another one of our ex-girlfriends is Jana Berezko-Marggrandder, who is in favour of the German assembly.
She was born in Toledo.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more opportunities to become a national assembly.
Soon she had represented her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, it is true, Jana was able to occupy only 17 places that were not enough to compete in the final competitions in private.
That's why two years earlier she was able to win the bronze medal for the Olympic Games of Youth.
Another gymnast, only this time sport is Irina Sasonova.
If the means of emigration of the above-mentioned sportsmen can be called standard, the choice of the Irish family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is an educator of the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland, she was the champion of the country.
True, Ira is trained in Russia, however, and she comes to the family in particular so as not to lose her skills.
She's not as successful as she would like to be in Rio.
The best place is 40 in a private multiplicity.
There is very little information on Mary Ugolkov ' s fleet in the Russian information area.
For a very long time, Maria lives and is trained in Switzerland.
For a long time, however, she had spoken under the Russian flag, showing poor results - even a record of the country 200 metres away from the batterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and became a member of the red and white flag.
In Rio, its best speech is 14 places in the 4x100 complex.
In order to get into the game, the girl launched a Krowdfanding project that allowed her to collect about 6,000 francs that allowed her to pay for the Olympics.
The 31-year-old free-style fighter Adam Batirov spent almost all his career under the Russian flag.
At that time, Hasawurt's grandson was able to become a three-time champion of European champions, a Russian champion, an international sports master of Russia.
When he stopped falling into our national assembly, it was time to think about a change of nationality.
For a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from sports grounds.
The triumphal return took place at the 2016 Asian Championship - Batirov has already represented Bahrain, for which he won the gold medal and took a trip to the Olympics in Rio.
Another ex-rossian, Mikhail Kudinova, knows more about the family than even about the Swiss fleeting Maria Ugolkov.
It was his parents who emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was quite young.
It was there that Michael began to do sports gymnastics.
It did not achieve greater success at the international level.
In Rio, his best score was 40 seats on parallel brushes.
But for New Zealand, even falling into the Olympics in sports gymnastics is already broken.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There the girl continued her activities in synchronizing, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, a girl took 6th place in a synchronized swim at the European Championship in Berlin.
In the duet with Evgenie Tetelbaum Anastasia took eighth place.
She was the fifth in the solo program.
As with Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Croyer is in favour of the assembly of Israel.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to return to Israel.
In 2009, in 17 years Dmitria was the country's champion.
In the same year, he won a youth world championship.
A year later, Croiter won the gold of the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to the high beds, Dmitri has long and triple beds.
31-year-old Albert is another Hasaviurt native who, after long speeches to Russia, decided to change his sports nationality.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert has chosen Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia, he served as the School of Higher Sport in Krasnoyarsk, even becoming a country champion in 2011.
The 28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the SSSR gathering volleyball game Yaroslav Antonov.
A year before the birth of the son of Jaroslav, the best volleyballist of the world was recognized.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family remained there for a long time.
In 2015, he became the bronze champion of the European Championship, held in the territory of his new family.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and joined his family in the war.
Ten years later, parents decided to emigrate.
Norway was a real goal, but it was not possible for it to become a country - it had to go to France, to Nice.
There, Zelimhan continued to learn to fight.
He soon won the World Cup among young people and later qualified to participate in the Olympics.
In Rio he will be the only representative of France in the fighting tournament.
It's a free fight again, and it's a former Russian again.
This time it will be about the birth of the North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain, about Timor-Leste.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship, and he is currently supporting the country ' s collective team.
Before that, it was true that a 30-year-old sportsman had been able to score high scores in Russia as well.
He became the bronze champion of the country's 2007 and 2008 championships.
The Charter of Incompatibilities, Timuras decided to change sports nationality.
The last one on our list is a Czech boxer born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Mahakal, Arthur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took his family to Canada through Azerbaijan.
There Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, started boxing.
Since then, Arthur has been a Canadian champion three times, and in 2012 he has become a peace champion among young people.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won the Pan-American gold, the first for his new family since 1975.

Why do children have class speakers in schools?
According to Governor V. Condratiev, "we need to be raised, not by actions or by paradisaics, but by systems."
They must grow and at least seven years of age understand that they must be a speaker and education.
But as long as I think this work is done formally and I suspect it's more on paper.
I'd be happy if the speakers of the class put all the positive things that were stored before, at a quality new level.
If all is drunk and unknown, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
The CCC continues to be one of the most criminal sectors in the country's economy.
There is an impact on the resources allocated to the common area from budgets at different levels.
According to the Gender Procurator ' s Office, tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the field of GCC.
As a result, the region ' s consumers have paid over 170 million rubles to energy.

According to the investigation, as the head of the city facility repair fund, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, and the work on them was not actually done, but paid.
Businessmen just gave him a lot of money back.
And as the owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but the service providers did not pay and spent it on their own needs.
As a result, millions of rubles have been damaged by the budget and the housing.
Makarov's makeup scheme is typical of Russia.
There was a wave of arrests and detentions by UC leaders, who had committed money to citizens.
In Kamchatka, the trial against A. Kohan continues, including a former member of the forest, charged with fraud of 91.7 million rubles.

It is quite difficult to judge in the field of CWC.
Things aren't getting started, they're getting late.
And "helps" in this extremely confusing housing legislation - Svetlana Ravotneva, the executive director of NP "CH Control".
We do not have a single law, as we are thinking of a new one, which must force the previous one to work.
There are also few specialists, including judges, on the issue of CWC.
The lawyers themselves recognize that housing law is very low.
Refusals in criminal proceedings are also discussed by the Office of the Public Prosecutor.
Less than half of the crimes committed in 2015 are committed by 3.5 thousand.
According to the remaining investigation, it was of a long-term nature and each fifth was suspended due to the failure of the accused person.
There are often shortcomings in the activities of law enforcement authorities in the existing legislation.

In the five months of the current year, their number has increased only slightly - 99.
What is the falsification of the protocol of the gathering of the residents?

It turns out that the residents in the mines, small and medium-sized business, too.
First of all, through the elimination of corruption as such throughout the State, it is certain that Anton Jarkov, a member of the Parliament Committee on Property.
And now this work is actively being done.
It's not just a single action, it's a targeted course to combat corruption.
Of course, this is not the sad situation in all regions.
In particular, there are scandals in the capital and they don't smell.
Why is there no such scandals in Moscow in the area of GCH, as in many other regions?
For example, because the capital government has shown its will and order, the "Aif" told Anatoly Election, a member of the Committee of the Opinion on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I mean the staff issue, legislative amendments, and legal education.
The management companies have been duly supervised, and they have all been licensed.
Citizens' complaints are quickly resolved in public space (and the treatment of residents, and response measures are posted on the Government of Moscow portal).
Many do not simply pay monthly receipts, but they carefully follow what is written on the house.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and the obligations of resource and management organizations is very high.
In addition, Moscow examines the eligibility of housing and community services tariffs, as a small part of the budget is available for grants and benefits for many categories of population.
It's probably all together, and it explains the peaceful situation in Moscow.
Is everything supported by the regional authorities?
Maybe it's free to change the place of work?
Turkey's Gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to give up friendship with the EU and the United States?
Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has issued an ultimatum in the United States, proposing to make a choice between Turkey and Fathollah Gulen, an Islamic preacher charged with State conversion.
He said that in front of his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on Americans to give up their support for the "Terrorist Fetholachist Organization".
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States calls for a change in its position.
Experts believe that the gap between Turkey and the West is growing and could lead to a new attempt to change the country.
Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and the FETO ("Terrorist Fetholist Organization").
Or the organization of the FETO conversions, or the democratic Turkey.
It should make this choice," quoted the Anatolian Agency for the Treatment of Erdogogan, which appeared on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The President of Turkey on a regular basis, but it had already demanded the United States to comply with his request, which they had first sounded after the siege.
It is recalled that on the night of 16 July Turkey ' s high-ranking Turkish army tried to force a legitimate government in the country, as well as attempted to lead the State.
However, after Recep Erdogan addressed the population, the dispute was crushed and its organizers and participants were arrested.
A total of some 8,000 people were suspected of becoming teachers and scientists, besides the military.
According to Recep Erdogan, their teacher was Fethollah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, U.S.A.
Also, Erdogogan supporters have allowed the Americans to be involved in the coup.
All claims were rejected, refusing to issue Guyana and advising it to change the tone.
The last statement made by the representatives of Mr. Herdegaan on this account was made at the time of his visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey - it insists on it and also imposes demands on other Western partners.
"The Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under a migration agreement with the Euro Union if Brussels does not call the date of the abolition of visa restrictions on Turkish citizens," said Turkey's EU Minister for Affairs Omer Chelic on 9 August.
He said that, as the EU requires, the amendment of Ankara to the anti-terrorism law would threaten Europe's own security.
It should be noted that on 1 August, German Deputy Chancellor Zigmar Gabriel requested Turkey to end the EU's commitment to opening the borders for migrants to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words were in response to the relevant statement made by the Head of the IID of Turkey, Mevluta Chavuchoglu.
Another provocative statement made by Chavuchoglu last Wednesday, allowing Turkey to leave NATO.
The head of Turkish MID did not rule out that the country would consider leaving the alliance if it did not meet its expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the field of defence is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign defence States - import rockets," Chavushoglu said in an interview with Anadolu.
He said that Turkey now needed to establish its own defence system based on its technology and to cooperate with other countries.
"Turkey has been trying to cooperate with NATO member countries so far, but the results have not met us, and we have been looking for others," the Minister said.
The experts believe that all of this refers to Turkey ' s serious differences with the West and the country ' s orientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise of Eugenie Minechenko believes that Redzep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go to a severe confrontation with the West.
He is very involved in both the West and business, and in the military (Turkey is a NATO member), so I think Erdogan will try to balance with the West by maintaining a framework for relations with the West.
Although, of course, it would be easier for Americans to see a fully obedient person in this position," explained the AIF.ru expert.
According to him, it was not ruled out that after the Turkish leader's statements (on the non-payment of compensation from the EU, the requirement for visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Guyana from the United States) would be imposed on him.
"Rejep Erdogan will face the deterioration of relations with both America and the European Union, and they will press on it on humanitarian issues, for the dictatorial methods of managing the country and so on," says Minchenko.
The Head of the Political Information Centre, Alexei Muhin, admits that the President of Turkey is changing his view of relations with Russia as soon as he finds it beneficial.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took a very strict position with regard to Russia and sought favor in every way in the West.
For a very short time, the situation had changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that the President of Turkey will no longer change his priorities for a while.
I think Erdogan entered the period of primary diplomacy.
If he is between the two Poles - West and Russia - he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself," Muhin thinks.
He believed that the main task for the President of Turkey today was to maintain political power in the country, and that he needed Russia and partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop supporting the United States.
Turkey needs both the EU and the United States, which control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, consensus will be reached with Turkey," the expert believes.
In other words, the head of the Asia and the Middle East is Anna Glazza.
Turkey's relations with the EU and the United States are now strained enough, and this is primarily related to the internal policy that Erdogan is conducting.
I think that this crisis will be aggravated in terms of relations, and in the face of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to recharge both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
Turkey's President, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, have said that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, that relations with Israel have been resolved, that there is an active political interaction with Iran," explained Aif.ru Glaza, explaining that the next step will be to normalize relations with Egypt.
According to her, Erdogan's current policy is the return to the foreign policy concept followed by Turkey before the beginning of the Arab revolutions.
"It was then that Turkey began to develop very active relations with the Middle East and the Asian region in the "no problems with its neighbours".
There have now been very successful visits by the President of Turkey to Russia and the African countries.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey's positions both at the regional and international levels," the expert believes.
The vote believes that Turkey's return to former relations with the EU will be incredibly difficult, and now the question is whether the EU will begin to respond strongly to Turkey, which can go to the opening of borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
The slaughter of young doctors: Calls for new collective protests
Young doctors asked the trade union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over a new employment contract.
The Committee of Young Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) intends to request its full board to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC said that ministers could not answer questions about the employment contract.
Young doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel the contract of employment agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members published on Twitter Thursday evening, President JDC Ellen McCort said that the Government continued to "keep silent" about the problems that she said had led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said, “In view of the situation, the leader of JDC voted against the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiation on all your issues”.
In response to the silence of the Government, the leader of JDC today made an official request to the extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve a continuous programme for the expansion of collective protests from early September.
The struggle led young doctors to participate in six strikes this year, including the first universal strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of BMA doctors, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after voting to cancel the agreed terms of the employment contract that BMA recommended.
He told the BMA members that the deal was good to be made during the meetings before the vote of 54,000 young doctors and medical students.
Following the vote, the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the employment contract would be used for medical workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: Alliance Bad?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the golden court hall in St. Petersburg, I had a lasting impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
It was handcuffs, yes.
But Mr. Putin's smile seemed to be overcrowded, and he barely made it warm even on his own held standards.
Regzep Tayip Erdogan, in contrast, has repeatedly referred to his "other dear" Mr. Putin, five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level but even above.
On the next day, one newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm was supposed to be back.
But the prolonged cold coming from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in the introductory remarks: Turkey had beaten the Russian fugitive on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was unstoppable.
Mr. Putin was angry with the angry tyrade, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
Grief was even stronger on the basis of the alleged friend.
The restoration of real trust would be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, the media-controlled State conducted a shocking, total attack on Ankara.
It appeared suddenly that the Turks should be held guilty in all.
The most serious charges were the allegations by senior officials that Mr. Erdogogan's own family was engaged in illegal oil trade in the Syrian zone controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He firmly denied it.
But in St. Petersburg, an official signal came, and it was time to move on.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Mr. Putin had received an apology he had requested from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim victory for its kind.
For Ankara, the benefits of the proclamation of peace are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he's almost turned off his post last month while trying to convert.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also clearly shocked him.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit heavily — especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen sharply by almost 90 %.
With regard to Russia, tour operators and charter companies here, of course, feel relief when flights finally resume.
They put on the peak end of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, public television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," said the report in the newspaper Vedomosta.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara's evil in the West because she thinks it's a weak response to a conversion attempt.
Add to this her prolonged dissatisfaction with the sharp pace of the EU accession talks and Mr Putin's move, which seeks to enjoy the cold and gradually destroy Turkish relations with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won the winning rounds with Ankara for calling for the support of the elected authorities after a coup attempt.
Consider this data for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of changing the regime.
So, the summit in this shining palace on the seashore allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as a "evil alliance": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West unite forces.
Nevertheless, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two remain at a significant disadvantage.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing parties.
He may have said for himself that, after almost three hours of initial negotiations, until two presidents gave the press conference, they had not even touched on the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided the answer to the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin chose to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility, and taking into account the possibility of a complete disaster when a member of NATO struck a Russian-reactive fugitive, it was better that at least two leaders were talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
Brand RBS should be relegated to the back office, according to the Bank's Executive Director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the Bank's global ambitions.
The bank has withdrawn from them since he moved almost eight years ago and had to be saved.
During this period, brand strategies used RBS to protect other consumer credit brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds of sponsorial assistance to international sport, from Cuba to the Wymbledon andy Murrey Championship.
But it was now decided that it was right to allow more national fires to come out first.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external principal office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already being used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking services that will be more influenced by Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan interviewed clients and staff in Invernessshire during the tour.
He said to BBC Scotland: "Brend RBS will eventually become our investment brand and the one in which our staff will be employed, because we are now becoming more brand banks."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying now that we have no more global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in its population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship support to the six nations of Cuba, and it increases the profile of various brands in sponsoring sport.
"This is the right time for us to drive a brand bank, because on the basis of (we asked ourselves) how we focus on improving the bank for customers?" said the Executive Director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and we would close all these brands.
But with the work we've done, focusing on the needs of customers, not our own, I think you've seen a lot of changes.
We can return those fires again, so I think it's time.
Franki Dettori comes to 3,000 winners with a victory in New Market at the Priorities.
The detectives scatter the champagne after the double in New Market brings it to 3,000 wins
Jokoy Franki Dettori won his 3,000th British victory in New Market on Friday.
He came to this outstanding note by means of his second winner on his home road at the Prestratia, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who has reached this outstanding mark in smooth jumps.
It follows Sir Gordon Richards, Long Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Idder and Willie Carson.
A three-time detective jockey champion who once won the Ghayyar said, "This is something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here, too.
I'm very glad this happened in Newmarket, because I moved here 30 years ago.
It's not a big world event, it's not a Royal Ascot -- it's a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free from cases and I'm very unconcerned.
The children receive applause when they make a predisposition after victory
Two jockeys achieved this in obstacles: Richard Johnson's jockey champion and 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4300 wins for a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time winner Derby, 4493 career wins
Franki is one of the best jockeys of modern times, and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark, which so few have reached.
He's stylish and strong, but that's his tactical smack that distinguishes him from others in the summer room.
He was a great representative for jumping, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans in this sport for years.
I told Franky a few weeks ago in Epse, he'd have brought 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a jogging jumper!
And if you're serious, Franky has brought the winners to Britain for over 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energetic character that's good for British jumpers, but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Franki Dettori highlighted this outstanding sign of a firm's racing match with horses.
From the speedy finish to the speedy jumps, Frankie Dettori is a symbol of British smooth jumps for two decades.
It's been taken and dropped.
Many of the winners of the big jumps, including his famous Velikolep Semerka in Ascote in 1996, but he also survived the aviation and attempted disqualification due to doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge skeptics and return to form.
And he may not have finished for some time. Dettori said earlier that he would like to continue to participate in the competitions, at least by the age of 50.
Putin releases Sergei Ivanov's head of administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his head of the administration of Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a part of the trusted neighborhood of Putin for many years.
This 63-year-old has now been appointed as a representative of the environment and transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin “set Ivanov free from his duties as head of the Russian President's administration”, but did not mention the reason.
Mr. Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Wayne, was appointed his successor.
Mr. Wayne, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he was the head of the President's protocol and the Government's apparatus, reports the Kremlin website (Russian).
At the time of his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as heads of State in the development of draft laws and control of how your instructions are being implemented.
Putin told a Russian TV channel Friday that Ivan had asked him to be released from the post and recommended that he be replaced by Vienna.
Do you believe the smiles?
It's a move that's been set by Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has been one of the closest supporters of Vladimir Putin for a long time and, like him, has served in the Soviet Security Service, the KGB.
As Head of Administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on public television, both men stated that the head of the administration had resigned on his own request.
But despite the smiles on the camera, few people have been convinced here — especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these unforeseen consequences of any power struggle?
Until no one knows.
But the official statement is that a person who was once agitiated as a potential president suddenly wanted to govern Russian environmental policy was confronted with enormous skepticism.
In Putin's comments, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "This is true that in early 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this very difficult post, even if it could be said, a four-year problem post.
Well, I've been head of the President's Administration for four and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He was a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the Public Security Service of the KGB, as was Mr. Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which was replaced by the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
At one time Ivanov was considered to be the President of Russia after Putin's second term, as Putin's third term would be contrary to the Constitution.
However, this post was taken by another close associate of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency three and a half years later.
The star of Thomas Gibson's "I Think He's a Criminal" series released after the deal with the producer.
Gibson was involved in the shooting of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce series, announced their release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotner, apologized Thursday before his removal was announced.
There were creative differences in plots and differences in opinion.
I'm sorry this happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how the Gibson character will be removed from the show, which will be followed by the FBI agent team, is expected to be later, according to statements by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who had previously played a major role in the ski resort Darma and Greg, was on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love "I think as a criminal" and I have put my heart and soul in it for the past twelve years," Gibson said in his statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there before the end, but now it's not possible.
I would just like to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our remarkable team, and, above all, the best worshipers that the show could only dream of.
It is noted that the show will return with its twelfth season on 28 September.
A mystery: Fish landed in Banfa Garden
A man from Banfa sought help to identify the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Baine believes 75 fish could be sands left with water dead.
Bane, who lives 500 metres from the sea, put a plot of this farm in Periscope in the hope that someone will be able to shed light on the appearance of two dozen fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected with Fief
Project of 1.35 billion pounds now to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have joined the North Spring and the Queensferry Crossing Vaoduk — which means that the bridge is now connected to Fief.
This is the first of the four screws between the fires of the canvas, which are now approaching the completion of all three bridge pilots.
The Fief Bridge section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contained 10,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of bridge.
The $1.35 billion project is now to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Kit Brown visited the square today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queenspherry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of engineering truly epic in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete and have been used only to build this part of the bridge.
In spite of the mass size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the mixing between the vaodoo and the bridge is a virtuoso operation using extremely accurate assembly permits.
A total of about 79 per cent of the entire bridge deck is now on the ground, and for the last section of the deck, the concrete cover is on the Rosite today, which means that everything is ready to climb to the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Director Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first swing on each bridge project is always a significant wave.
In this stunning project, this mixture is the most modern construction art.
After the last section of the road sign and its connection with the expanding North Pillar sign, we were then left to close the remaining barrier on the north — or the shoreline.
This was done by raising the northern approach to 700 millimetres south.
It was a large and at the same time a very good operation.
It is large, because the veaduk length 222 metres, weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be raised at the angle of about 3 per cent.
It is understandable because the tolerances that the team was working on were fragile — just a few millimeters in each direction.
Luckily, it all went very well.
Rescue in Moelfr Bay: Three men were "lucked to stay alive"
Three men were "lucked to stay alive" after they were released from the fishing vessel in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station was alarmed at 13:20 in British summer time on Friday, after the team saw the incident taking place in Moelfr Bay.
Three men were trying to reach a safe place, while their ship continued its journey.
"We saw their ship circling around with them and assumed the worst," said Moelfri Vince Jones.
"Happyly, by the time we went down to the water, the strong wind took him away from them," he added.
Two men were saved through a local fishing vessel, and a third man was found exhausted and trapped without a lifesaver.
All of them were boarded on a beach lifeboat and delivered to a rescue station.
Jones said, "The three men who have been thrown into the water have been lucky to be alive and completely harmless.
The boat's engine had an accident trigger, but it somehow got rid of the man who was running the boat when she woke up.
Someone's been watching these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It's exciting to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go to the streets to play, preferring to spend their free time watching the screen, has been a complaint to many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go poisons people from the couch and involves some physical activity.
Time in the screen was initially limited by television, then by video and recently by smartphones.
It is so good to see that technology and street activity are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the slow involvement of Pokémon Go, an annex based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (after the series of films, play cards and other responses).
Like many other pop-cultural events, all of this has lost relevance a little earlier than this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launch in other countries was held back at the time due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
In the days considered, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, smartphone players are going to look for Pokemons that are tracking the GPS and, being found, can be 'photographed' (through the box on your phone) or 'recorded'.
The generation that played the game, being younger, joined in the slow pursuit, ridding themselves of the giants to search for them.
In the United States, the game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "normal" person every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which tracks 35,000 users, recently reported Washington Post that within two days from the start of the game, the number of people who tracked them, who had performed 30-minute exercises daily, jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing in Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data on the transition levels.
Many health campaigns that convince people to "at least 30 minutes", "get up from the couch" and "be active every day", have found no response because most health messages are boring and express themselves to people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to adjust weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that she pushes people on the street to do what they love.
Thus, the three basics of health are: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends in the hunt.
Usually, there are unwanted pregnancies that seek to complain about.
And yes, someone can knock on the door.
So what?
It's a break.
Because even though smartphone applications, such as Fitbit, were able to track our physical activity before, they didn't give us a chance to practice, as this game does.
The news is coming, and the use will slow down in time.
However, because of the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to want to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simona Bails wins the gold of the absolute championship in female gymnastics
Forget about the pressure.
Forget about the sum.
Simon Bails is invincible for all of this.
It's dynamic on the back of the bed.
Unencumbered.
That's a sex breaker.
That's amazing.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went up to the title of an absolute championship on Thursday, putting the rest of the world into a convincing demonstration at the attention of the Olympics.
Its total score was 62.198 enough to remove the silver medalist and the partner of the final Peterka team, Eli Riceman and the Russian bronze medalist Ali Mustafin.
Bails from the United States is in the gymnastics market during the finals of the women's individual gymnastics championship in 2016 of the Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byyles became the fourth-ranking American woman who won the title of the champion of the absolute championship and the fifth in all, confirming her reputation as the best of her generation and, perhaps, at any time.
She was upset when they showed her final general ball and her long journey to this point ended.
This achievement puts her in the same league as very rare athletes, such as Michael Felps, who have raised their sports to new heights:
Miles spent the last three years mastering his sport by winning 15 medals at the world championship -- including 10 gold -- with such horrifying programs in their mix of passion and precision that the 1984 Olympic Championship, Mary Lou Retton, called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One final test was waiting for Brazil, not as much a match between the Bayls and the others in this field as between her and the burden of overdue expectations.
Anything less than going back to his family's home in Spring, Texas, with the worst gold medals, would be considered an unwarranted expectation.
Simon Bails from the United States, on the left, and Eli Riceman, are held after winning gold and silver, respectively, at the final of the women's individual absolute championship in the Summer Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Miles earned the first gold on Tuesday, became a beautiful final deal for a simple party leaving the coordinator of the National Assembly of Martha Caroli.
While Miles insisted that she never looked forward to the future during her long journey to the top, that was not the case.
Part of her free exercise program — including her corporate tour — is set up in Latin American music, which would come directly from home on the street right outside the Olympic Arena Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was widowed by her grandfather and grandmother, starting to walk with a child and an open mother of coach Amy Burman during a visit to the hall where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She did not lose any competition for an absolute championship since the summer of 2013, which should continue as long as Miles wants.
Although Mustafin had a small advantage with two treatments, it was a peace.
Gymnastics and free exercises — where the Bayls defend the name of the world champion — lie in ambush.
She went out again from 15,433 in the spring and ended from 15,933 in the field.
Raisman gently hugged her while they were waiting for the final account — pure formality — and tears appeared around the shining red with white and blue bass for the eyes of the Bayls when the idea that she had ever written in the cut album came true.
Raisman's speech was a small place four years ago when she divided the third place, but lost Mustafa's bronze in Thai.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which Americans call a "baby" was a lot ahead of him.
She sent a kiss to a crowd after her free exercise, covered by a return that sometimes appeared to be on the subject.
With regard to Bayls, the virus tweet 19 years from the beginning of this week is now absolutely new:
Police: 3 victims in the serial killer case shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the most deadly attack on the first Finnish serial killer in the last decade, sat in the car, spoke and listened to the music when they were shot, according to the police report published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefani R. Ellis and the daughter of Ellis, Malia, were shot on 12 June when their car was parked on the road, the authorities said.
The offender made about eight shots of the gun, standing on the passenger side of the vehicle, then hiding on another vehicle, is reported in the report.
The police claim that the triple murder is apparently not the result of robbery, since the perpetrator has not taken any wallets or $2,900 in possession of one of the adult victims.
The Finnish police representative, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting had prompted investigators to check whether he had been involved with the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others were injured as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas for four months.
"This is happening in the residential area ahead of home," said Howard KHO, the CBS branch, early this month.
The suspect was believed to have used several vehicles, including the Korean Nissan end of the 1990s, the black BMW end of the 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, aged 33, was hospitalized with injuries and ended later.
Liner, 31 years old, and the daughter of Ellis, Malia, died on the spot.
The Witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to the music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, aimed at half an hour before the triple murder and believed to have been the case of a serial killer.
The trackers found the bricks and pulled the rifle out of the seat and the parts of the rifle out of the motor compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with a microcephalus: "It's getting better"
Like most of the six - year - olds, Edmund Pixivto loves drinking, playing games, and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his captors, Edmund's microcephalus is the result of a genetic violation that his mother Elizabeth Pixivto did not know at the time of pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I could not do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign it.
What really isn't true is, of course, you sign on to it," she said.
Her and her husband told Vincent that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized medical facility.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing that," Pixyvto explained.
Edmund walks through the halls.
Edmund didn't sit or use until he was three, and he hasn't spoken yet.
But it's slowly going through some stages.
He's on the sidewalk and he's riding on a bike.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and drink.
Elizabeth is showing the gesture that Edmund was thinking of "Please call me."
"We're learning his sign language," said Picxivto CBS News.
But not just the usual language of gestures, she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur due to a variety of different circumstances: genetics such as Edmunda, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as crust and Zika.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary considerably.
It's too early to talk about how it's going to affect the lives of those infected with Zika virus.
Pixivto recalls the emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
I always said what's going to happen?
What's going on?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a lifetime forecast because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Pixivto has a encouraging advice for mothers of children with congenital defects due to Zik.
It'll get better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flood is the cause of rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
The strong rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state by Saturday.
Many rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and South Mississippi have left the shores and are threatened with widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Meteorological Service reported.
Governor Louisiana John Bell Edwards said that government officials were in constant contact with local authorities and assistance had already gone to the affected incomes.
Mike Styl, representative of the Governor ' s Office on National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that high-water, boat and sandbag transport requests were being made.
Styl said that only Tangipoha's income asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The danger of flooding remains in force until Saturday for most of southern Louisiana.
The Meteorological Service stated in the statement that additional 3 to 5 inches could be swallowed on the area.
In southern Alabama, a rainy trip took place until Friday, as the rain continued to reach the Mobila area.
The Comit River near Baton-Ruze and the Eimit River near Dene Springs, both in Louisiana, were projected to establish a record of the flood level in the past exits.
Synoptic Alex Krautmann said that both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton-Russia.
He also said that the flooding down at Assensen's arrival was a threat, as these high-flowing rivers would slowly reach the Morp Lake.
Tikfo River, the southern border of Mississippi in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest ever recorded level at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers were still pushing people from the floodwaters in the districts of Emit and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and pastry were among those who were saved early Friday next to Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that the waters of Bever Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, were quickly up at night.
He said that the other passerby, who lives nearby, had warned him.
"We woke up, and the water kept going," said Hansford.
She reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the biggest flood she'd seen in 48 years of living here.
Hansford said he and all his family had disabilities, and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that rescue workers saved all three with the help of an army truck and delivered them to a fire station in Gloster where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood was “quickly spreading”, as the rains continued, noting that officials were considering the evacuation order.
Croutmann says that one observer outside Livingstone reported a fall of 13.75 inches from midnight until Friday morning.
Croutmann said that the soil was recharged with rainfalls from the environment.
The heavy rain and the flooding of the streets have led to the rescue of residents from the homes of Tangipagoa and the abolition of five school districts, states the authorities.
WWL, the branch office of CBS, reports that Counsellor Tanjipahoa spoke of 200 warm homes.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but both of them are now being burned.
The President of Robbie Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals in high water.
The receptions were opened in the city of Emit and Hammond to receive those who had been evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water starts to drop," he said.
In the town of Hammond, Tanjipahoa, about two dozen streets were closed because of high water levels, and sandbags were available to deliver to residents in the hope that they would keep the water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said urban manager Lacey Landrum.
It's on its way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the Head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey, reported that the rainy rain continued to rise on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
According to him, several houses were registered as heated on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, the store manager of Shopper Value Foods in Emit, lives in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Tausson, "and she's still flying to the ground."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "pulled by bullets", remains alive after shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording a 6-year-old shot in the city this week.
His grandmother and granddaughter introduced him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandma and Grandpa say Brown received multiple gunshot wounds, including his breath, leg, hand and life, but was aware of when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got a lot, his little body was cut off by bullets," says his grandmother Delores Melandez.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is counted in the hospital in critical condition and has survived several operations.
The family told the station what was expected of him.
He had to go to first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown.
They also shot three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
It is reported that one of the 29-year-olds was in critical condition; two other victims were registered in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot at the front seat of the car near the critical 29-year-old, reports the station.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be shot.
The investigators report to CBS Philadelphia that it appears that there was a shooting among several armed people.
Giles of semi-automatic weapons attributed to various copies of semi-automatic weapons have taken place.
This seems to have been a long battle.
There were bricks on the street, on both sides of the road.
So, according to all, there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting," said police captain Anthony Jinaldi.
Many homes and cars in the area have also been planted.
No arrests were made, and the police reportedly watched video surveillance cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was beaten in the hands of a crazy jumper Tuesday when she played in front of her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby, and Lori?
That's what I call a woman's Olympic gymnast this year and for several reasons.
First, I have been to every Summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And the second is that three gymnasts are involved: Simona Bailz, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lori" Ernandes, who have inspired so many black girls.
The composition of this collection, supplemented by Eli Riceman, who is a Jew, and Madison Coshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This collection looks like America at last.
This has also strengthened the black and Latin American women ' s presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the female gymnasium number was one African American.
Last year Simon and Gabby were Nos1 and No2.
It's powerful.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed him.
The world could now be a witness of the incredible three-time World Championship of Simon Bayls, Douglas and Lori Ernandes, who are performing unexpected, yet virtuoso gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday Simon became the fourth American gold medal winner in a female individual absolute championship.
And a fellow at Eli Reisman's collection made a silver one.
We're witnessing this kind of sport, but it doesn't look like it in gymnastics all over the country.
Simona, Gabby, and Lori all chose the same path as Ellie and Madison to form an Olympic assembly.
They are "final five", because the next Olympic gymnast will have only four gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year of Martha Caroli's training.
But gymnastics is really expensive sport, and gymnasts are first trained in private gymnastics clubs supported by parents paying for training, equipment, travel, form, contributions to competitions, hotel services (for coaches and their gyms and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gym clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are located where gymnasiums get everything from their training, and it is a expensive and long-term responsibility for gymnastics families.
Amy Burman, coach Simona Bayles, and Maggie Hani, coach Lori Ernandes, both trained their sportsmen since they took up gymnastics.
We must create a more affordable and affordable education for gymnastics communities of a small number of young girls inspired by Simon, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gymnasium fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and low-cost gymnastics, located in Harlem, for more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Latin American) and raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnasts for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops power, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as sustainability for the exhausting work, discipline and resilience for the mind.
This combination has a positive effect on good health, school success and work throughout life.
It's the inspiration of this collection that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and that's wonderful.
Sports is so important, especially for girls.
It's such a great time now.
Thank you, Simona, Eli, Lori, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Force in winning the commandal Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of different origin to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Younger doctors took the notice of further beatings following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers hoped to conclude the dispute over the changes by agreeing an amended treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the treaty, said that NHS was on "no ground" and any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in working hours at night and exits to improve services at extra-hours.
Dr. Ellen McCott, Chairman of the Committee on Young Doctors" BMA, said yesterday evening in a statement: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that it is undergoing a crisis of labour force and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly.”
It was only eight weeks before the first group of doctors was transferred to a new contract, required progress, and time on the basis.
The attempt by WMA to resolve the dispute in the negotiations was met with an unwillingness to take action and sometimes with full silence by the Government.
And this despite the promise by Jeremy Hunt last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Khantu needs to act now, encourage introduction and respond to the fears of younger doctors.
If he does not do so, then the younger doctors are sure that they are ready to organize the subsequent beatings.
At the end of April, about 13,000 scheduled operations and 100,000 hospital admissions were delayed, while nurses and consultants were involved in providing medical replacement on the picketing line.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing an amended treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants a better payment for 54,000 young doctors who will be subject to the treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS Employers, urged younger doctors not to continue beating.
Mortimer said: "The strikers reach little or nothing, but they put pressure on those already working on the edge of the teams and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and distress to patients, residents and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Young Doctors and, in conjunction with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of supervisors and corporate information policies.
Workers hoped that the continued positive support on other important topics, such as staff distribution, flexibility of education, additional training for those returning after a career break, the value of education, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay gap in medicine, were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were going to comply with the conditions achieved by WMA in November, February and May.
2 £ per day may reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart patients are going to use $2 a day after the authorities have recommended that they give it to a larger number of people and for longer periods.
The anti-inflammatory drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrences for people with heart disease.
The product is already designated for 12 months after heart attack, reduced risk of stroke or new onset.
The NICE National Health Service advised the UK to give it to its people for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE National Health Service has now advised the UK to give it to its people for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack takes place with approximately 140,000 people in England each year, and four more attacks or strokes occur.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fat on the walls of the arteries and the formation of blisters.
If the vial is broken down into parts, this may be the cause of a thrombosis that blocks blood access to the heart and causes heart attack.
And if the tromb moves, it can move through the blood stream and block the blood to the brain, causing the stroke.
People who have already taken one approach are at greater risk of getting another.
Tikagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk by making the tubes less likely.
The NICE project, published today, recommends that people give 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Evaluation Centre, said: “Despite the effective methods of secondary prevention of approximately four people who have had a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke often has devastating effects”.
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already undergone heart attack.
We are pleased to have the opportunity to increase the treatment available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it in advance.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially the risk of bleeding, is limited to three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment for a longer period of time.
The culture of ownership of the PC enables the falsification of the count of votes in the Muslim regions
Ex-Mer Tower-Hamlets Lutfur Rachman was removed from office last year because of corruption, using a government account
The culture of political correctness has led to the closing of the eyes, which has been turned around by the widespread falsification of the count of votes in the Muslim communities, according to information from the destruction report of the Government published today.
The former member of the Cabinet of Ministers, Sir Eric Pickles, is intimidating with the criticism of the police, election observers and city administration for ignoring evidence of election violations due to “excessive sensitivity to racial affiliation and religion”.
The former secretary of local communities, now the anti-corruption king, reported that the fear of religious voters was so strong that the police had to allow border crossings to protect the fearsome voters.
He proposed that voters take identity certificates to prove who they were when they voted.
To date, voters must only specify their name and address.
The report even proposes to put unsweetened blacks on people's fingers when they submit their ballots, in order to exclude someone from voting twice.
There is a need to provide better protection to the public, Sir Eric said.
He called for greater press access to local council documents and decisions adopted by informal committees or working groups.
"This is done not only to protect against fraud in elections, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that is going hand in hand with it," he said.
A report was made to the Downing Street due to a scandal with a vote in Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, the Special Court, considering election issues, decided that the current mayor, Luftur Rachman, had to be removed from office in relation to a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rakhman had "skinned" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and had forced his critics to silence them, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rachman said, "He had his campaign based on the duty of believing Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes cast doubts or were the result of a person ' s vote, representing someone else.
Sir Eric said there were false testimony throughout the country.
He was particularly concerned about the fraud of the mail vote in which the senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressured people to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric, in his photo, made several recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including the requirement to give his identity certificate to prove who you are.
His report stated: “The evidence of the pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, was provided to vote at the will of the older, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
“It was feared that... public institutions had closed their eyes to such behaviour due to the excessive sensitivity of “political correctness” to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on system cleaning, including the removal of political activists from work with postal ballots to stop the “collection of votes”.
The report of Teresa May also calls for rigorous registration checks to prevent the use of a list of voters for immigration fraud and privileges.
An option is being considered to require the voters to submit an identity certificate before the vote.
Use unscrupulous ink on people's fingers as soon as they release their ballots to prevent someone from voting twice.
To carry out systematic checks on people ' s nationality to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Enter a three-year limitation on applications for automatic mail vote.
Remove political participants from the campaigns and activists from the work of filled ballots and postal ballots.
To empower the police to establish borders around electoral sites.
To amend the law to facilitate the prosecution of persons in intimidation under the Representation of the National Act of 1983.
To take illegal photographs at the polling stations.
To require only English to be used in electoral sites (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that the staff force the voters to go to the booth one by one.
Sir Eric was furiously attacking the city police, claiming it was "suffering", that no criminal charges had been brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The electoral court disqualified Lutfur Rachman and his agent for a long list of corruption and illegal acts,” he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of any reasonable doubt — a criminal proof standard — for a number of reasons.
It also criticises the resultsless "tests for the gallop" of the electoral registration divisions of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: "The earlier court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a sign of prosecution.
Our nation has a proud heritage like the mother of the parliamentary elections, yet the alarming and secret dissemination of electoral fraud and the denial of some organs threatens that good reputation.
Mindful of Kate's bicycle analog and other two-star Olympics in Rio
The 2016 Olympic fans in Rio this week came up with the idea of a French bicycle driver Polin Ferran-Prevo, which appeared to be impressive like the Duke of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old participant in the Olympics is not the only sportsman fighting for gold this summer, who can be praised by his own famous twin, at least, according to communications in the neighborhoods.
Thus, in favour of Game Rio and all the famous people on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has made a list of the Olympics that have more than a superficial similarity to the Hollywood Star.
Hunter and wolf: U.S. male teammate Brady Ellison, on the left, compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to two Kates on a bicycle road, many people have rushed online to point out how a certain tower could be a twin of the superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
A member of the U.S. men's team, Brady Ellison, was the cause of a hurricane in Twitter after his images appeared, which looked like a horrendous Volk star with Wallstreet.
And in fact, the maid learned about the insanity of the soccess and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
"I don't personally see a huge similarity, it may be except for vegetation on the face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly show even more this year: the striking similarity between British ensign Greg Raserford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast, Ali Mustafin, with her large, expressive eyes, is said to be an exact copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the Basin of Southern Africa, Cameron Van Der Burg has been comparing himself to the star of Mount Mattie Morrison for many years.
Going to more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is a "sport version" of the "Start" actor.
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who can be praised by similar heavy holes and lips.
A silver medalist from Russia, Julia Efimova, can be praised not only with the same tanned skin and bright hair as Annalinn McCord's actress, while Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, according to fans, is like Joseph Gordon Levitta's "sport version."
Heavy Women: The Hope Solo Football Star, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, right, have the same forms of face and eye
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similarities
Creating the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason based on the appearance of the pair
One Twitter user recently called on the site to announce his caution that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter really are identical".
In fact, the U.S. football star and Dexter's actress have an amazingly similar form of face and eye.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of the actress Lori Linnie, as well as the winning golden medal by Gabby Douglas, who can boast of his own beautiful wide smile, which resembles the smile of the star Gabriel Junion.
Olympiada's commentary to CBC is apologizing for saying that the Chinese fleet "died like a pig"
Analyzing Byron McDonald's fourth place at the end of the 14-year-old Ay Janhan at the women's stadium, 4x200 m in the middle of CBC viewers in the direct broadcast of the Olympics
The Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese raft "started as he" and "dead as a pig" during the flood.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought that his microphone was turned off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final female stage 4x200 m in free style.
It was possible to hear McDonald, who was called to the CBC's team of commentators to "distribute her color," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese has run out of the ball, kid."
She was too excited, started out like a pig, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
A 14 - year - old Chinese cyclist, Ay Janhan, missed the second stage of the estaphy at 1:57.79 — for 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Rack, allowing Canadians to remove their distance from China.
Viewers throughout Canada reacted quickly to the network after being shaken by tone and using expressions
Emmet McFarlene tweeted, "Is it really the CBC dictator who just said that 14-year-olds were sailing from China "died like a pig?"?"
This idiot didn't realize they were still in the air."
About Ay Janhan from China at the women's final 4x200 m in free style, they said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese took out the ball, kid."
The criticism in Twitter immediately went against Byron McDonald, and many urged him to quit.
Twitter users didn't stop when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradiz, wrote: 'Nothing for himself #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a racist bitch. #disgusted.
Shortly after that, Scott Russell, who had transferred the CBC, apologized in the direct air for MacDonald's comment, saying, 'We apologize for the comment on the landing'.
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened.
The SBS concluded that more than 90 people had apologized for the statement.
A friend of Scott Russell's commented had to apologize to MacDonald
CBC then copied and apologized to over 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
Telesset also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to enter the air.
Yesterday evening we acted quickly to apologize to our viewers in direct air and our subscribers in the neighborhood.
Let's make it clear that the Beyron's comments were related to the speech of the sailor, not to her personality.
And yet it was a inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday, McDonald apologized in a direct effigy and tried to clarify his commentary, claiming that he did not think his words were interpreted as an attack on the personality.
'I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the woman',' he said on the broadcast of the CBC Olympic Games.
'I've been talking about talking to a coward, not about her personally.'
'It is clear to me that there was no disrespect, and I am very sorry.'
Buyer Primark insulted a woman who was unfairly exemplary in the lower white in the middle of the store
The buyers didn't know where to take a look when a woman found out to sample the shirts, on the floor with stores in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she took a look at them, rocked them, and put them back in the crowd.
She continued her search and eventually killed four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkston.
Primark Store Bouverie Place in Folkston, where a woman was wearing tricycles before putting them back on the pole
The mother of the two children Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after the example of the lower white woman, the pregnant woman, had gone out of the store and had bought nothing.
She said, "The people could not believe what they saw."
A hundred in the middle of the store room, she took a couple trousers out of the window, took off her own colognes and trousers and put them on.
"She didn't try to find somewhere else to do it -- she was just standing there unconscious."
"They all got up when she took off her shirts again, and they obviously didn't like her because she put them back on the pole."
She did the same with three other couples before she finally decided that there was nothing that she liked, dressed again and left.
"It doesn't look like she cared about who was watching her, or what she thought of the man who eventually bought those rabbits she's been looking for."
Thirty-three - year - old Jenny Davidson from Kent said, "How is it wrong to think that someone is going to take home the rabbits that someone has already worn, and they haven't been pushed?"
The incident happened on Tuesday.
Davidson added, "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these items from the sale after she left, well and better."
"I don't want to come home with a new pair of women's trousers and find out that the other woman attacked and took them away, and they weren't pushed."
Representative Primark reported: "Prmark knows about the incident that happened in our stock store in Folkston on Tuesday, 9 August."
All the goods concerned were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself From Gun Attacks Using a Cow
The surrounding world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Ron Mizarachi, the master of the Federation of Magi in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance.
Whether they come to you in front or behind, this video will show you how to beat the thief with his own weapons.
If they approach the back, according to Misraki, the first thing you have to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and 'release the line of fire'.
Then you firmly bend the gun between your forehead and your shoulder before you hit them in the face with a free spot.
Then you should bend your knees in the breath, and while the attacker turns away from the pain, you pull the gun out of his hand, beat him in the face, and leave behind the arms on him.
For an armed front, the way to do it is to remove your body from the line of fire, quickly catch the gun, and shake it so that the criminals can't shoot.
At the same time, put the weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then pull the gun out of his pocket before you go back and aim at it.
Does it sound complicated?
Look at the video to see how this is done by Misraki.
But remember, the safest way to get out of any robbery -- if you're not a magician's master, it's to give your money.
For the traveler, Jan Wright uses his language in the dirtiest places in Europe
The British traveler has undergone a severe test of his immune system and of his red reflex, ravaging some of the most filthy and disgusting places in Europe.
The leader and author of the book on travels by Jan Wright, 51, from Suffolk, conducted the euro banknote, the Pearls of Circa Piccadilla, the smile of unity on the train and the Russian public phone to prove the power of his immune system.
Before he looked at every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's going into.
But the experiment, which should become a film called the Guide to the Internal Force, has produced some surprising results.
The idea of licking the garbage button in a train that thousands of others use may be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen closet.
During the entire trip across Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and nurses about the increase of the bacteria and their own health.
Luckily, none of the wounded brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became famous for the tests on the strength of his pillow, traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From public beads in the garage to the unitatase wash button, this task certainly tested its immune system.
In the film he filmed, he said, 'From childhood, I was totally unconcerned about my health, and I put a lot of stuff in the mouth of the earth, eating red and dirty water.'
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused is a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test brain showed the value of a luminometer of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison: only empty hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick, after the value of his luminometer was more than 4,000 units, while just empty hands show less than 60
Wright and the Finnish producer of milk products Valio filmed a film about a traveler called the Guide to the Internal Force, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, for example in the toilet
In a movie, he said, "This is close to one of the worst things I've ever had in the toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to hurt anything, because it's amazing.
The Guide to the Internal Force was withdrawn with the Finnish producer of Valio dairy products.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains acidic bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human bacterium and develop the immune system.
Senior Vice President Valio on snacks, juices and new categories said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended up with the idea of "don't call Jan."
They claim that interest in the health of the mine is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the health of the bladder and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in the health of the pocket is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we have been able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Haqala, who was the film director, added, 'Let's say I'd lose respect for Jan if he did some of the things I asked for, for example, a disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.'
Of course, some things made Jan easier, and some were rather harsh.
I'm glad some of these scars made us fall in jail.
During a survey conducted in 2015 in Valio, 84 per cent of respondents linked oxygen to only the good condition of the stomach and bladder, and 58 per cent said that they used at least sometimes the products containing added oxygen bacteria.
The Hooligan family destroyed Saltash, the municipal house of Cornwall, before eviction
The huligans left their municipal home with a loss of £ 50,000 after they had been evicted for intimidation from their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilkoka, were expelled from their real estate facility in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they had been forced out of the real estate facility, shocked housing cooperatives found the real estate in a condition that required repair.
The walls were left with visible holes, the half-holes were exposed, the trash was scattered over the floor, and the walls were scratched.
The family is now relocated and is expected to live in a private apartment
Donna Macevoy, a exile in Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid not to save him.
She said, 'This was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live that way.
There are many things that need to be weighed, because this property will probably be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family enjoys foolish glory and its name enjoys foolish glory.
Couples of three sons who have lived in the real estate since time, and the police report that the reign of terror caused by the family has included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of the inhabitants of neighboring areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screaming, disputes and abuse.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June.
In a few rooms of the house, which can be slept, there was an old garbage
The sex boards in the house where drugs were sold in the past were exhausted
Neighbors say they saw the dragons on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after they had been granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The eviction was facilitated by neighbors who said that their lives were turned into real hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care."
We lived with them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we saw the police here is amazing.
'We couldn't sleep this morning.'
We stood up because it was so quiet - we didn't get used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the head of the Cornwall Housing Neighbourhood Group, said that the family could not cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in a house for 20 years, with the police, and regularly called the police
Musore and old toys were flung down on the affected side of the municipal house
He added: 'This is the view that the tenant could not accept any responsibility for the conduct of her and her family, since eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very difficult case, since the conduct was limited, and their actions must have been horrendous to her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done to give us information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to neighbors and will signal that social behaviour will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but he said that they all had a little more than 20.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the burned houses after eviction
Residents will now have to remove the dust that surrounds the house
In 2014, the police had arranged a search in the house and found more than 70 g of rope, as well as weights, corresponding items and £ 1700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after he recognized himself guilty of possession of Class B drugs for the purpose of delivery.
She stated that the money had been paid for the funeral for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partner are now living in the Plimote.
The walls of many of the houses were dug out of scratches all over the surface.
Police say they will try to expel tenants who are not subject to the rental rules of the premises
Angela Crou, of the Devon and Cornwall police, stated that the eviction had sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
"This is a message for those who feel that they can do without the blame of the accuser, and those who harm such conduct," she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be allowed by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when a low - flying military aircraft barely hit the beach
In the city of Aveiro, Portugal, tourists who adored the sunset were terrified of their lives
P-3C Orion Air Force aircraft Portugal flew incredibly low
Air Force reported that it had conducted a training flight but insisted on lack of security risk
That's the moment when scared tourists start panicking, while the moment the low - flying plane was hovering over the crowded beach.
A military aircraft in dramatic frames was seen flying off the sand catch zone in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The restoratives jumped on their feet as soon as they became understandablely concerned by the noise of the aircraft’s engines, but they could not see what was moving in their direction through the cloud.
The incident happened last night not far from the city of Aviru in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandez, one of the few respirators who published a video of a shocking spring in social networks, said, "He flew very low twice, and there was a moment when it showed that he was going to break up."
Nuno Arrogah added, "I've been working on the surf and I swear it was such a feeling that the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the Aveiro beach were terrified when the plane showed up from the fog and flew to an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the P-3C Orion aircraft had operated a training flight to find fishing vessels at the shore, and had to relax so low as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot said that the plane flew a little lower than usual due to the lack of visibility caused by the smoke from nearby hot forests, but the air force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged the native part of Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today made a statement that the pilot had to fly so low because of circumstances such as dense fog and the power of forest fires that had deteriorated visibility
The aircraft operated a training flight and the pilot was ordered to find fishing boats within the scope of the mission
The HASSP system has been mandatory for interview for more than a year, but most of the cafes and restaurants in Petersburg have not yet introduced it.
Checks are becoming more active, and the business is threatened with fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, Russian version of HASSP) system is an analysis of risks and critical control points for food manufacturers and carriers, as well as companies in the field of housing in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (TS).
Business checks carried out by Rossumnavir in Petersburg began in February 2015.
However, officials have only paid fines for individual violations of the regulation (see "Concerning documents" ...).
In general, the non-implementation of the regulation will result in an enterprise of 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HASSP was designed in the 1960s as a system that takes into account the risks associated with and preventing food products.
Then it was about food security for astronauts.
The system is now being used in all food businesses not only in the United States but also in Canada and the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASSP has been operating in the territory of TC.
The development and implementation of the business system was 4 years (the need for HICPs appeared in the TS regulation in 2011).
However, entrepreneurs themselves and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of this rule.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the rule applies only to food products, not to restaurants, - explained the head of the General Council of Elena Certele.
Now they're all trying to get lost.
The expected period for the renewal of charter voyages to Turkey, at the end of August, began in September.
But they won't challenge the ambitious demand, because their target audience -- family with children -- is already preparing for school, experts say.
Yesterday, the Alliance of Tourist Agencies sent a letter to the Government asking the charters to be approved.
“For many Russian tourists, the question of the selection of quality and accessible sea rest is unsolved, as most accommodation facilities are already banned in Krasnodar County and Crimea resorts before the end of September”, notes the authors and stresses that the opening of charter transport in August does not significantly affect the already existing demand for Russian sea tourism.
As reported in the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Union of Tourism (RST), if Russian and Turkish aviation authorities are quickly agreed upon, the renewal of charter transfers to Turkey can be expected for a month.
A clear understanding, when the charters are renewed, depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, aircraft can fly in September, even in August, if the tour operators quickly implement the programmes and agree with the airlines on board," said Pavel Rumiancev, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Bureau of the RTD.
According to him, the resumption of the charters is good news, but does not have an excessive impact on the market, because the main buyers of charter tubes - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or vacation in other countries.
In the summer season, tours are bought mainly by lonely travelers and couples.
Charter programmes can be expected for those who have the opportunity to relax spontaneously," said Pavel Romaniansev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists, if it now offers a lot of budget proposals -- 50-60,000 rubles for two tours, because there are people who are looking forward to a very cheap tour," says Valeria Rosental, Director General of Optio-Travel.
In another case, it is certainly not worth the expense - the main mass of travel is already planned.
Pavel Romancev also believes that since there is a demand for regular trips to Turkey, the charters will also be demanded, but the wait is not worth the wait.
"For Turkey, the launch of charters is now a repetition of the next season," says Pavel Rumiancev.
"The opening of charters in Turkey is a positive news for the next season," says Valeria Rubzova.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from NDFL provided by law from compensation payments within the limits of approved rules relating to compensation for damage caused by injury or other damage to health.
Extradition of workers employed in work with harmful working conditions is provided for by the prescribed rules of Art. 222 TC RF.
The same rules and conditions for extradition are laid down by the Order of the Russian Minhravos Development dated 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, the free issue of milk or other equivalent foodstuffs is made to workers on days of actual employment in work with harmful working conditions due to harmful production factors at work.
On the basis of those standards, the Russian FNSF concluded in the letter in question that, in accordance with paragraph 2 (3), 217 FC RFs were exempt from the NDF's income as a value of milk delivered to workers on days of actual employment in work with harmful working conditions in accordance with the Standards and conditions approved by the Order of the Ministry of Development of Russia dated 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
The Moscow Gastrowbank has been unlicensed by the CB.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrew a licence for bank operations to the credit organization of the Shareholders Commercial Bank "GAZSTROIBANK" registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, GAZSTROIBANK AKB conducted a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of cash in low-quality assets.
Adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a credible reflection of the value of the bank's assets led to the establishment of a credit institution for the implementation of bankruptcy prevention measures.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in suspicious transit operations.
In the bank, a temporary administration has been appointed until the date of appointment in a competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization have been suspended under federal laws.
AKB GAZROIBANK is a participant in the investment insurance system.
I would remind you that the payment of insurance compensation to bank investors, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal Law No. 177-FZ "Concerning the contributions of individuals to the banks of the Russian Federation " provides for a 100% balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million dollars in total per investor.
Payments, according to the Contribution Insurance Agency, will start no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the report, on 1 August 2016, the assets of AKB GAZROIBANK had 335 seats in the RF banking system.
London School, which joined IGIL, was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultan, one of three British schoolchildren who left London last year to join the IGIL, it is reported that they died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akunji said her family knew about her death in Rake, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She was supposed to have died of a Russian air strike in Rake, a gang gang in the country, as ITV News reported Thursday.
Sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just once when she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"We can only hope that the only advantage of this is that it is a funeral and dedication to others, that it is the risks involved in a military action zone, to convince people to make the same choice at any time," Akundji said.
In February 2015 Sultan and two other schoolchildren from eastern London settled on a plane in Turkey and then on a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan family said that she had married an IGIL fighter in Syria and had been widowed for several months.
Reed claims that Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Judge in the event of election
The leader of the Democrats in Senator Harry Reid said he was convinced that a democratic candidate in President Hillary Clinton would appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected as President.
The Republicans blocked Garland's claim, and President Barack Obama nominated it in March.
The leader of the majority of the group in the Mitch McConnell senate said that the next president would elect the person who could replace the last judge of the Supreme Court, Antonina Skalia.
Reed said on Thursday's conference call that he predicted Clinton would choose Garland "with some confidence."
Representative Reed later said he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether she was going to bring Garland up and just make assumptions.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team wouldn't want to skip a boat with a new choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeal in the province of Colombia.
Reed said that the Republicans that block Garland's nomination were "acceptable" and "representatives" of the Republican candidate in President Donald Trump.
He said that Trump wasn't fit for office.
Treats states that erotic calendars for 'women as well as for men'
The Journal of Treatments collaborates with photographer David Bellmer to release the 2017 calendar, inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of popular celebrities, they aim to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with popular museums.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a large number of modeled models differs from old-fashioned Playboys, because Playboy is for men.
I'm doing it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar too.
“We need to return to the exhibition of an eternal and classically decorated figure, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the woman’s body,” said Shaw in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project, because it is a beautiful art.
Models can be photographed online or personally on open-ended posters in Los Angeles and New York.
They're going to give Moscow memories of unscrupulous Internet stores.
In Moscow, they are going to release a memo that will tell us how not to become a victim of the Internet store.
That's what they've been told in Rosprupnaszor, says M24.
It is reported that the experts of the institutions are preparing a memory that will help citizens properly select online stores and identify possible fraud schemes.
The concept of this brochure provides several sections.
These will be general information and legislative frameworks, rules for the delivery of goods, ways of protecting their legal rights.
The annex will provide recommendations on how to make the claim correctly and so on," said Roszupnadzor.
The memory is being developed so far.
It will then be located on the Roszuznazor site in Moscow, also planned to release a printed version and distribute it to the Moscows.
Mid-Russia issued a statement calling the name of the second suspect in the organization of the conflict in Crimea.
Persons from Ukraine and Russia have been detained, assisting in the preparation of terrorist acts.
Among them is Mr. Eugene Alexandrovich and Mr. Andrei Romanovic.
“All of them give a good witness,” says the report.
A former resident of the Zaporozh area of Evgenie Panov, who was detained on suspicion in the organization of the crime scene in Crimea, confessed his guilt for questioning.
FAS costs Google 438 million rubles.
The Russian Federal Anti-Money Service (FAS) has appointed an administrative fine for the Google Corporation of 438 million dollars, says the department's website.
"The fine for Google's violation of anti-monopoly legislation was 438 million rubs.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the fine in the near future," said FAS Deputy Manager Alexei Docenko.
During the investigation, FAS found that Google provides smartphone manufacturers sold in Russia, the Google Play app shop only provided that other corporate apps will be installed on the device.
These annexes include a search system that should be located on the main smartphone screen.
Thus, the corporation violates article 10 of the “Protection of Competition” (use of dominant position).
We are confident that compliance with the prescription will provide an opportunity for competition in the Russian mobile market, which will benefit our consumers.
The Competition Protection Act must be respected by all companies whose products are placed on the territory of the Russian Federation and by transnational corporations, including," noted the Head of the Office of Communications and Information Technology Management of the FAS of Russia Elena Zaeva.
The government suspects 16 Russian shops.
The New Book Network was charged with selling the book "50 days before my suicide."
The "New Book" Web Store for the sale of the book Stace Kramer "50 days before my suicide," reports the Moscow City News Agency.
As reported in Rosproznastra, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be seen as “promoting or motivating the suicide of children and adolescents”.
The District Court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the dissemination of information products to children and decided to impose a fine in the form of a fine with the confiscation of 49 copies of the printed product arrested by the Roszupnadzer administration.
The source in the New Book confirmed that it was Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that Moscow's largest bookstores were being screened for the book "50 days before my suicide".
In Moscow, the night will come to the memory of Ernst the Unknown.
In Moscow, the memory of the sculptor Ernst Unknown will be spent the night, says the TASS.
The event will take place on 15 August at the Central Literature House.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown in the United States personally.
It was therefore decided to set up this evening for those who want to mention it on their homeland," said the Russian Jewish Congress press.
There they noted that it was important for the widow of Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
In the evening, close friends of the Unknown, including Evgenie Eutushenko poet, artist Boris Messerer, President of the GMI, Puškina Irina Antonov, director Mark Rozovski, as well as Minister of Culture of Russia Vladimir Medinski, Head of Department of Culture of Moscow Aleksandr Kibovski, Deputy Mayor of Moscow Leonid Pečnikovi, were invited.
It was previously reported that the family of Ernst the Unknown planned to carry out a panioid on a sculptor in New York, allegedly by 14 August.
The final consumer was guilty: Who really buys plastics?
A single middle-aged man likes guilt.
And as long as you have not been allowed to interfere with the commentaries with gross insults under the pseudonym of NeAllOdiniki Men's MiddleLett, this claim is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, so much of the discussion about the restoration of the plates is due, not to the boom of the generation of two thousand who want to penetrate the new material, but to the nostalgia of the middle years.
Those who have recently purchased a wine album c most of the probability are 45 to 54, according to data.
Moreover, those of the 18-24 age group are the least likely.
This is also not simply a loving act of gathering: older buyers are more likely to have feelings of loneliness (56 per cent versus 53 per cent) and 69 per cent against 66 per cent.
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me while I was going to the center of Soho's relived street, in a modest gray suit, and vengefully vesiculating before the stop, laying hands and saying something exciting, "Yes, let's see."
Yeah, let's see.
While Soho’s heart is slowly losing its charm and grace — hotels, cafes, paperchase shoppers have now filled the buildings once occupied by independent sellers — several musical shops with fantastic specialists have remained.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next stage, where I'm close to different people in some of these stores and try to assess their age and emotional mood by monitoring.
Glasgo Stuart, 55 years old, whom I walked from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably over 20 years old), in London on a noon date to meet, and walk through shops to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I'm asking?
"I think so," he says.
I've got about 3,000 or 4,000 plastics.
These pictures, shown above (he sent me by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), go through the walls of his guest.
His reason for acquiring such a huge number of albums and singles is partly due to his income: he can now buy plates that he could not afford only when they left, and buy the items he sold when he was young and on the mill.
"Many of what I'm buying is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things for which I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plastics are probably introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
It's my fault.
Wes, 25 years old who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets are in line with the YouTube profile.
He noted, however, the new concern of the people who were affected by the noise in the media, the people who heard of the return and were obliged to buy their old plates.
According to the conversations I had, people were released from their collection, usually in 1998 or 1999.
Clients who once sold their own guilt to buy a compact disc now sell their compact discs to buy their plastics," he says.
This may explain the damage caused by a certain age of rebirth.
What about the supposed emotional importance of plastics?
It's enough to spend a few seconds in a store, such as Phoenix, to understand that plastic stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wesa, some of the senior clients, in particular, have been insulted by an insolvent payment system.
Some wine lovers may feel a shock from the digital world and prefer to be removed permanently by known plastic converts, items that arouse memories of unmistakable youth.
"I think that sometimes it can be a filling of waste or a possession of material things as a kind of relief," Wez says.
Because I'm a collector, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it.
It's just a way to take your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the plastic locker.
The ICM survey in April showed that almost 50 per cent of the people who bought the wine album last month had not yet heard it.
The survey also found that 41 per cent had a player they never used, while 7 per cent had no plastic player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably look seriously downcast, glamorous with Bosano's collectors.
The "Trofheine" aspect of the rebirth is what Johnny, 42 years old, has observed in the Sounds of the Universe (estimated by three middle-aged men).
"Someone came up recently and said, "I don't have a plastic player, but I want to buy a radiohead, so we can put it to ourselves," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
It's more of a piece, less of music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a plastic player."
They're younger, they're older, they're a little less than twenty, they'll only know about it.
Fopp, who's now taking almost the whole floor of the wine, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples with 70, who take pictures, boys and women of middle age.
Although the atmosphere is less unencumbered than in the above-mentioned shops, the latest Synth and Sex Pop Wild Beast, rather than the jazz improvisation, is being penetrated through the columns, it is pleasant to see the variety of customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it's hard to find a painful psychological trauma that's been around for 30 seconds.
Eleonora, 27 years old, walked on the Fop for a few minutes, considering the different plates available for sale.
She's looking at the goods, not the money.
She didn't earn much, she said, so she didn't collect the plates very well.
It's worth it.
Listening to music on a computer or another device is simple, but the beauty of the wine is ..." - it's wrapped in dreams with a breath filled with love.
I don't know how to explain it. It's really unrepeatable.
My last stop is a shop, which, as they say, has contributed to the emergence of a new generation of lovers, guilty: City fashions.
While I'm making an illusion that I'm looking at gins-based shorts, I'm looking at a bunch of foster girls, every minute of the Polaroid cameras, before the father and his daughter start discussing the buyer's purchase of Crosley.
On the left is a ladder with a wall of Adel, Jeffa Bakli, Amy Waynehaus and Flitwood Mac: a mixture of modern style and classics, binding plates for any medium-sized collection.
No one sees — perhaps because they are mere decorations, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's the current "Goddess guilt."
However, given that any attracting attention to these items could mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the depth of Soho for a while, almost nothing to complain about.
It is not surprising that a population with more than most of the time and money than most of the world's population is the one that spends most of the money on luxury items, such as wine.
But as far as my findings show that the results of YouGov are accurate, at least in Soho plastic shops, they do not rule out the existence of a huge number of women collectors and lovers of guilt that exist in reality, in plastic shops and online forums.
These people are probably working at school or in offices.
But obviously they don't do it on Thursday morning, walking through the shops of plastics on Bervik Street, pasting plastics, and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old false leader who writes on the shoulders of no-suspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland’s polar shark — the longest - live ringed animal — video recording
Scientists claim that Greenland’s polar shark has the largest life span of all the world’s bells.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, states that the record has placed a female age from 272 to 512 and a length of five metres.
The French court rejects the proposal to drop the shop in the Jungle refugee camp
The French court rejected the offer of the Kale authorities to remove dozens of individual shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At the trial hearing this week, the Kale authorities said that the State should be able to dispose of a total of 72 individual shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer 50 cents of tea or simple meals for several euros in private restaurants.
Prefecture Kale said that these places should be removed because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they are at risk of fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vitally necessary, stating that free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups do not provide sufficient food for the growing number of food in the camp.
They said that private shops and restaurants often provide blood and free food to those in need.
The Lila Court ruled that there was no legitimate reason to drive out the people who managed 72 individual shops, but stated that the problems of Cala Prefecture were “fully understood”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that bakalai, coffee and restaurants played a lot more than just feeding people who "live under extreme conditions."
He said that space provided peaceful points of meeting of refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk was the children ' s coffee book Jungley at the camp, which worked for no benefit and offered 200 lunches a day, English and French courses and consultations on the provision of shelter for hundreds of vulnerable minors without escorting to the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect children’s coffee.
The letter sent to the Guardian stated that its closure would "be a disaster for these children, some of whom are not over eight years old".
Two charity agencies, Aid to Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number in the Jungle camp had increased and exceeded 9,000 people — the highest in all history — after a sharp increase in the number of new arrivals in the summer.
The libraries of the microregions invite young liberators to know-how programs.
This week, the branch library will hold meetings on the Day of the City, the Year of Russian Film and even the Day of Physicist.
The programmes are based on a child audience, so most of them will be in play form.
Today, on August 10th, the library- branch No. 2, in the island microzone, invites the cross-presentation "My Little Town".

Britain stays on silver in Regbi-7 after Fiji master class allows them to take gold
The impressive series of Britain in Regbi-7 was disrupted by the Fiji team in the finals on Thursday evening, when they were completely smashed 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class on the possession of the ball, the distribution, the removals, the support of the game, the running of the lines and the rough force to win the gold — their first Olympic medal of any colour.
The defeat was not too poor in the form of a silver - third in Britain per day - and they could be proud of their efforts at the first Regby-7 Olympic tournament, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on their way.
The painful slaughter of Boxes, 7-5 in the semifinal before the same day, could be returned to negatively affect them in the final.
But, no matter what, Fiji won as much as a 15-person team.
This may be some comfort for Britain — but probably not — that at least one Britishman will hang on a gold medal’s neck tomorrow: Chief Coach Fiji-Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.
It was some kind of trip for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.
This is where they lost only one.
These strikes will cause pain, but progress is disastrous.
Fiji began to be beautiful, for the sake of fun, refusing to take over the British ball.
It was like moving on a bus column for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Collinsau dived into the corner.
The name four minutes per hour, Jerry Tuwey, added another touchdown on the right flag, which was realized.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great attempt to capture Mitchell kept Leon Nakarov from killing a third, but that only kept Fiji.
At the seventh minute, Jasa Veremaloua made a right-hand score, and Britain played 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after the resume and there were still more minutes... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravo then broke through a few more major attempts to capture Britain, and the storm took a line to get a doll.
Implementation led to 29-0 breaks.
It seemed as if Fiji were born for the game in Regbi-7, while Britain still has a hand in hand.
Which is much the same.
The UK has done mass replacements for half-games, and they have charged the Fijian Dam... for all four minutes, that the first half standards were good until Joshua Tuisov passed after several brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton took a shot at Britain, made a left-hand tanker so that the account would be 36-7, but the game had long been on the way to the South Sea islanders whose fans were singing, waving their flags and dancing in the courts.
It was impossible not to admire the full joy of Fiji's approach.
Matta William decorated a Fijian cake that didn't need to be decorated, another attempt in the last few seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians wrapped up, and Britain fell on the lawn, totally victorious.
Earlier that same day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in its semifinal, and Britain slightly moved South Africa into a strained semifinal one attempt for each one, the British implementation.
Kyle Brown pulls the Boxes off in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great work, broke his leg and hit the beams in the second half.
The shining last attempt by Marcus Watson, a 15th brother on the side of the English team, Anthony, to win — and finally a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning were inspired to win a hard fight for cancer coaches.
It won't be any more important gold in these games, and that's what it says.
From the first movement to the last, 220 major achievements in history, Helen Glover and Hezer Stanning found their added value in the golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who wore the belts, there were three votes in this boat, coach Robin Williams echoed while they were always striving for the second round of the Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in British sports annals that reached such an altitude.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th unconfirmed statement, again unprecedented.
What we see is that two brilliant sportsmen rolling on the surface with the elegance of the leeds do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
For every gold battalion, hands are ready to help gradually growing victories that are important, and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live before seeing this day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had a urticaria cancer, which is one of the things they can operate, and they did it.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
She's kind of changing your way to the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was lucky that he could start treatment early in 2014 in the intersessional season, keeping the schedule at a minimum, if this could be a correct expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed a paycheck, so I needed to fix it quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital, and I was walking in the office — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet, although they had spoken enough steps.
That's how it starts.
The handle itself is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
In the next moment after their victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own feelings.
Stanning, the captain of the Artillerian team with the service in Afghanistan behind their shoulders, said, "I was emotionally broken this week, maybe it's a little cross, but it means so much."
It just confirms how much that means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin, too.
These were fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be no one, so thanks to him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I could not ask for a better training partner or a better trainer.
Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning didn't lose any race in five years.
This couple has a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even at the last 500 metres when the New Zealand and Denmark teams began approaching, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We've been in a lot of trouble.
Helen called, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
Now it's very important not to get in.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we didn't try to do something amazing.
We didn't expect firefighters today, we just waited for us to be able to do well and get out and win this race, which we did.
A couple will need a year to decide their future.
The floor needs to be at the wedding next month, on her own with the TV viewer of Steve Backshawl's adventures.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
The Government has extended the period for the destruction of sanctions products
The Government extended until the end of 2017 the period for the destruction of food prohibited from entering Russia.
The decision was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, which was published on the official legal portal.
The embargo was introduced in our country in August 2014.
The ban was subsequently extended several times and is now in force until 31 December 2017.
Russia is prohibited from importing certain agricultural products, commodities and food from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, marine products, vegetables, fruit and milk products were prohibited.
The use of food imported into the country around the embargo has been taking place in Russia since August 2015.
Only for the 1st quarter of 2016, about 100 tonnes of prohibited products were removed.
The desire for "ban"
On Friday, rain and hail are expected in Moscow.
The city area will be surrounded by an atmospheric front that will bring precipitation and lower the air temperature.
During the day, the air goes up to 25 degrees hot.
Yes, on Saturday night in Moscow places will be a short-term rain, possible storms and wind breaks up to 15 m/s.
The day is expected to rain with storms and wind breaks up to 12-17 m/s.
The rains are also forecasted in the Orlov, Kursk and Vronez areas, reported by Dni.ru.
The next working week is unlikely.
The WTO panel of arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the organization ' s rules.
Import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia upon accession to WTO.
"This is the first case where WTO has taken a decision against the RF," says the statement on the official website of the organization.
However, the referees stressed in their conclusion that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia ' s measures were "systematic" or "complete".
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt the import duties on paper and refrigerators soon.
This is reflected in the communication from the Ministry of Development of Russia.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to appeal to the World Trade Organization for Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the conduct of the United States in dealing with WTO disputes undermines the principles of discussion.
Such a statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members because of the refusal of Americans to approve for the second time by South Korean judge Chan Son Hwa.
Therefore, Russia will not address the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against the FP.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It is now made up of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
In the administration of the President, the manager changed
Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed the head of his own administration, former Deputy Sergei Ivan Ivan Wyno.
Vladimir Putin made transfers to the President ' s administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Wayne said at the meeting that he considered the important anti-corruption work that had begun to be the head of President Ivanov's administration and promised to cooperate with the Government.
Previously, the "Reports" said that experts considered Sergei Ivanov's resignation as the head of the administration to be transparent and understandable, and the translation would not change anything in principle in the work of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the leader who worked in the President ' s administration for a long time has effectively conducted the work of the AP.
Instead, the Deputy Chief of Administration, Anton Wyno, was a man who was well aware of the specific nature of this work.
Poland is allowed not to buy fuel from Gasprom.
The Polish State oil company PGNIG does not rule out that in a few years' time, gas supplies from the RF may become unattractive because of the re-orientation of fuel from Norway and other countries.
The Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company, Boguslav Mažez, reported.
His word is TASS.
"It may happen that we will not buy gas at all (in Gasprom), we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main supply lines will become the East, the raw materials of the SPG terminals and Norway," Majezz said.
Gasprom is currently dominant in gas supplies in Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that in the first half of 2016, the Russian supplier placed almost 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas, which is 30% higher in 2015.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG purchases increased to 49.8% compared to 40% earlier.
It is recalled that on 22 July, the Polish Anti-monopoly Authority did not agree to the establishment of a joint venture for Gasproma and its European partners for the construction of the North Stream-2 gas pipeline.
During that month, Poland had left a request for Gasprom to supply 11 billion cubic metres of gas to North Stream-2.
The Vice-President of the Dutch Government, Alexander Medvedev, said so.
The "North Stream-2" auction will be held in 2017 and the auction will be scheduled in autumn 2016 on its site.
At the end of May it was reported that Gazprom had not yet planned to take any action in connection with the Polish party's intention to refuse long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, a Vice-President of the administration of Alexander Medvedev said.
He recalled that in the 1st quarter of this year, the Polish had only increased by 42 per cent of the RF gas purchases.
Zapred Gazproma added that the fact that the Polish PGNIG had made a statement to the Stockholm arbitral tribunal did not yet mean that the negotiations would be terminated.
The Polish company had previously appealed to the court to reduce the purchase price for Russian gas.
It was recalled that the authorized Government of Poland on gas and energy infrastructure Petri Naimsky reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to extend the gas supply contract with Gasprom.
Poland's contract with Gasprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the authorized Government of Poland on gas and energy infrastructure, Petri Naimsky, stated that his country could be denied supply of blue fuel from the east six years later.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will unite the country with the Norwegian Shelf.
“North Stream-2” provides for the construction of two marine gas pipelines of a total capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Russia to the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMI) has increased the number of observers around the border of Ukraine with Crimea.
This was reported by the first SMS in Ukraine by Alexander Hugh.
"I can confirm that the IMF has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, responding to the journalist's relevant question, "RIA News".
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is peaceful, there is no record of incidents affecting security.
Observers tracked the three crossing points across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
There was a video on the ground at the airport of Oufa of the Jak-42 passenger plane, which moved outside the flight-land area 400 m and landed on the left wing.
The video's been published by the 360-phone.
The CPC occurred at 4.30 a.m. in Moscow time.
Crassavia's flight arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place where there were no casualties.
Only the aircraft was transported to the station.
Oufa Airport is operating in a normal way.
The Freight Investigation Office for the Transport of the CDF was responsible for identifying the reason for the severe landing of the liner aircraft.
UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in the occupied areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Stefan de Mistura, considers the fact that the incident was undisputed.
Such statements were made before the third round of inter-Syrian negotiations, which should begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists began investigating reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information on the use of toxic gas, allegedly chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
The opposition then stated that in an area where the Russian military-transport helicopter had been hit recently, the aircraft had dropped bombs with a poisonous substance, but in Moscow these charges were called in.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defence accused the opposition group Harrakat Nur ad-Din az-Zinky.
Soon it became known that the two bombs started with toxic gas.
That's confirmed by the BBC one of the victims.
"Just a few minutes later, I felt the smell of the gas, the burning of the eyes, it became difficult to breathe," he quoted the audience as saying.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of the poison gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be assessed as a war crime.
The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters: "The evidence that this really happened is a lot."
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is contained in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC).
Although all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015, human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of chlorine by the Syrian army against “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo makes it difficult for the shootings of its areas to take place daily and terrorists prevent the city from getting out of the city.
As Reuters reports, the UN is awaiting a “humanitarian break” from Russia in military action.
The current system of daily three-hour silence in the organization is considered to be “adequate enough to help nearly 2 million civilians who have been hunted”.
Counsellor Staffhan de Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Jan Egelan, said that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required for the delivery and evacuation of the sick and injured from there every week.
"We have to send abundant cargo from a colonized truck to a place where the roads are almost destroyed and what remains is gone," said Mr. Egelan. "But the Russian delegation confirmed the readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table."
Consultations in Geneva between representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian break” continue.
How Russia opened "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
Russia announced on 11 August, in the context of the ongoing battle against Aleppo, that a three-hour cease-fire regime would be in place every day starting on Thursday.
The creation of "humanitarian windows" is intended to ensure conditions for delivery to the city of medicine, food and items of the first need.
The decision of the Ministry of Defence was taken in the light of the increasing international pressure on Moscow, with a call for military action and a call for the resumption of the negotiation process.
Four people were killed as a result of a series of explosions in Thailand's resorts.
A few explosions immediately set off in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people were killed as a result of the attack, 19 were wounded.
The epicenter of explosions came to the city of Hua-Hin.
Ten foreigners were among the victims, and there were no Russians among the four States.
The responsibility for the incident had not yet taken up any of the terrorist groups, but the IMF had hastened to declare that Islamists had not participated in it.
Several people have already been detained, suspected of explosions.
According to preliminary data from the local police, the extent and specificity of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the warlords.
The attacks took place in popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the Phuketa area and the city of Hua-Hin, Trang and Surat-Tani.
Following the arrival of a military junta in the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few sectors that demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, with 1.5 million more in 2015.
The first suspects were already detained in the preparation and organization of the attacks, police officer Krisan Patanacharoen reported.
While speaking early on about the goal, he added, however, in the IMF, “it is certain that they are not related to international extremist groups”.
It was too early to make any conclusions, Mr. Patanacharoen said.
But we certainly know that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact it is a local diversion, and we are trying to identify the personalities of those behind them.
The explosions took place on the day of the birth of Queen Tilanda Sikrit.
The Thai hunta believes that the protection of the monarchy is one of its main priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to the statement by the police general, the bombs were blown off at a distance of half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on the lively streets filled with dining in the restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four dead became a Thai girl who was trading in street food.
The identity of the remaining victims is unknown, but they are known to be residents of four foreign States.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them four German citizens, three Dutch nationals, two Italians and Austrian citizens.
There are no Russians among the victims of the explosions, reported the Rosturism press.
Local experts also linked the explosions to the last referendum on 7 August, with 61.4% of the country ' s population supporting the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by the Commission for the Development of a Constitution appointed by the military force.
It was necessary to determine whether they supported the system in which the Supreme House of Parliament was fully appointed as military and had a significant role in the election of the Prime Minister of the country.
The new system has been adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Remember, on 22 May 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the commander of the Prussian Chan-Och army.
At this point, he said, the army had raised the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in the negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military set up the National Council of Peace and Order, introduced the commandal time and censorship, sparked the protesting and high-level House of Parliament.
How Bangkok turned out to be an emergency
The Government of Thailand, headed by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat in January 2014, announced the introduction of an emergency situation in Bangkok and the capital of the provinces.
The special regime extended for 60 days.
As in Bangkok, there were two explosions.
In January 2014, two explosions took place in the centre of Bangkok at the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests took place, resulting in 28 people being affected, five of them being in critical condition.
The explosions were made by unknown motorcycles.
The authorities stepped up security in the capital and drew military forces to protect demonstrators.
In the Sukh Loge, conditions began to develop.
As “U” became known, the Government was invited to agree on the draft terms of the auction for the gold-plated location of Sukha Log with the maintenance of two key constraints.
The auction is proposed not to allow companies with 25 per cent or more of foreigners and applicants with a minimum attendance of 25 per cent.
The industry does not expect the Government to prescribe conditions, noting that many players are not at risk of taking a difficult and expensive project.
The auctions can be announced in August and held in October.
Minorities have submitted to the Government a draft order and conditions of auction for the largest undeveloped gold settlement in Russia Suhay Lodge (Irkutsk area, stock and resources of 130 million U.S.), two sources of U, known as the situation.
The project has been introduced on Wednesday evening, one of them will be clarified.
The project has been introduced to the Government by U.S.M.
A representative of the facilitating vice-premier Alexander Cloponina said "U", that the project had not yet been implemented in the office of officer.
"The auction may be announced already in August, immediately after the Government's order has been issued, and, taking into account the time limit for the collection of requests by potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender may be held already in October," they say in Minprida.
According to “U”, the project maintained two key requirements for potential participants in the option that was sent to reconciliation to ministries and FIIVAs in July (it is for “U”).
The first is the presence in the applicant's capital of at least 25% of the attendance.
Second, the refusal to have access to auctions for foreign investors was based on the FZ-57 understanding of inno-investments in strategic societies.
According to the two FZ articles, as already written "U" on 2 August, companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent and above) are neither tax residents of the FF nor have dual nationality may not be admitted to the auction.
The Government has the power to impose such restrictions, since the Sukha Log relates to federal fraud (saves of more than 50 tons of gold).
The project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies”, but refused to comment on the details before the Government.
The call for participation in the capital of the auction was launched by the Irkutsk Region, spoke "U" in Munich in December 2015 and later confirmed the governor of the region Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to Munich by his predecessor Sergey Eroshenko, "I had an investment agreement with Rosteh".
Those who lobbyed the restrictions on the admission of foreigners do not specify the "U" members.
"But it's in the spirit of time: not to give control to the biggest gold settlement in Russia in the face of Western sanctions," says the interviewer "U" known for the preparation of the auction.
The Head of the Municipality of Sergei Donski stated on 1 August that foreigners “can go to the consortium” if the applicants attract them “as a financial structure, technological partners”.
The U.S. spokespersons considered it unlikely that conditions would be adjusted in the Government.
The main claimant at Sukha Log in the industry is the consortium of the largest producer of RF PAO "Polish", the subsidiary son of Suleiman Kerimova Saydu, and Rosteh.
As wrote by U, in July the partners created the S.P.L. Gold, where the P.L. had 51% share in the R.T.R.R.R. structure - 49%.
In Rostehhe, the comments were rejected, in Poluse they declared "U", that "no doubt interested in this asset" and had all the necessary competences and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be adopted after the announcement of the conditions," they added to "Polish".
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision of the RF Government has been called "U".
The Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, a developer of assets in Čukotke, said that they could participate in the development of the Dry Log, whereas Polymetal and Nordgold, according to the U, were not interested in the asset.
The head of the Union of Gold Industry RF Sergei Kashuba assessed U's investment in Suhay Log in December 2015 at $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential claimants are not only afraid of the volume of investment, but also of the complexity of the project: there is a need for a serious experience of stockpiles and working technology with complex mines, explained by the "U" interlocutors in the industry.
In the pension market, the largest M&A - “CIT Finance Pension Administrator” started the merger process of four NPFs.
As a result, NPF will be established on the basis of the Gazfund Pension Stockpiles of approximately 373 billion rubles.
On the start of the merger procedure of the four pension funds: “KIT Finance”, “Promogrofund”, “Inheritance” and “Gazfund Pension Stocks” yesterday, the owner of 100% of the OBO funds reported “KIT Finance Pension Administrator”.
“Reorganization is carried out in agreement with the CB in compliance with the requirement that the terms of the existing treaties be not undermined”, the company said in its communication.
The association is run on the Gazfund Pension Stockpiles.
As NPF Director Oleg Whiteback notes, the pooling of funds has a number of challenges: increasing the geography of the presence, concentration of resources for development, reducing costs, diversifying the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
According to him, the reference period for the completion of consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of NPF Gazfund Pension Stockpiles, it will become the largest player on the ODP market.
As of 31 March, the amount of pensionable stocks of the pooled funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As reported on the fund website, the beneficiaries of the fund ' s owner ' s “CIT Finance Pension Administrator” are now Anatoly Gavrileenko (the Gazfund sub-controlled OAS holds 65 per cent) and NPF (35%).
However, the only association of the group started much later on.
So, the O1 NPF Sub-Control Group, the Future, swallowed Stalfund early this year.
Currently, this combined NFP is joining the Uralsib and the Russian Standard funds.
"Joining into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to address structural challenges," notes NPF Director-General Nikolai Sidorov.
The active work to consolidate funds since April is also being carried out in the Saffmar pension group - NPF "European", "Education and Science" and "Regional Fund" - should be included in NPF " Safmar" by the end of the current year.
In 2017, they will be joined by the Doveria NPF.
"The pooling of funds will have an effect on increased control of risks, operating processes and expenditures", noted in the Saffmar pension group.
A break in the pool of funds supported by the “CIT Finances Pension Manager” may be caused by several reasons, according to experts.
Until recently, NPFs have not been able to buy more than 40 per cent of the infrastructure bonds in which the group was actively deployed.
Following amendments to the CB decision in March of this year, there are no longer any restrictions on certain issuers that meet the regulatory requirements.
If necessary, the whole issue can buy out one big game," says the Director of the Akra Financial Institutions Ratings Group, Jury Nogin.
Several NPF leaders from top-15 on assets for another possible reason call the separation of the sphere of influence and, as a result, staff appointments in a single fund that had to be agreed upon by group owners.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenko was not available for comments.
At the request of "U" in the NPF, "Gazfund" was not answered either.
While the consolidation of funds is a labour-intensive and arduous event, the decision will be justified at a long time.
As the consultant's manager Sergey Okolesnov notes, the "Gazfonda Pension Stockpiles" is smaller, accession will allow the stabilization of the base of other funds of the group.
This will require more successful experience of the KIT Finance and Progro-Funda NPF in the construction of differential sales of ODPs, as well as the use of more modern POs.
The requirements of the CBs for NPF processes and staff are constantly growing, and therefore, to double the infrastructure on the four funds in a single investment policy is not appropriate, the Managing Director for Corporate Ratings Expert RA, Pavel Mitrofanov.
"The effect of the duplication of functions clearly outweighs the possible costs of merger," noted Mr. Mitrofanov.
The cost of bringing together the four funds Sergei Okolesnov is estimated at 30 to 50 million rubles.
"The cost of the four funds of this size is approximately 400 million dollars a year, with the medium-term consolidation of the budget actually reducing twice," Mr. Okolesnow is certain.
The best discnade movie "Pit and his dragon" appeared in the Russian screen.
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the charming dragon, the life story and the country-style song enough to re-believe in old-fashioned magic, says ELENA KRAWCUN.
The frightened little girl improved the dragon, becoming a human child and a gentle nurse, and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, honors the fairy tale book, plays with him in the trailers and sleeps in the room.
Six years later, he had grown up and in a shackle, not to distinguish himself from another imaginary forest climber, Maugli.
In this way, Pete is discovered by a red-headed woman named Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while the Gavin (Karl Urban) Brigade, her husband's brother, is aggressively forested.
Now she will have to believe not only in the existence of a dragon but also in helping to save him.
Pete has a accelerated course "to be human" in the environment of the idyllic Americans who wear rubber gloves, a moral code in the heart and smile more blind than in any advertisement.
None of the characters look or act too horrible to let the viewer actually start to hate or fear him.
Even Gavin, who hunted the untypical inhabitants of his superior forest, was far away from the wrong crime.
A hugely humid dragon has also gained no fear, with a good muddy bulldog, a flying range of wings, and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon is fun, muttering, even shaking and, fortunately, does not say, because he always wants to starve, it is beneficially different from all the famous cinematic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of being held ensures such a high level of emotional involvement that, at the most tense moments, the three arms become desperate not only for small audiences but also for adults.
Amazingly good and young Oaks Figli in the role of Pete, which breaks between a possible family and the present one.
And Robert Redford is virtually publishing a cannon grandfather who would love to have literally every child.
How did director David Louri take off a fantasticly nice frame of the forgotten Disney film "Dracon Pitt" in 1977, mediated from the nose to the end of the tail and remembered only by a mix of animation and play movies, and make it the most emotional movie this summer?
Not like a miracle helped.
In his painting, Laurie from the original, in fact, took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.

Journalist RBK Aleksandru Sokołov faces new charges
Journalist Dr. RBK Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the extremist structure, stated that the prosecutor had found loopholes in their defence.
The fact that the prosecutor's office has made such a presentation is what we were told by the investigators yesterday.
We had been scheduled to attend a judicial meeting on the subject of limiting the information on criminal matters, but there was no meeting, and the investigators had informed us of the submission made by the prosecutor," says Dr. Olga Dinze.
She said that the Prosecutor ' s Office had indicated to the investigators that the qualifications of the case and the materials collected were inadequate.
The investigators will now have to remove the gaps in the evidence base and present Alexander Sokolov with a new indictment.
Or another article of the Penal Code (UC) will appear, or will remain the same, but with other evidence and new evidence, Ms. Dinze specified.
As told by "U", Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the accusation of the RBK journalist the wording of “distorting the political situation towards instability” and “injury of the authority by illegal means”.
ALEXANDR ZILBERT, the correspondent of Commersantuboscosport, experienced the life of the Olympics in the Olympic Village, inspected the house of the Russian assembly, ate at the local table, and even passed the WAD test.
Life doesn't seem to die here for a second.
Even at night.
The last startups are sometimes completed at midnight, after which the athletes need another half-hour to return to the Olympic Village.
In addition, the village and eviction take place without stopping, as some athletes finish their talks and leave Brazil, and some, on the other hand, only come here.
By 7:30 a.m., the heads of all the Olympic delegations will be held in one of the temporary tents.
In these meetings we usually discuss some operational domestic issues, as the head of the sports delegation of the Russian Olympic team, Igor Kazikov, tells us. - Despite the fact that the house where we were located, it is considered to have been put into service by the exemplary ones and demonstrated to all the examiners, even in the case of some minors.
It's a hot water problem, so I'm sorry, it's a unitasas.
We fought for purity for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
And then the clinics came, but they're just rubbing some kind of substance in the middle, yeah and everything.
They have fields, do you see any innovations?
Mol, you can't wash them humanly.
Let's know these fields are ordinary.
In general, there have been changes in the clearing company and now all OK.
The Olympic village is such a South Boutovo, a bedroom area surrounded by mountains, and by impressive rivers, with golden waters.
There is still a two-metre rail fence around the perimeter for reliability.
The whole village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
In one of the 18-storey buildings, a huge Russian flag is hung - this house is completely dedicated to our collection.
With a small foiege at the entrance, it is possible to determine immediately what problems appear to be the most pressing for the national team.
Two announcements are pending: "Please don't throw a paper in the toilet!" and from the hand of "Primo in gift badges.
It's the same stop that sinks into the loops.
Their fun color contrasts with the headlines of the brochure: "Infectious Diseases in Rio de Janeiro", "First Aid in Heating, the fall of the international body in respiratory pathways, loss of consciousness - stages of heart-laughing renaissance", "First Aid in Fires, Hot Hits, Violations and Bleeding".
Text inside is generally encouraging.
For example: “Infection is accompanied by disease and subsequent treatment.
However, not all are waiting for a favorable outcome.
Of course, Russia has a medical centre that is ready at any time to provide qualified assistance to residents, including relaxing and sporting massages.
On the contrary, the centre is the headquarters of our delegation.
A number with the door is an inspiring cry, "No matter what we win!"
Well, of course, the verses are:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who fear (Allah) will believe in it.
Let's cut it off, that taste of victory, Russia won't fall, it won't break!
And for the more exalted of the spirit is the announcement: O dear brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all of Russia, Kirilla is carrying out the spiritual care of athletes of the Russian Olympic Assembly by Andrey Vladimirovich Alekseyev.
You can order a request and other requirements on the phone...
In fact, there is a Centre for Meditation and Religious Cemetery for All Confessions.
Well, the russians, in a privileged position, have their own watch.
Due to the load of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to land on the ladder recommended to be used during the fire.
And in the darkness there was a glimpse of the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, they were sleeping employees of a new clanging company.
I believe that at any point in time, they decided to set up a quiet time just on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was waiting for a meeting with an old acquaintance, Vitalie Fedorovic Dubko, a coach of our battalians, who brought them to the Olympic gold in Sydney another 16 years ago.
He and his educator, a European champion, Jan Paul, kindly agreed to show his rooms.
We're living in two, sleeping, of course, almost impatience, but it's not critical.
Sanselle's one on the fourth, but that's why it's spacious.
Schaff, of course, funny, out of fabric, trust doesn't trigger, but things can be put.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
It is called the main site, at least because it represents the area of 2.7 thousand sq.m. and is ready to accept at the same time 5,000 visitors.
There's six thousand servings in the day for free.
The options of the menu are the following: "Bottles from Brazil", "Cooks of Peace", "Asian Guards" and "Pize, Macaronics".
The last option, as I looked at, is the popularity of our volleyballists.
And let's say I didn't find soup in any of the giant restaurants.
What kind of soup?
It's a good thing I took Chinese with me, wild.
And a teapot.
But, you know, we've got worse food in the shorts.
There's something you can choose here, despite the unbearable uniformity.
I personally picked a pair of spruces and peanuts in a tomato sauce.
A table with its name in three languages, English, French and Portuguese, as well as an indication of the food value of the product and the availability of allergens, is available.
Well, admit it was.
I don't even know why that's always in local McDonald's.
We can say that “hot” athletes on the way out of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends, representatives of the World Anti-Oting Agency (WADA).
They're cheating on the victor who's got a football player.
They're provocative, you can say!
In order to receive a gift, at least eight of the ten questions must be answered correctly.
There are questions in Russian! - I was attacked by a girl from WADA.
But that's not what she attacked.
That's what I'm doing in the patriotic break, of course.
The situation has already been raised on the second question: "If I have received notification of doping control, should I immediately go to the doping control?"
I said, "No, I have one hour."
He's lost, so to speak, vigilance.
I've forgotten that WAD's weakness is not to be expected.
In general, we need to be right away.
Well, at the seventh stage, my situation became quite critical.
Why did I think that if I find it difficult to keep a balanced diet because of my flat schedule (and I find it difficult!), I can use bio-additionals to get "additional nutrients to enhance my productivity".
No, they're not!
More precisely, the answer is that categorically they do not prohibit, but they insist on, in a number of proposals.
It's WADA!
How's it going, Russia?
To retreat somewhere behind Efimova, Isinbaeva and all of our evicted team.
That's why I've focused, and I've won an accident football since the last day.
Know what it says, ours!
In a winning mood, I went to the fitness center next door.
Get involved in coaching.
He's down to 250.
It was surprising to note that no Russian sportsman was found in this raid of the runaway roads.
But maybe it's right?
Let him who can't play be trained!
And there's one of our guys sitting in a nearby clinic.
In turn to the eyelid.
Don't worry, don't shoot.
In the clinic, however, as well as in the entire village, there's a storage machine hanging out.
And there's an exciting call in it, "Take the condom."
There is nothing left but to roll the iron that reminds the handle of the door lock, and the containers made from the Amazon's natural latex are ready to come out of the machine.
I took one, remember.
It won't be easy for athletes to take them to 450 thousand.
The Olympic Village has an entire entertainment centre for holiday and holiday entertainment.
In any case, his mind is a signboard that reminds the International Olympic Committee that it spends $3.25 million a day on sportsmen in different ways.
The centre features video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey and some strange devices similar to video trainers.
What is that? - I'm interested in a company in the form of a Ukrainian collection that actively uses a wild game.
I could, of course, just say he doesn't want to talk to a man in the form of a Russian assembly, yes and everything.
Here, in some strange way, it's in the eye that fish from the baby in yellow-blue.
It's the most playful collection ever.
It takes not less than three hours to walk around the village, looking at every corner of it.
But, if you're walking, not riding on the electricians, you're going to open up the house of a Canadian leather band at the entrance and a closet with a refurbished bathroom, and a ticket office, and a lawn, and a gym, and a park store, and a flower shop, and a box with daily consumer goods, and a box with unique brands (only you can't transfer from the Chinese philatelics), and the bank, and the office of findings, and photoosque.
And late in the evening, you'll be sitting next to an olive tree hanging with various colored strips in mind for the leftovers of this world's friends and athletes.
And you're going to be under a combination of a machine that's indisputably liquid to kill the insects, thinking of eternity.
It's about the Olympic movement.
Which doesn't stop in this village for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was inhaling, it was observed that the Australians had not been punishing the American Dream Team, these patients had gone online.
Few people know: the news that Inna Deriglasza won the gold in the stripper at the XXXI Olympics, I got the first one.
Maybe I'm the only muscle that's ever seen how it happened -- not to those who were looking at the Carioca competition that night.
This can only be understood by the present patient.
Here's a good night in Moscow.
Neighbors down - as they always do at night - fall asleep and begin to cry out in anger, but very loudly.
And threatening to drive a furniture.
There's no time to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
There's nothing in the TV schedule, so he just kept track of the Match, the First, and in any case, Russia -- although it's almost pointless.
Russia is a family of repeats, all sports there for a reason in the records.
It's where the live air series is broadcast.
Hope, of course, at the Match - all night a young man screamed in news releases first about the great semifinal Deriglasa-Shanaeva, then about the imminent battle for gold.
It would make sense to show.
But instead, basketball is the United States-- Australia.
I can't say anything wrong about that.
Australians were equal, the first half won at all.
They put in place officers of their own size.
As a result, they have lost, but, as they say, the basketball tournament will no longer be an old one.
It's all right, but it's close to a fight with Dee Francis, and on the screen without change.
In an easy panic, I start writing channels.
That's the feeling, the second time in a row.
All right, let's go deep, on the cables.
There's no "Matthew" on any of the subjects.
And, in my opinion, the fight will begin.
Text and tweeting of some sports sites don't bother me.
The surrogate provides an unexpected but brilliant result.
On the First page, there is a direct technical transmission of all competitions that are currently taking place.
I'm clicking on the engagement, I'm getting a unit for gold.
Deriglas highly contractate, go forward - and clearly start to take time.
Italians play almost all the fumes.
Our one point forward, to the end of two seconds.
Di Francisco is thrown into Deriglasz and retreats, time is running out, Italians are going around.
Victory!
In a few seconds, an Olympic messenger on the phone reported the fourth gold medal.
I'm the first to see it with my own eyes.
The foolish, the faithful, the partisans.
Tatarstan's spiritual administration (DUM) refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the DUM had forced its crews to preach Friday only in Tatar to force young tatars to “recognize their native language”.
The board states that this is "no harm in any case" to the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, Kazani felt that the Tatar language did not understand up to 60 per cent of foreigners, including foreign students, migrants and tatars themselves.
Imams are afraid that their Tatar sermons will “not reach the entire audience”.
Yesterday, DUM Tatarstan's prisoner unanimously decided to hold Friday's sermons in the Republic's mosques only in Tatar language.
As Tatarstan Camil Samigulin said, it should be an incentive for young tattoos to “research their native language”.
"For those who say it's "hard" in each large mosque, we intend to organize the Tatar language lessons absolutely free," promised Mr. Samigulin.
He added that “the decision has already entered into force” and today, in all mosques, “must be in Tatar language”.
He recalled that the Tatarstan DUM publishes the magazine Shura with typical Tatar sermons.
I've got a guy who doesn't say well enough to say, "It can be prepared basically."
DUM Tatarstan brings together more than a thousand revenues in all the municipalities of the Republic.
According to Muftia, Friday’s sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, the Russian language was mostly used in several mosques in Kazana.
In particular, as the Mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnaev Mosque, Zakaban and Eniler.
However, Mr. Muhamethin stressed, the leadership tasked all students with both national languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
"No matter what harm the Muslim-netar may not be," stressed Mr. Muhamatshin, explaining that the preaching itself is “not a binding, fundamental part of the mind”.
In doing so, the namaz will continue to read in Arabic, lessons and lessons in Russian will be preserved in the mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Muhamethin said "U", that there was no serious threat of the removal of the Tatar language from the mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar languages, such as Uzbek or Tadjik, it is reported that there is no use in the Republic of Russia.
The decision of the DUM was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Tatar Congress (WCT).
The head of the U.K.P.O. Rinat Zakirov said "U" "Mechetti is an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language had left this area.
He noted that preaching in the Tatar language was “the desire of the Imams” but in the WCT, they “considered it to be correct”.
The asked "U" have those who preach in Russian who are prepared to comply with the DUM decision, but they believe that there will be difficulties with the understanding of the ministers.
There are tatars and Russians in the castle.
Many do not understand the language.
Of course they'll be sad.
"It's going to be a long time," says I have the Burnaev Mosque of Farhat Mawletdinov.
He said that preaching in Russian was closer to many tatars, since “Russian in schools and in children, on the radio, where it was originally.”
However, he believed that the mosque would be able to continue the lessons and lessons in the Russian language that were held on other days.
We trust in God.
"Allah will show you the way out of this (state)."
But about 60% of us don't know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbek and Tajik and Azerbaijani.
There are many foreign students: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we've been in Russian for four years," I said.
He believes that in the Tatar language, sermons will “come to a narrower circle and not go to the whole audience.”
But we will be subject to the decision of the prisoner.
The result of the preaching work will be different.
But time will show.
"I, for example, will only be easier, because the Tatar language is my native," said Gabdulla Galliulin.
Former Director of the FSIIN
The Moscow Public Prosecutor ' s Office has passed an indictment on the CSU's investigation of the criminal theft of the budget allocated to the Russian FSIN.
The former head of the prison department, Alexander Reimer, and his deputy, who caused the FSIIN damage, will be brought before the court.
The Permanent Prosecutor ' s Office sent a criminal case to the Zamoskovorice court with respect to former Director of FSIIN of Russia Alexander Reimer, his former Deputy Nikola Krivolapov, as well as the Director of the FGUP "The Information and Technology Services Centre and the Association of the Federal Service for the Enforcement of Penalties " (FGUP CITOS) by Victor Odielenova.
Depending on the role and extent of participation in the commission of crimes, they are accused by the CCCH of Moscow under Art. 285 of the RF (use of heavy-duty officials) and Art. 159 of the RF (manufacture made using their official position in the organized group, particularly large).
In addition, Kryvolapov is accused under article 222 of the RF (unlawful acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the CDC, in 2010-2012, the persons identified by fraud were deprived of the budgetary resources allocated to the FSIIN to provide the department with electronic monitoring systems of the persons under control, so-called electronic brochures.
In order to steal the budget money, the group developed a scheme under which the CITOS FCHF, with which the relevant public contracts were concluded, produced control and oversight techniques, including “electronic brochures”, and implemented several times at prices.
Although CITOS FGUP had no production equipment, buildings, facilities for the placement of production capabilities, enabling the final cycle of the production of “electronic armchairs” between them and FSIIN Russia, five gocontrates amounting to more than 3.3 billion rubles were concluded.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubbs were seized in the Samar branch of the GSPF, of which 1.2 billion rubbs were stolen.
According to the investigation, over 140 million of the funds recovered were personally received by Mr. Reymer in his office by one of the partners in respect of whom a criminal case was handed over to a separate trial.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who participated in the machining, found an unknown origin of the cartridge to the awarding gun, which allowed him to present an additional charge.
In this case, the amount of 133 volumes, FSIIN claimed that the claimed material damage amounted to 2.7 billion rubles.
Soccer Hakan Shukure is suspected of taking part in the trip.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former footballer and then a member of the Hakan Shukure parliament and conducted searches into his family's two houses.
The Turkish football star of the 1990s, the beginning of the 2000s, attacked by Hakan Shukure, is being investigated by the country ' s authorities for attempted coup d'état last month.
Forvard, who completed his sports career in 2008, was accused of belonging to an “armed terrorist group”.
This is the Hizmet movement, a society associated with a well-known Turkish religious figure and opposition to Fethol Gulen.
It was his President Erdogan who was the organizer of the attempt to convert the war that took place on 15 July.
Fetholah Gulen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
Local media reported that an arrest warrant for Hakan Shukure had been issued today, and the police had already searched two homes belonging to the former footballer's family.
According to the investigation, his father was also involved in the organization of Fathullah Gulen, apart from Hakan Shukuura himself.
However, neither the former footballer nor his close friends proved to be there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
In the home of a footballer, Hakan Shukuur protected the colors of several Turkish clubs and spoke for the assembly country.
He spent most of his career in Galatasara.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian "Torno", "Inter" and "Palarmo", as well as English "Blackburn".
True, he did not spend more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Shukuur is still the most effective attacker of the gathering of Turkey, with 112 fighters for the national team and 51 civilians killed.
In 2013, Hakan Shukuur left his post due to an initial corruption investigation into the Erdogan party and its immediate surroundings.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, an order was issued in Turkey on 25 July to arrest at least 42 journalists.
They are accused of promoting the military revolution and the links with the opposition Islamic preacher Fethol Gulen, who lives in the United States.
Given the severity of the charges, media staff can wait for long prison terms from ten years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovski wants to create a film theater network only for national films.
"I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for the Russian cinema, which stood at 2-3 times less than for films of foreign production," he said.
Mr. Konchalovski noted that Russian films were difficult to compete for the audience with large Hollywood strips.
We have more than 100 paintings in the country every year, of which 20-25 tapes are on average.
"And even they find it very difficult to compete with "Transformers" and "The Iron Man", where huge budgets are being made," the film director said.
Remember, on 1 July, the “Tavrida” World Youth Education Forum began working in Crimea.
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals from various creative and humanitarian areas across Russia and a number of neighbouring and distant countries.

Former Deputy Governor Nikolai Sandakova Konstantin Akulic was detained in Miasse, Chile.
According to U-South Ural, another accused lawyer, Sergei Kolosovski, Konstantin Akulic, today has been called upon to investigate the CDR Miass to file an annual case of execution.
At that time, Constantine Akulic went to the DTP as a lawyer for the assistance of one of his participants.
"It was originally initiated against unestablished persons, and now that he began protecting Nikolai Sandakova, it turned out to be Akulic," says Sergei Kolosovski.
Konstantin Akulic became a former deputy governor's lawyer in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before a lawyer's call to the DRC, the defence party was informed that Monday was due to be informed of the fraud cases in which Nikolai Sandakova was accused.

For more information on the case, please read in the "U" material "Exterior Vice-Governor requires the merger of his affairs".
The Russian Medieval Company (RMC) is prepared to take on social responsibility and to pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMC has considered the modernisation of one of the country's oldest and most environmentally " grassy " enterprises, the Caribbean med-floor combination.
The Karabash Meadow plant was founded by an English shareholder company in the head of Lesley Urkwart in 1910.
In Soviet times, this was important to the economy of the industrial industry, and it actually ensured the viability of the whole city.
In the 1990s, however, production was halted because of financial problems, resulting in serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, a decision was taken to resume the work of the Karabakh Meadow Joint.
It was also necessary to address one of the major environmental problems of the Caribbean.
By the early 2000s, Karabash had already been known as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the company was run by the Russian dairy company.
The company began modernizing production, gradually reducing environmental pressures on the environment.
This was noted recently by the Governor of the Chelyabean Region, Boris Dubrovski, who visited the Karabashmedi in early July.
The head of the South Urala called for the huge changes that have taken place with the company since "Karabashmede" went to the RMK group.
The main event on the modernization of Karabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new sernicoslurgical vessel, which can catch up to 99.9 per cent of the metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Medieval Company, the amount of investment in the project amounted to some 7 billion rubles.
The next phase of the modernization of the CARABASMEDI ZAO is the reconstruction of the converter.
The replacement of three converters, vacuum cleaners and gas tractors is scheduled at the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubs.
In addition, at the end of 2016, a new price of 1 billion rubles for industrial goods is planned to be launched.
In turn, taxes on the city of Karabash will also increase.
The federal penalty will be 8.9 billion rubs for the entire duration of the Tominian GOK project - from the start of construction and before the second phase of operation.
After the introduction of the GOC, the total budget revenue of all levels may be 80.9 billion rubs.
For the year of production in the Varnen region, the budgets at various levels are 346.3 million rubles.
And this is the first year.
"As long as the company works successfully, the amount of the deductions may be higher," added Valerius Ulanovski.
In the RMC, it was clarified that the tax deductions from the Micheev GOK in 2015 amounted to 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of businesses in the lives and development of the territories is not limited to tax deductions.
The RMK companies help to repair and maintain schools, children's gardens, sports facilities, build cultural and entertainment facilities, and maintain the territory.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian dairy company in Karabash became capital repairs, and in fact, the restructuring of the N9 child store was almost complete for 95 educators.
The building, built in 1960, was in an emergency condition.
Also on the territory of RMC Arena, a landscape park with artificial dust, underground and underground parking for 600 machinery, coffee and sports shops will be located.
The RMC Arena will provide excellent international professional sports activities.
But the main objective of this project is to make exercise of physics and sport in comfortable conditions available to the inhabitants of Čelabinska, especially for children.

WSJ: The United States is considering sanctions against the RF because of the break-in of democratic servers.
U.S. officials are considering introducing new sanctions against Russia in response to the crackdown of the Democratic Party's servers, writes The Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
The U.S. President Barack Obama's administration is reported to have to be formally charged with attacks on Russian servers or supported by the Russian hackers.
According to sources, the FBI and other American services are almost convinced of Russia's participation in cybercrime.
WSJ notes that the United States usually prefers not to mention the hackers.
The exception is the entry of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database, which was officially entrusted to the DPRK in 2014.
However, last year Obama issued an order facilitating the imposition of sanctions on those who implement or promote cybercrime.
It was originally directed against China, but could also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions may be long, says the publication.
Even if officials came to the conclusion that the hackers had been operating with the support of Russia, they would have to bear the possible consequences before deciding to disclose information.
They have to determine whether it is such a serious incident to exacerbate bilateral tensions.
It was previously reported that the Barack Obama administration allowed the use of sanctions against the State whose hackers had broken down the servers of the Democratic Party ' s National Committee.
WikiLeaks has published an electronic copy of the National Democratic Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in burglary.
In Kremlin, such messages were called absurd.
FAS punished Google almost half a billion rubles
There has been a distortion of competition in the mobile applications market.
The anti-monopoly procedure was initiated at the "Andesa" initiative.
The Russian company claimed that Google provides smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components under conditions that prohibited the use of applications from other developers, in particular from "Andes".
FAS found confirmation of these claims and found that the company abused the dominant position on the market and imposed on mobile devices manufacturers the installation along with the Google Play store of other applications.
As a result of the verification, the Federal Anti-Money Service decided to punish Google, told FAS leader Alexei Docenko.
The fine shall be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
In FAS, it was concluded that the competition protection law should be observed by all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends to study the decision first, and only then will it be determined with further action: to execute it or challenge it.
The Federal Antitrust Service recognized the company as a competitor of the Competition Act in September last year and ordered that contracts be adjusted by 18 December.
However, Google did not agree.
Since then, the company and the department have been in trial.
In FAS, it was noted that despite the fine, they discussed with Google the possibility of concluding a world agreement.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This was the opinion of the leading analyst of the Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin, Ehu Moscow.
Murtazine also noted that the fine would not affect the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

"Anime" effect Snapchat criticises as a caricature of Asians
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by an animal, but some viewers say it is racially insatiable.
With the help of the Snapchat tool, about 150 million users are able to change the reality and play with individuality in ways that limit absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a person to stand up to Roy Liechtenstein.
Lenses are rough, distorting lines of instruments that create more than 30 million adjusted self-sess per day.
Any mistakes quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat's lenses were criticized in the past when they were accused that the application had advertised the dark skin of the person or encouraged the distinguished persons as the ideal of beauty.
So when some users this week were offered a lens that gave them hairy eyes, curved teeth, and soft cheeks, some critics considered it a racist character for Asians, yellows.
And they asked whether these repeated contradictions indicated a more serious problem for a company related to diversity.
On Wednesday, reports were circulated and there was a subsequent malaise in reports on The Verge and Motherboard, the next day after Snapchat stated that they had removed this function.
The company commented: The lens was designed to respect the characters of an animal rather than as an Asian cartoon.
But experts who know that racism is not hearing, Linza recalled the offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison of animals.
In his e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose photo tweets were actively shared, said that the lens was "stricken and at least impassable".
She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison of the sides on the side with very rough caricatures on the Asians and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just geltolitics, but to a maximum extent destructive geltolitics.
Snapchat is not the only company that passes through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, starting from corporate halls to Hollywood and the Davis, which we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people in Snapchat, who are more racially diverse than their older generation, can mean that they are more likely to expect understanding.
When one of Snapchat's lens created an image that was insulting to the user, she said in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Ju, "that the course of events is much more difficult to stay undetected than it was before."
On Thursday, Ju, the Production Manager and the Engineer working on the Medium, decided to remove their recording in Snapchat and urged others to do the same.
In the article for the Medium and in the telephone interview, she said that racial contradictions were the cause of insufficient diversity in the recruitment of Snepchat.
Ju criticised the predominantly white leadership of the company, consisting only of men and ended up with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Jou, who is the American of Chinese origin, wrote: "Because they do not have enough white people in the state to make such decisions, or they do not have white people, but they do not hold positions to be safe and open."
Other viewers share her view, expressing discontent that Snapchat had not answered most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, stressing its status as a private company.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his staff, but, according to a trusted person, the company had recently hired a recruiter to focus on insufficiently represented populations and on active attempts to engage in domestic resources.
For his part, Ju said she would keep her account in Snapchat closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say that they won't do that."
Military leadership has violated IGIL intelligence, reports congress commission
Officials from the U.S. Central Armed Forces have amended intelligence reports to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the ground for the events on the ground, the congress commission reported on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group, established by the Presidents of the Committee of the Chamber of Representatives for the Cases of the BC, the Committee on Intelligence and the Subcommittee on Military Provisions, identified “wide-ranging dissatisfaction” among analysts of the Central Command Intelligence Service, who claimed that the leaders had undermined their assessments of American actions aimed at winning over the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military administration in the city of Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The research documents confirmed by Centcom's Supreme Command generally gave a more optimistic picture of US anti-terrorism action than is confirmed by actual data from the scene and were more optimistic than the analysis provided by other special services," the report said.
"What has happened in Centcoma is unacceptable: when the senior management is presented with an uncertain analysis, our military suffers," said a member of the Chamber of Representatives Ken Calvert, a Republican of California.
The problems of leadership in Centcom are the highest in the organization.
The ten-sided report explains in detail the shortcomings that have constantly arisen in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training Iraq's armed forces provided by the Central Command.
While it does not contain definitive evidence that the members of Obama ' s management have ordered the falsification of the reports, he argues that the analysts felt that Centcom ' s management made them more optimistic about the threat from the Islamic State, also known as the IGIL or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony of the Central Command at Congress were much more optimistic than actual events," the report reported.
For example, an official of Centcoma publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at returning to Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is probably known," said a member of the House of Representatives Mike Pompey, a Republican of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the U.S. Central Command's highest intelligence management has been subscribing command intelligence documents to reduce the threat from IGIL in Iraq.
The Republicans set up an operational group when they learned that the analysts had expressed concern that the intelligence of the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, more disaggregated data will follow the report published on Thursday.
An additional, pending investigation by the reconnaissance officer of the Ministry of Defence is being conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Defence.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the U.S. Congress Chamber Intelligence Committee published their own data on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican operational group.
“From 2014 to 2015, Centco has established an over-closed investigation procedure for IGIL and Iraqi security forces,” claims a member of the Chamber of Representatives Adam B. Shiff, the lead representative of the Democratic Party in the Committee.
This procedure, according to Shifa, "has halted the issuance of intelligence documents", has damaged the morale of analysts and "is insufficient to reflect the dispersal views".
But Shiff and the Democrats claim that there was no evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom's analysts to raise their conclusions under "duty or political interpretation".
Preliminary results of the Congress' investigation were presented in Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of an investigation by the Chief Inspector of the Pentagon, which was opened after the complaints of the Centcoma analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the congress until the Chief Inspector's investigation continued.
But he said that “experts sometimes rely on integrated data, and the Special Services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital topics relating to national security”.
The consequences of the investigation are beyond the scope of whether the goals of the US-led bombing in Iraq and Syria (as the Ministry of Defence is now increasingly adopting).
Last year, however, statements raise doubts as to whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
The criticism of the Islamic State's intelligence repeats the disputes that took place over ten years ago when an analyst for Centcoma Gregory Hucker wrote a research article that claimed that President George Walker Bush's administration, owing to a protest, had supported a small number of troops in Iraq and had not thought about what followed the 2003 invasion.
Hacker also played a key role in the protest caused by the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, the Hukera team concluded that despite public statements about the return, oil pipelines belonging to the Islamic State did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group because it had built temporary oil pipelines to sell oil on the black market.
But the opening was not spread outside the Central Command, as reported in September of the Times.
The then Commander of Centcoma, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised last year after the witnesses' testimony in the Senate, which many MPs considered to be too optimistic about the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel in Central Command.
The U.S.A. beats four times in female hockey on grass, thus approaching the decisive grasp of Britain
Killing once three goals in a match that ended with a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bem opened the first two goals for a US women's hockey team on the grass when the Americans won a 3-0 win over the Indian team.
Five heads in two games must be a memorable achievement, but Bem, 27 years old, says she's not sure if she would ever do anything like that.
"I don't mind," she said.
I'm really not one of those people who follow their goals.
That's what she knows: the American 4-0 account in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for the first place in their team with Britain, which remains invincible after Japan's win with the 2-0 account on Thursday.
The British and U.S. teams will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round.
Both teams claim a quarter, and the result of the game will determine who will take the first place in their group of six teams, and who will be the second.
The winner will avoid meetings with a strong team of opponents from the Netherlands, the leaders of another group, in a bit of a while when the four-final games begin.
However, the Saturday game shows that the Americans here made a noise of their unexpected series four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams in the London games.
Bem was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time she took a hooket on grass when she was 3 (the older twin sisters played this kind of sport in Drexel) and joined the national gathering at the age of 16 and became the youngest player in history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008, when she did not go through the final round.
Then came 2012 when she and her teammate did not have everything to do with her.
The next year, Coyg Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed a coach, and everything began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical training," said Bem.
In London, we didn't have the productivity that we have now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bem opened the account in the first half of the game with a brush with an uncomfortable hand for a short distance.
India went to the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team was surprised and kept account 1-0 until the end of the third period when Bem took the initiative in his hands.
She took a long walk with a ball down the left side of the field, then the spiral went in the middle and had a sharp ball in the door, thus giving the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa Gonzales added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The "dry" win was the first at the U.S. door tournament Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's hit.
Like Bem.
"We are in a good position right now," said Parnham, but how well it depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
In the midst of the unrest of the Olympic Games - "day" of the buns on the bat
Wherever you are, no matter what time it is now, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be unchanging and inevitable, a long-term combination of competition and aspirations.
It's the Olympic fire itself, and there's the hot façade that's being transferred from the shipper to the gymnast, to the triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's talk in the coffee line, and not hear about Simon Bayls, Katie Ledeki or the hostility between Michael Felps and Chad de Clo.
And there's still Logan Duley.
Duly, for the first time involved in the Olympics, a beautician with rabbits, could be among the celebrities shown in the premieres promoted by sponsors and life-threatening advertising roles, if he was a sailor, a gymnast or even a festive.
But 28-year-old Duley from Lake Forest in California is fighting for gold in Olympic matches on the bat.
The Olympic Fire does not highlight all events the same.
In addition to the centre, partly in the shadows, there are sports that are not generally recognized: pneumatic gun shooting, bow shooting, badminton, tekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, long kingdom.
But if I'm allowed to speak for my personal passion, let me draw your attention to the modest rotation of the bees on the boat.
Although battalions have been an Olympic type of sport since 2000, when they competed in Sydney, over the past 16 years, they have received so little recognition that many people who have been asked about me have not been aware that they are in general about the Olympic type of sport.
This may be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to competitions, they never won medals in boots and their athletes did not go to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russian usually share male awards, while Chinese and Canadians are female.
Dun Dun from China and Rosie McLennan from Canada will protect their London gold medals this year.
But the boots on the boot have the charm of an outsider, especially because for the uneducated ear, they are more associated with a circus college than with the Olympics.
This is where I have to admit that I'm not an expert, I'm just a grounded enthusiasm.
They really have a comical potential — a caricature of endless bees — but also the presence of gymnastics and bees in water, two types of sports that they mostly combine in themselves.
The word "bhutt" comes from the Spanish word "el trampoline", which means "tramplin for bees in water."
The winners are on a giant battalion, flying almost 30 feet in the air, and must carry out a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bolts and salt) to the final ground.
They are assessed according to performance, complexity and time travel, according to the official Olympic Games programme.
Thirty-two sportsmen from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will meet in Rio.
The most widely distributed Olympic course is ahead.
Medal applicants should go further, faster, higher and higher in pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forth, over there in the field.
They seek not only the final drawing or the starting wall, but also, like a telecamera, the other hostile border: the world record or the Olympic record.
This persistent desire is noble, worthy of admiration, even fanatical — and is enough to force even the viewer to pass.
But it, in my opinion, is getting a little tired when you watch the game.
He's the one with the boots on the boot.
The battista's direction is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps, looks like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then no effort up again.
And of course, they don't run without competition or difficulties, but there's no foolish turn to finish throughout the program, there's no twins in length, only a strange, clear disappearance of time and gravity.
It's the closest to the day of the Olympic sport.
Women ' s qualification contests and then the final will take place on Friday, the day-to-day broadcast in Eastern European time; the male on Saturday, also on the hour.
NBC will transmit the finals under the agenda from 14:00 a.m. to both days.
In the course of the Olympic Consciousness, there is a peaceful, beautiful moment that can be easily viewed in the common trunk.
And if a growing awareness can only be achieved by men ' s sportsmen who are driven by views and objectivization -- as Wall Street Journal said recently, the men of the gymnasts from the United States -- Duli is just waiting for her new amazing crowd of fans.
The Protest Generation in Ethiopia, a former US ally
Eurasian protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia faced fierce opposition from the Government.
The witnesses say that dozens of Protestants were killed in clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really at the edge of the gap?
For the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly developing economy.
But in recent months, anti-governmental protests have shaken the country, extending to an increasing number of its territories.
Only in the last week did thousands of people go to the streets, requiring radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s reaction was cruel.
The witnesses claimed that police officers had shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos from the protest sites allegedly taken at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put their hands on the wall.
The United Nations High Officer on Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country from falling apart, and it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project in the international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country of Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and almost no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia is evolving at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly – there is even a new suburban train in Addis Ababa.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Ethiopia, however, was hardly a model of democracy — human rights organizations constantly referred to governmental repression — opposition in the territory of the State was interrupted by the fact that dissidents had actually been forced to silence.
Many of them were imprisoned, imprisoned, killed or expelled in remote deserts.
But it can change.
"If people keep pushing and leaving other options other than protesting, they will rise," said Seium Teshom, a lecturer at the university in central Ethiopia.
All young people protest.
The generation protests.
The complaints are numerous, starting with land use, ending with the Government Coalition.
Following the widely criticised elections last year, the Government party and its allies have fully resisted the opposition and are now controlling 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tension along the border with Eritrea has grown; the struggle for this uncertain, controversial border has taken hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts are afraid that separatist groups, which have been destroyed more or less in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use the waves and rearm themselves.
A number of factors explain why the bitter feelings of a few years of insomnia in the depths of the soul are now raging.
First, it would seem completely harmless: smartphones.
In recent years only a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate in social networks, as cheap smartphones have become popular and Internet services have improved.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through the proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this was the way they were organized for protests.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhar, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhara from the predominantly Christian high mountains of Ethiopia has flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of which are Muslims and live in low areas.
But that also changes.
"We will act together under one start," said Mulat Gemechu, leader Oromo.
Major protests took place in the areas of Amharic and Oromo.
Many of Amharic and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigris ethnic group, which is about 6 per cent of the population, which controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenaui.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, until his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have predicted danger.
Analysts claim that he was particularly experienced in identifying the first signs of discontent and using investigators to obtain data and disassembly of opponents.
"The current regime is not healthy enough," said Abdi, an analyst for conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Heilemariam Desalen, appeared and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was born from the Tigris region in northern Ethiopia, Heilemariam is a Southerner.
Analysts say it does not use the trust of the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that this will lead to even more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such concerns in 2005, after thousands of people protested that, as analysts have said, it was the election that the Government called for and then presented the results.
During the subsequent repressions, many Protestants were killed, although at a lower rate than in the past few months, and this period of riots was relatively rapid.
The development experts expressed appreciation to the Ethiopian leaders for the far-sighted development of infrastructure, such as the new international train and significant success in the fight against poverty.
But obviously this did not stop the growth of domestic discontent by the Ethiopian Government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Honduras, the city of Amharic, attacked enterprises belonging to Tigray, and anti-Tigrian hatred in social networks became comprehensive.
Analysts claim that the protests make the United States and other Western allies uncomfortable.
The US Government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighboring Somalia, although it had recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose power in the already unstable region.
"And it's gonna be hard to get through this stuff," said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his statement that IGIL was founded by Obama, "sarkasm."
Donald J. Trump tried to replace the last conflict that covered his pre-election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when several times this week he claimed that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State's terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the candidate to address the American people in a sensible manner as President of the Republic.
It also put his replacements, who tried to protect him during a period of trouble, into an awkward situation, because they had to explain the statements that he probably did not mean.
In expressing this assumption on Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his statement on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the president and Clinton had founded IGIL.
But in the post office on Twitter this morning, on Friday, Trump wrote that he was just e-mailing.
This post was a direct contradiction to the claim made only a day earlier when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his indictment.
When a radio-conservator, Hugh Hewitt, tried to help Trump to ease his speech, reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy IGIL, the candidate for the president of the Republican Party did not take advantage of the opportunity.
The last scandal raged when Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy in the face of a decline in ratings.
Trump and Clinton spoke with competing issues about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to go back to the subject.
But once again he turned to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would increase taxes, and he said it was boring.
Trump used sarcasm as an excuse before.
At the end of July, after he had come across a general criticism, practically expressing the idea that the Russians should break Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his comments, saying, "I'm kidding at last."
Such an approach allows Trump to go beyond the political limits and to take his words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing some of the messages that are responding to his worshipers to see how they work and then "explain them on the other side, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert, analyzing the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is careful in his statements, and he knows that they are smeared enough to treat them differently.
Instead of easing speeches for a large electorate, Trump has taken even more vulnerable tone in the last few days, while his rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, published on Friday, showed that Trump is moving to North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and is heading to Florida.
Although Trump is usually trying not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and not understanding his sense of humor.
But since Trump has become the focus of the presidential campaign in recent months, his jokes have put his faithful allies in an awkward position: they must publicly support him, whatever the provocations were.
Rudolf U. Juliani, former mayor of New York, who is one of the most well-known Deputy Trump, has made serious efforts to protect the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an acceptable political comment," Juliani said when asked him about the authenticity of the trump's claim that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that by Obama IGIL was almost unknown by a small organization, he called it a non-hazardous threat, absolutely unjust, and that is why it happened because he had taken the army out of Iraq.
Most of the medium-sized Republicans believe that Obama ' s administration, in which Clinton served as the Secretary of State, has allowed IGIL to develop because it has failed to cope with the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to the meeting in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media on the subject of each of his words and prejudice against him.
He joked about the poor, unhappy TV experts who were trying to figure him out, and he said, "They're weak!"
Some of the democracies have ridiculed the Thramp's excuses as too much to confirm that it is not due to the president.
Once the distilled coffee is returned to Greenpoint
The Verb coffee was spread out, taking only the cash place in Williamsberg, where there was no Wi-Fi, but a good coffee was delivered for 15 years.
Of course, she was pulled out of her window room at Bedford Avenue.
Shop Soup Sherry, which took place in the summer of 2014, is selling soap in the form of cakes.
Locals mourned her as the last loss in the refreshing city.
The artist Molly Krabapl wrote on Twitter: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB's dead, Chelsea's hotel is destroyed, and Verb has now become a soap store."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is, in turn, being updated.
The Verb coffee was reborn last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
In the new Verbe there are Wi-Fi and credit cards, but there are some of the same staff and like a simple atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
The head of the new "Verba" is Sisko Rodríguez, a former officer of the old cafe, who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to propose him in a new place, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, who was 36 years old, left many in his former form.
"Verb" works with the same beige distributor and bought the same coffee machine model.
It even contains the old "Verba" patterns.
But Rodríguez said he would also like to experiment.
He proposed new candles.
The menu contains bacon, eggs and cheese sandwiches and there is a capper topping or a burning bow.
There's a guard of a stormy quality.
There's no beer in the coffee shop, but now fresh juices are being prepared.
Nine months later, Rodríguez said that he had drawn attention to the constant flow of old customers.
"Many of the former customers also paid prices from Williamsburg," he said.
In one recent resurrection, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliver, who was 34 years old, lived in Williamsburg and visited Verb frequently.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went there.
After the lockdown, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me at Verbe," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, although on that day instead of the usual ice-coffee she ordered a cup of tea, another newspaper.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-standing client, has been faithfully visiting Verb since 2003.
He went to work and ordered the same.
"At fifteen minutes of eighth, every day, as in hours, I came, and prepared for me my bee with butter and all manners," he said.
Rodríguez said he wanted to experiment and introduce new meals in the menu.
Today, Rosenthal is still making an ordinary order, but he's ever changing something with the help of a bacon, egg or cheese on the bee with all the ways.
Rodríguez said he was not offended that the mill shop once took over the old place.
Moreover, the owners of Soup Sherry offered to make special soap for Verba, using coffee made in a cold way as an ingredient.
"I think we may agree to their proposal," Rodriguez said.
The permanent inhabitants of the Greenpoint of Polish origin also liked this caffeine.
One of these new clients moved the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place for him in the autumn to make his new neighbors feel desirable.
There are other benefits in the new place.
The local point for the sale of juices is planned to pour in bottles and sell coffee prepared in a cold way.
There is a likelihood that the caffeine will join the next building.
For many customers, it's enough that the new "Verb" will include their favorite candles in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a permanent client and shared that he was killed in a rage when they closed up.
When the coffee shop opened up in a new place, Whitt said that when he came in and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt like he was coming home.
"How long have I wanted to feel this aroma," he admitted.
Depressive eating of depression in "Plumbing Trapeza"
In March 1933, shortly after the President's resignation, Franklin Delano Roosevelt's seat was to be held in the Oval Cabinet.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved the fashion fairs of the Fifth Avenue, such as the Fua-gra and the meridian skull soup.
Its menu on that day was more modest: fried eggs in tomato sauce, potato powder, and dessert pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Zigelman.
Her husband, Andrew Cou, added, "This was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
The last book of Koua, Ragu in Chinese, was about the Chinese cuisine in America, and Zigelman told the story of life in a single apartment in the Lower East Side through food in his book House 97 on the street of Fruit Garden.
Their new joint work, "Silver Trapeza", which will be published on Tuesday by Harper, is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
In some way their own culinary solidarity, they met with the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny snack shop in the Flettaron Quarter, which has been working since 1929, the year of the Birže crash.
Zigelman, 54, ordered sleek cheese and butterbrokers with olive pieces, and Kou, 57, took the Indian, potato powder, and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roulette, the couple considered it an appropriate starting point for the discussion of food in the Depression era.
"Roulettes used a lot of demand," said Zigelman.
There was an Arabic roulette, a liver roulette, a drum roulette.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to grow.
Imagine that you ate as much peanuts as you needed for dinner.
Who's dead.
"He must have been lying in his stomach with a stone," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Women's groups prepared the farm for men and the freshly baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who fed hungry Europeans during the first world war. The "Silver Trapeza" describes how the country has managed to stop being a country of abundance.
"It was the time when food became a central, uneasy topic for Americans," Kou said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Similarly, there was a new budgetary framework: puzzles, such as roulettes and crevices, became the main food products; squeezing is a "pretty way to use the compound," Zigelman noted, because the spring could hide the unappetizing ingredients under a thick layer of sous.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the backbone of American food for many years, has become an economical luxury.
People have experienced strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary health.
By doing research for a book that includes recipes, Zigelman prepared a meal of that era: a sealed bow, painted with peanut butter.
"This supplement to the lunch table was not successful," Kou said.
Zigelman added, "This was very strange."
Archipelago oil is completely out of reach of the liver.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
As never before and ever since, housing specialists — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Housing Bureau, from 1923 to 1943 — managed the country’s food habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “broadcasters”, to accept challenges, and to transform the burrow into a kind of protracted spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
It's an old age of curious historical facts.
The Government's response to hungry citizens, for example, is particularly piqued by the position of President Herbert Guver in the spirit of "let the pies be eaten".
Publicly carrying a simple farm strip of the state of Iowa during his childhood, he was fed as a dim millionaire who became.
"He liked the continental kitchen, for example, fish with a sour sauce," Kou said.
He was practically in a golden table, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically out of reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to give an example of his own stomach.
As noted in the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired an economy that was totally not interested in taste, and this led to the White House "not only using the most unsolicited food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly prepared."
Many of the culinary receptions of the times of the Depression were forgotten as soon as the country again stood on its feet.
Their heritage is our constant focus on calories and nutrients, says Zigelman, and how science has been used in food preparation.
Spouses say that at the time of writing the book, they better understood the eating habits of Zigelman’s mother — that she could not expel food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of being rude to food," Kou said.
Siegelman remembers, "She poisoned people in a full series."
There was one unpleasant case with propitulants.
When the tarels in Eisenberg's were released, they got a dessert with Kou, which they prepared at home: a dessert made of black and white, which President Roosevelt went to lunch.
"It's called a black-headed muss," said Zigelman, adding that it was widely accepted to give the modest recipe a brothel.
There was not only a bluish, a little bit of pain, sugar, water, and cover.
Everyone was reluctant to load a bed in a narrow, brown, lipid.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
He asked for extras twice.
With the voice of a trusted budgeter, he said to his wife, "There wouldn't be any problem with the black-brown Greek nuts here."
The arrest of the figures on the mass dragon in the Havana Palace extended until 14 November
By 14 November, the Court of First Instance had detained the figures on the mass drama in Havana, meeting the relevant request for investigation.
In the case of the accused, 14 persons are executed.
It is recalled that on 14 May, a massive battle took place at the Havana Basilica of several hundred people leaving Central Asia and the North Caucasus, using weapons that killed three people.
The former head of the cemetery, Yuri Chabueva and the lawyer, the founder of the public organization Health Nation, Alexander Bocharnik, was charged with murder.
The issue of the second pension index for 2016 can be resolved within the next two or three weeks.
On 12 August, the Vice-Chairman of the Government of RF Olga Golodec reported on the visit to the region of Bryan.
We have specific parameters that need to be increased to stimulate the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
The economists are now undermining the results of the mid-year, and we will finish this work in the next two or three weeks," says the Hunger Interfax.
Commenting on the proposed chapter of the Centre for Strategic Development by Alexei Cudrin, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the topic was not addressed in the cab.
At the end of July, it became known that the Government had agreed on the position on the full pension payment index in 2017.
The stone and the Grigoryan went to the finals of the small-calibre shootings.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamenski and Kirill Grigoriyan went to the finals of the small-calibre shootings from the Olympics in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamensky has taken 629 points and has taken the first place - this is a new Olympic record of qualifications.
Cyril Grigoriyan became the second - 628.9 was.
There were eight best athletes in the finals.
The stone is a world record in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition Fethollah Gulen requires an international investigation into the circumstances of a coup attempt in Turkey.
"I require the independent international commission to carry out an investigation into the attempt to convert the State," quoted the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition also stated that "if any of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gullen refused to participate in the coup, stressing that his organization had never claimed political power.
The Istanbul Court had previously arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen.
Recall that a military coup attempt took place in Turkey at night from 15 to 16 July.
Gilead companies offset the costs of legal services during a hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to reimbursement of the costs of legal services it has incurred in connection with the difficulty of a hepatitis patent with a Merck & Co Inc drug manufacturer, the Federal District Judge has decided.
In June, Gilead was released from payment of $200 million in damages for the violation of two Merck patents related to Gilead medicines, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the US judge detected some violations by Merck, including a lie under oath and other non-ethical actions.
In court on Thursday, the U.S. Federal District Court judge, Beth Lebson Freeman, said that Gilead had the right to reimburse the costs incurred during the dispute.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 per cent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck were brought before each other in court, declaring their rights to laboratory work based on sophosbuvir, an active ingredient in Gilead medicine.
Armed forces established with the support of the United States claim to have taken over full control of Manbij in the Islamic State
The armed forces, established with the support of the United States, took full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last remnants of the Islamic State soldiers left, reported the group on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now cleaning the city after the remaining group of fighters who have been hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages who were detained by the fighters, told Reuters Sharfan Darvis of the Manbij military council's union with the SDS.
"The state is now fully under our control, but we are carrying out clean-up operations," he told the Reuters agency.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of federal tax
Hillary Clinton announced his 2015 tax returns on Friday, which showed that the candidate for the president of the Democratic Party and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in charity contributions, mainly at the Clinton Foundation, the former President Bill Clinton received approximately $5.3 million in fees for speeches, and the former Secretary of State expressed revenue of $3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her stay in the State Department.
The potential vice president Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane from Virginia, along with his wife, Anna Holton, issued ten-year tax returns.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"The Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine continue to establish a standard of financial transparency," said Clinton Palmmieri, a pre-election advisor.
In total contradiction, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and violates his past pledges to publish his tax returns.
It is a common case for candidates in the U.S. presidents to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them to do so.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called the verification of the Public Tax Service as a reason for his refusal to publish his tax declarations.
"Your move," wrote Twitter's pre-election advisor Clinton Jan Sams, referring to the declaration of a candidate from a democratic party.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trampa Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow the Trampo to issue them until the checks were completed.
Critics of Trump, including a candidate from the presidents of the Republican Party in 2012, Mitta Romni and other members of the Republicans, said that his refusal raised questions about his status, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other links, including with Russia.
Clinton took this issue and released an online video on Friday, which focused on issuing Republicans who convinced Trump to report tax.
On Thursday, she raised this issue during the Michigan economy.
"He refuses to do what everyone has done without exception to the president for ten years: announce his tax returns," she said to the assembled.
The Politico newspaper reported that Trump had paid no or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and the business suspect of the New York Times on Friday quoted many tax lawyers and accountants who believed that things might still exist.
Federal tax rates have become the subject of a dispute in the presidential elections.
Clinton supported a rule called the billionaire, Investor Warren Buffett, which would guarantee that people who received more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also under IRS scrutiny, and that Trump was afraid not of a tax collection agency but of voters.
The Clinton pre-election headquarters issued tax declarations until 2007.
Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid a federal average tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective aggregate tax rate of approximately 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration for 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost savings fund, and Clinton reported dividends and capital revenues of $109,000.

Chili powder and fireworks improve the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmental struggles in Tanzania have used a non-traditional way to prevent elephants from landing in human settlements, leaving reservoirs filled with dust of chili.
The method was effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came to mind a few years ago, with the American Committee on Nature Protection, took up its promotion by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step way of protecting their homes and crops, without causing animal injury.
Many used a copy to protect themselves.
On Friday will be the World Day of elephants dedicated to the protection of animals.
"Since we have invented a set of tools ..., we have seen a change in the relations within these communities, which makes them much more confident that they will not be able to leave elephants on their fields without causing elephants harm," Honeyguide Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps are to burn the faecal in front of a broken border with an elephant and to give signals through a horn.
If he couldn't escape, they'd throw away the so-called shadow chili.
The powder of chili, mixed with soil, is placed with the pump in the reservoir, and its end is bent, and only the phyll remains outside.
When the containers are incinerated, they melt with a grotto, evaporating a small powder powder of the air in the air.
One dune is usually enough to extend the elephant to the other.
The ultimate measure is the launch device that shoots the Roman candles into the air by producing a loud, bright explosion.
To date, 32 Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey, who left the country after the coup attempt in July this year.
Such data led Turkey's head Mevlut Chavuschoglu to engage with local journalists.
At the first stage, we withdrew 208 staff diplomats to continue working in the centre.
32 of them have not returned without objective reasons and explanation," said the head of the Turkish foreign policy authority.
Remember, in July Turkey, a coup attempt was made.
The authorities officially stated that the coup had failed, and reported that more than six thousand people had been detained, including military high and middle-ranking.
As a result of the attempted coup, 290 people were killed, according to the media of Turkey.
The Jewish director firmly criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel's telephone code for "asking" Arabs – reported channel RT News
The French director of Jewish origin opened up a scandal in the media, finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not have an Israeli telephone code, and the officials referred to "demands" by Arab clients.
Claude Lanzman, author of the Holocaust documentary Shoa, expressed his discontent with the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lansman hotel, he tried to find Israel in the list of telephone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, had not been mentioned among States where to call directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel was excluded and eliminated?
He wrote Lanceman.
In exchange for Kempinski Bristol, it provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In seeking an explanation, the director raised the issue at the level of the hotel administration.
The answer he received there, according to Lanzman, was "shocked him."
Clark Hotel said that the measure was "a surprising solution to Kempinski's network management."
The reason behind this step has led to even greater anger on the part of the director.
"Most of our Arab guests, and they demanded that Israel's code be removed," said Lanzman, who served at the hotel.
The Israeli Ambassador James Hadas-Handelsman called the case "a terrible loss," reports the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's really a terrible sight.
What happened in Germany, and that's what happened in this network of hostages, is even worse.
There's no need to explain.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," the officer said.
The incident caused a slight resonance on the Internet; it was called a scandal.
Some have claimed that the Kempinski Hotel was simply "going on" with the alleged requirements of Arab customers.
"We would be ashamed," another post said, stating that the hotel located on the famous Kurfurstendamm street is close to the icon.
The hotel itself hurried to cancel any charges, calling them "inadvertently" and "excusing" in front of Lanceman," reports Der Spiegel newspaper.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel in the fast-track list," quoted the representative of the Kempinski Hotel Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and cutting bullets against Protestant Brazilian students
The students met with the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they met to protest against government reform of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and cutting bullets against the protestors.
The riots began when police officers tried to drive the students away, which resulted in the police using cutting bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their concern about plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of San Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redeployed to save money.
Some participants in the protest could be seen writing on the graffiti walls against the temporary Acting President Michael Temer.
The last protest took place only a few days after the protest media came to the streets to support the removal of President Dilmu Rusef when the senate of the country voted in favour of her impression.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71%, reporting the RT Business portal
With severe sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, according to Ambassador Levan Jagaryan of Russia in Iran.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there has been an increase in the interest of Russian firms in the conduct of business in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing relations with Iran and new firms are ready to gain market access.
Of course, further expansion of trade is a key priority for bilateral cooperation with Iran," Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, traffic between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
The increase in trade has been achieved through the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the Ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that this year, Russia will visit a record number of Iranian tourists.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission to Iran issued some 35,000 visas, mainly to Iranian tourists.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered top-20 countries by number of tourists visiting Russia.
You can say with certainty that last year's record of the number of Iranian tourists who visited Russia will be beaten," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the city of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yez, where memories of ancient Persian civilization remain in good condition," he said.
The State continues to turn its traps into a defence-industrial complex.
The "systematic non-execution" of the commissions of the director of the Almaz-Antei Consortium, the "offset" and the "loss of confidence" were the reason for the dismissal.
The leader of NGOs has been appointed Gennadius Benderski for the next three years.
Disengagement information appeared only on Thursday night and did not produce a broad media resonance.
What would explain such a silence in the context of the large-scale rearming of the army?
It is likely that the RF leadership does not wish to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This is repeatedly confirmed by the fact that a defence-industrial complex (OPC) has many problems and the State does not want to attract greater attention from society.
The removal of Necorodov is certainly an important event in terms of ordering in the industry.
Almaz NGOs are the main business of the concert, which specializes in the production of marine and ground-based missile complexes.
Almaz is currently working on the establishment of the Polyment Redute and Morpheus CFCs, which are planned to be installed on new beds, frigates, esminians and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia Portal Dmitry Cornev believes that the release of the Non-Scoodov is due to a break in time for the projects.
This is the most logical version.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007, and the construction was expected in 2013.
"Poliment Redout" must be the main WFP system on the new WFP ships.
According to the information I receive, for several years no successful test has been carried out.
The truth is, as far as I can judge, there's no clear fault of the Almas," Cornev said.
The expert is afraid that a delay in the operation may also occur with the C-500 CFC.
The work on the project has not yet been completed, but the first complexes must enter the military in 2016.
In Minowan, they assure that “the work is being done in a planned manner and will all be completed within a specified time frame”, although in 2014, the department recognized that there were problems with the development of the P-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has been leading the Almaz since 2011.
Cornev noted that the project deadlines could be both a cause and a cause of dismissal.
In his view, it has become extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in OPC and business management plans.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and large money, as you know, loves silence.
The director of defence companies usually resigns from his/her position, under the agreement agreement of the parties, or is transferred to another work.
In this case, the removal took place in public, even though it did not receive a resonance.
This suggests that the Almaza leader was perhaps a sharp figure and opposed to the "disorders" on the top.
In all likelihood, the State no longer intends to act in such a manner.
It will remove those who prefer to dispute with Mino-Defend and do not fulfil the tasks assigned to them by shareholders.
At the same time, the RF's leadership seeks to punish the alleged managers (the Starship Machines).
Improved attention is given to the issues of the sector by the President himself.
Vladimir Putin chaired the Military Industrial Commission and held periodic rearm meetings.
The Kremlin protects a number of OPC managers, seeking to have a loyal member of directors who will perform the above-mentioned tasks.
This is a far-reaching policy, but there are no State instruments in the face of corruption and the lack of normal competition in the OPC.
The situation in defence, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical environment encourages the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces in as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "cleaning" of managers in the OPC, the RF leadership is taking very successful steps to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.
The staff of the army acquired a new quality with the entry into office of Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.
It's hard to believe that the President has taken up a famous saying, "You want peace to prepare for war."
During the cold war, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which had secured the influence of Moscow on the continent.
With all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, she worked very well.
The lack of war on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East have been evidenced.
In the cold war, the “winners” trade has eventually been strengthened by international terrorism.
After a series of attacks in Europe and the United States in the "civilized world", there is no peaceful corner left.
Despite the overall poverty, the West refuses to speak to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such circumstances, our country's only allies remain the fleet and the army.
Strengthening the military will enable Moscow to defend national interests more effectively and to move to new world policies.
Scotland's Kallum Skinner is fighting on the finish line, resulting in British riding gold.
Shotlander Kallum Skinner wanted a triumph in a male commandoprint on the street in Rio last night, which resulted in the British commando trio protecting its title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old native of Glasgo was the strongest friend of his Scottish friend Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the young man was proud of his history, wandering in the finish line to win the favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain declared the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoi declared the right to the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after they had finished modest sixths at the March World Championship on the three bikes in London, even though Hoi had finished his career since then.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of a specialist from Jamie Staff.
They did it the same way when the Hindus showed up.
The care of Hoa also created the void that Keian Emmadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was a man held by British coaches, seeing the potential in Scotland, which has now been realized.
Hindus, Kenny, and Hoi champions four years ago, and Skinner set up an Olympic record of qualifications, but the norm was passed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was right behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported it.
The shift in the strategy was a major part of the transformation, where Hindus went on a larger shift to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, to hold Skinner fast.
She watched from her seat as an invited BBC expert and took the view of Skinner, Kenny and Hendes when they entered the Pedestal.
The 23-year-old Skinner of Glasgo said, "This is a slow comparison."
I'm here to do everything possible and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and beat the world champions.
That was amazing.
There's no better way to win.
After the 2012 London triumph together with Kenny and Hoy, Hindus admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a failed start.
He later denied the comment, and there was no way to appeal by UK competitors.
There was no such issue this time in the greatest victory.
Hindus said, "I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags at the tribunal."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We played so many world-class races that winning the Olympics again was just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for the country that won seven out of 10 slots in both Beijing and London.
If it is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, then five more successful days await the hero.
In the form shown by Kenny, it is not beyond the opportunity to present, as he repeats Hoa, three Olympic gold medals won in one game.
This would allow us to see how Kenny, who was also born on March 23, when she was 12 years younger, is also born in British sport, which is also the day of the birth of Steve Redgray, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister.
It'd be like Hoa.
Next time, Kenny competes in a drink that starts today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old exit from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it right now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You're coming to win with your friends.
It's not easy to beat each other, if it's fair.
He said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he has to get a ride."
It was the only one for the medal day, but it was the next good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Berk and Owen Doll are the fastest four-mile chase race.
They ended up at 3:51,943.
The world record set for winning gold in London 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and final (10:42 evening) will take place today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will be exactly the focus.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, before the qualifying train when officers demanded him to measure his weight.
In the women ' s event, which is being resumed and completed tomorrow, Laura Troott, Joanna Roussel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavi have improved the world record, showing the time of 4:13,260.
The British team has come to the conclusion that it is up to the potential team of bikers to take possession of the mid-term Olympic Games and earn a piece of medals.
After indeed the exceptional demonstrations of complete superiority in Beijing and London, expectations were weakened in the gradual preparation for Rio.
There were dramas in the second, not least, of the departure from the position of technical director Shane Satton in April because of the charges of sexism and harassment, and of major figures such as Hoi and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the race of the first evening on the wheel, it seems that the legendary glory of Britain now appears to be reaching peaks at the right time, perhaps once again.
Future of the Portland Metallurgical Plant under threat due to the breakdown of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland aluminium plant in Victoria, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is threatened by the fact that the electricity company that supplies the plant, according to one of the owners of the plant, is going to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This step is the result of a decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian Government not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed grant for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be under threat at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — can occur in the risk zone as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the metallurgical plant in Point Henry, leading to the closure of the power plant in England last year.
Alcoa's Portland Metallurgical Plant is losing money and risking closure.
These actions were the result of reflections on the future of the factory, which has been going on for several years, primarily because of the strong positions of the Australian dollar and later because of the price of the production of the plant.
The AGL company, which supplies large aluminium power plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrob Walli, reported that it expects other three owners to also take steps to break the treaty.
The controlling share of the plant belongs to the joint short-term company Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp have smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to work, that is, the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop," she said.
According to AGL, the contracts mentioned are so-called ‘hewed contracts’ that were to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month separation period, so they actually end in 2017.
“Therefore, AGL still expects these contracts to bring their share of revenue in the financial year 2017,” the electricity company said.
Any potential impact on AGL's income from the financial year 2018 to date is limited to the strong future market for optimal electricity prices.
The company AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its account for $187 million in terms of “future disbursement”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to manage a metallurgical plant or to provide electricity to a metallurgical plant”.
The US company stated that in 2010 it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was due to enter into force in November of this year, but it still had to explain why it had broken the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland metallurgical plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle because of the adverse economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, the Chief of Operations of AGL Steven Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year, and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electricity].
For us, as for the manufacturer, it will be bad," he said.
Not just the Kardashian reality star, Kendall on the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, a 20-year-old model and the fourth daughter of Clan Kardashian-Jenner, mother-in-law Chris, appeared on the led September cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who was a brand of Estee Lauder and who had described the fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, reported the news in his Instagram account on Thursday.
"When I was in the room with my loved ones, I looked at this bet and cried," wrote Kendall.
The news of the bet was accompanied by a strange (or simply in the spirit of the Cardassian Family?), prepared video reality, in which the entire family of Cardassian-Jenner (debosher Rob and Caitlin, also joined by the most popular show-business uncle, producer of the Cardassian Family, Ryan Sikrest), forgot about the sister's appearance on the bet, and at the end of the classic turn: they planned a party-surprise.
It's a standard subject line for almost all children's television shows dedicated to birthdays (the Secret says, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the multi-faceted rabbit from the program on 8 a.m.), but Chris needed this glory to be achieved by other girls.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have no doubt entered the new era of the Kardashian show.
She left her older sister Kendall Kim on the cover of Vogue earlier (she showed up with her husband Kanha West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine was a achievement on her own.
September issue is the most sold Vogue issue per year.
It is more like a gift edition than a fashion magazine, and it attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to Fasionista portal estimates, 615 pages from last year's 832-page issue contained advertisements).
News of the star’s siege is expected with such impatience that in the last two years, photographs of the magazine have been transmitted to the official ad.
Among the previous women who had fallen into siege were Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has, of course, been more "familiarities working in models" than "familiar models".
The winner of the Oscar Prize and the character of the Dior Jennifer Lawrence brand was presented on the bet in 2013, a year after Lady Gage was awarded the award.
But even in the unlikely case, if Jenner, which magazine described as the "extensive model" of his generation, falls into the first category, she's in a bad company.
These celebrities are not family members of known people, reality-show stars or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (though Jenner falls into all these categories).
These are really talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
For Baionse, who appeared on last year's bet, this year was one of the most successful careers for the Lemonade album.
Of course, it's not all good luck, Jenner.
The situation in the world of fashion, because of her last TV reality star, has always had to be a joke.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the battles of the moment".
These moods were once again disturbed after the news of the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue bet.
But there's no point in cyclical dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September Vogue.
It is a supermodel in all sense of the word.
She's defiling Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you a ton cream from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling their photos to you in their own apps available on payroll.
She sells her own photographs of Cindy Crawford's daughter in Love magazine.
And at free time, maybe still seeing her sister Cortney and her children, she's participating in a reality show on TV.
Public legal centres refuse to serve 160,000 people per year
Each year more than 160,000 least-protected representatives of the population refuse to serve in public legal centres, as this sector is preparing for an impact that will further reduce the funding for and so on.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people who are unable to combat unfair property deprivation, and so on — have already been denied, seeking free legal assistance and representation.
Public legal services, which are already outside the scope, are preparing for further reductions.
Since June next year, these legal centres should lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of the Public Legal Centres of Queensland, James Farrell, said that according to the latest census of the National Association of Public Legal Centres, thousands of people have been denied a year.
Farrell said that if the federal government decision was not cancelled, the situation would only worsen.
"The public legal centres in Queensland are constantly getting insufficient funding: this means that thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who are forced out of a relationship, people with unmanageable and devastating debts, families who are through divorce, unjustly dismissed workers — all of these people have legal problems, and this account shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will reduce funding by 30 per cent since June 2017, which means that thousands of less protected people in Queensland will have to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis to cancel these reductions immediately so that people can get the help they need when they face legal problems.
Last year, the Government has fulfilled its obligation to raise funding for free legal aid to the country's average.
Now is the time to draw attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients, and the Government of Palaczuk's time to engage in this important work.
Donald Trump's pre-election headquarters was brought before the court after the officer allegedly threatened with a gun
According to New York reports, Donald Trump's pre-election headquarters was brought to court: it is claimed that the headquarters did not do anything after the announcement that his Operational Director in North Carolina threatened the staff member when they were driving to the jeep in February.
The incident was described in a court case brought on Wednesday to the court of the state in Charlotte Vincent Bordini, a former programmable trainer at the pre-election headquarters of the state.
Bordini said he'd waited a few months to solve the problem internally, but he realized that it wouldn't happen.
Director Earl Phillip "drawed the gun, placed his right index finger on the hook and put a doll on Vincent's knee," says Bordini in a complaint.
Upon appeal to the local and regional pre-election headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more persons had become participants in similar incidents with Phillip, it was accepted.
"We don't have to shoot guns to hurt," Bordini said in a complaint.
The request took place only two days after the president of the Republican Party had made a furor, he told the North Carolina audiences that "the people of the Second Amendment" — known as the owners of weapons and their lovers — could begin to act if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and could choose judges.
The Trompa pre-election team said that the media had removed his words from the context and that he had not spoken in support of violence.
In his complaint Bordini called for compensation from the pre-election headquarters for non-bride control, and from Phillip, for the threat of physical violence, abuse of action and moral damage.
The representative of the Trump Hope Hicks is slowing down in response to the request to comment.
Trying to talk to Phillip was not successful.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Philip had recently left the pre-election headquarters.
In response to the call to his consulting firm, the Innovation Advisory Services, no one called quickly.
The candidate from the Republican Party, Donald Trump, conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Mecklenburg District Court (Charlott).
Britain must put the spirit of the Olympics in the right order and expand the Hytro
It will also bring refreshment and prosperity not only in our present human settlements and in general throughout London but throughout the country.
As I believe it was the huge advantage of Hytro, just as it was with London in 2012, where we have made every effort to benefit our people and regions from the game.
The Olympic Games have been of great benefit to Stratford and East End.
And we're going to do that again, creating opportunities for locals and companies next to Hytro.
We will create 10,000 new traineeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London in 2012, those who think that the task of expanding the Hytro will be too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics, and that we would be in a difficult situation on the world stage.
Skeptics made mistakes in 2012 and will prove them wrong about Hytro.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Hytro answers any question about him.
Like the Olympic Games Hytrou, it is an infrastructure project for most people, not just for the narrow circle.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a wonderful team in Hytro, which has implemented a programme of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment in time and within the budget, from T5, which is chosen by the best five-year airport terminal, to T2, built in the middle of the two most employed in the world.
They are now ready to provide the third flight crew, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for Britain, and I am sure that the expansion of Hytro would also be.
It is time for us to put the Olympic spirit in the right direction and to expand the Hitroh by providing our trade future and by creating the legacy of skills and employment that Britain will be able to boast about.

Adblock Plus, Facebook plays in the "cat-mooch" about blocking advertising
For companies that earn money on the Internet, attempting to turn off software to block advertising is a game in the "bitch" game, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, a few days after Facebook announced that it was going to block the advertising blockers on their desktop version, Adblock Plus posted a blog that users could update their filters in the program to block the advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site is changing the edge of its advertising to make it more difficult for the blockers to identify which parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now claims he was able to bypass a new code.
In his blog post, the representative Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "a sort of mutual struggle between the community of blockers with an open source code and those who are trying to bypass it is continuing from the moment the ad block is invented", and that Facebook might present its own decision in the near future.
The fact that the world's largest social network has entered the struggle is a clear sign of how big a problem the industry has become.
Around 200 million people worldwide use advertising blockers, according to the last year's study Pagefair and Adobe; almost four times the number of those using such software in 2013.
In view of 1.3 billion daily active users entering Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising is now 84 per cent of Facebook's revenue from advertising.
However, the company will follow the advertising blockers on the desktop, as mobile advertising blockers are ineffective in the Facebook mobile applications for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
However, advertising in the desktop version is a sufficient income to make Facebook think of such a beneficial investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its "ad preferences" tool to give people more control over how advertising is being targeted.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that new Adblock filters are causing concern, as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem," said a Facebook representative in an official e-mail.
Advertising blockers are a cruel tool, so instead we have focused on creating tools such as Advertising Preferences to hand over management to people.
The woman was transferred to the Swiss highway at the episode of apparent suicide
The victim lay on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after the woman moved several vehicles to the highway early in the morning in an apparent attempt to kill herself.
The incident occurred on A1 near Morge in the canton immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the darkness "in despair" and was hit by several vehicles, reported to the police in a statement.
It seems that trying to kill himself, the victim, a Swiss woman 49 years old, hit several vehicles, including a truck.
She died in the place.
Several involved drivers have already been questioned, but the identity of some has not yet been established, reported by the police who calls them and someone else who has witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case, a “logical” step in such a situation, was initiated, lawyer Gile Hoffsetter Le Tribune de Geneve said.
However, it remains to be ascertained whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a blow?
That's what the prosecutor needs to determine," Hoffsetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held accountable.
In each case — both of which involve a person in the darkness on the road — the judgment was given that drivers cannot expect a random meeting with a pedestrian on the road in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of the death of the unwarranted, after she struck and killed a man lying on A1 next to Payern at night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, heard the court.
The court found that a woman police officer, who responded to the extreme challenge, managed the vehicle in a manner that was justified and that the existence of a person on the road was “a perfectly exceptional and unpredictable situation”, said the judge.
Anyone who has information about the incident on Thursday next to Morge should call the police for 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have once been inhabited, according to the estimates of the new NASA climate model.
The students from the Warsaw Institute of Space Studies have developed a model for the previous Venus study, using instruments and algorithms similar to those used by climateologists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have a hot, waterless surface and an atmosphere that was recharged with carbon dioxide, ever having conditions similar to that of the earth.
The scholars had previously assumed that the low speed of Venus’s rotation was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the last modeling suggests that Venus could probably have a dispersal atmosphere similar to that of the earth, and still be back slowly.
The model also considered the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than on Earth, but at one time there was enough water and sufficient geographical variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent thick.
"According to the GISS model, the slow driving of Venus causes its daily side to the sun for almost two months at a time," explained GISS Anthony Del Henio in a press release.
It warms the surface of the planet and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as a sunscreen protecting the surface of the planet from a substantial part of solar heat.
The result is average climate temperatures, which are, in fact, a few degrees colder than we are today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development that was previously predicted by planet study experts.
Although Venus may once have been inhabited, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet emissions over a number of billions of years.
Her oceans disappeared, and her water pair was burned with ultraviolet radiation.
When her hydrogen flew, there was only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect — Venus, which we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy leaves the Avalanche team coach post
Patrick Roy left the post of coach and vice-president of the hockey activities Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, referring to the lack of influence during the decision-making process in the team.
The Executive Vice-President/Chief Commander of the Colorado Command Joe Sakik confirmed the news and noted that the club was about to start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have performed my duties as chief coach and vice-president of Colorado Avalanche's hockey activities with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During the summer, I spent a lot of time thinking about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needed and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve that goal, the vision of the coach and vice-president of hockey should be perfectly consistent with the vision of the organization.
It should also have the right to vote in taking decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patric told me about his decision today," Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the best league coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He has brought the club to 112 points and victory in the Central Division, but Colorado has been devastated by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and has been playing playoffs for the past two years.
The Avalanche team announced an assessment of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and left the Wild team five points in the fight for a second easy trip to the Western Conference.
A returnman from the Hall of Slavs, Roy won four Cube Stanleys — two with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oilmen resume negotiations and halt the strike
The oil strikes in the North Sea have been suspended, and all the parties to the discussion are beginning a new round of negotiations, the leading representatives of the parties reported.
The attacks against the oil service company Wood Group were organized on platforms in the North Sea under the direction of the Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and United and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve current disputes," the joint statement states.
We will hold several full-day meetings for the next few weeks, starting at the beginning of the next week, to look at problems in a fresh light.
The trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was over 25 years old, was directed against potential wage reductions of up to 30 per cent.
This year, the Wood Group reduced the rates paid to contract staff working in the North Sea by about 9 per cent due to negative market tensions.
The company's interest reduction occurred after a 10% reduction in the rate for contract staff working on the coast in 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions will give it space necessary to overcome the market decline.
Shell, for its part, has reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil-gas activities in the countries by 10, as it rationalizes its activities as a result of its mega-combination with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the low prices for crude oil: the economic situation has deteriorated because of the decision to leave the European Union in June.
The Scottish member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the major labour conflicts that have arisen in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, was vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, yes and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for most, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion of new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared to the average value of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of driving stars in Pleiade's grave.
The last mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers collect the most complete directory of the speeds of the stars entering the Pleiades.
New data help astronomers to understand why the stars are spinning at different speeds and how the rotation periods are related to the formation of the planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Louis Riball, a scientific officer of the Centre for Infraracry Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Pleiades are buried in 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the grave are now only mature; they were born some 125 million years ago.
They're coming back as fast as they'll never be again.
At their peak speed, these adult stars emit large amounts of star wind.
As they travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds give them a braking effect on the stars.
As the star grows older, its speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of the rotation of each star, tracking the time between the appearance of known star feathers — such as the sun’s rays.
The new driving speed directory assumes that more mass stars are turning slower than less mass stars.
The fish compares the stars to the dancers: the larger the pirates make them slower than the smaller ones.
"In Ballet, we see that those who return slowly are usually more massive, while those who return faster are usually very light stars," said Ribal.
As Pleiade's excavation is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of stars to speeds of rotation.
"The Pleiades' constellation provides a starting point for the theoretical models of driving stars, both younger and older," said Ribal.
We want to know more about where and why the stars slow down their speed and hang their dance shoes on the iron.
Fish and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the speeds of Pleiade's driving in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
A study related to the activities of a group of detainees in Crimea of Ukrainian diversants is conducted by two agencies, writes "Commersant".
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of diversions in Crimea.
As previously reported, the Ukrainian resident Energodar Evgenie Panov agreed to cooperate with the consequences.
According to him, he considered the Titan chemical plant in Armenia, the Feodosia oil base, the Kerchen paramilitary, the gas pipeline, and one of the military airports.
The law enforcement authorities believe that the detention has not been carried out far from all the divisions of the dissidents.
This, in particular, was the basis for arresting suspects in the Kiev Court of Simferopol, notes the publication.
Stanislav Cerchesov became the main coach of the Russian football team
At the meeting, a decision was taken by the Russian football team to appoint as the main coach of the Russian football team Stanislav Cerchesov.
The contract will be awarded for two years before the end of CM-2018.
On 11 August, he appointed the chief coach of the Russian football team Stanislav Cerchesov.
This is a well-known footballer who played in Moscow's Spartacus in the position of a doorman, as well as a coach with solid experience as a teacher of Russian teams such as Spartacus, the Sochi Women's, the Terek, the Hamcar, the Dinamo, and the Warsaw League, who became the winner of the national championship and the country's Cup.
It is reported that the contract with Churchess will be signed as soon as possible and calculated for two years.
Thus, it is his duty to prepare for the 2018 World Championship.
It is known that Miroslav Romaštenko, Gintaras Stauče, Vladimir Panic will enter his training station.
There is information that the salary of the entire training staff will be 2.6 billion euros a year.
According to the media, the leadership of the RFS has set before Stanislav Church's goal to bring Russia to semi-finals and to win medals.
As the coach himself said, he considered the establishment of a competitive environment in the team as a priority and was going to give football players an opportunity to show up.
Also, according to Churchess, he is pleased that the election fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Churchess will be held by the Russian assembly in Antalya on 31 August, which will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
In the past, Leonid Slucky, who combined him with a coach at the CSCA, was the leading coach of the Russian football team.
He declared his resignation after the Russian national team's Euro-2016 speech in France.
However, he took responsibility for the poor result of the collection.
The greed between Angola and the South has greatly affected Namibia during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, after the independence of South Africa in 1990, that country, with a population of 2.4 million, has achieved tremendous success, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success is the Government ' s emphasis on education.
While people in developed countries view free primary and secondary education as their own understanding, many poor countries in secondary and even primary schools require a tuition fee.
In addition, Governments are often advised to introduce fees for “cost-reimbursement” training.
However, primary school education in Namibia is free of charge.
Moreover, since 2015 secondary education has become free.
The country ' s authorities are also active in other important areas.
The efforts to destroy malaria have reduced the number of annual cases of disease by 97 per cent over the past ten years.
Despite the international trend of growth in inequality, Namibia is declining.
Compared with the 1993 rate of Gini, which is the standard indicator of income inequality, 15 points have fallen.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
Poverty decreased from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) has also decreased from nearly 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest rate of freedom of speech in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country has greatly surpassed the United States and other rich States.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the Index of Corruption, which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now that prices for raw materials are falling, Namibia is able to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the debt ratio to GDP is around 25 per cent, which is less than 1/3 in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The level of unemployment, at least in traditional evaluation methods, remains sufficiently high, almost 28 per cent.
And like other countries in the region, the high incidence of HIV/AIDS in Namibia is nearly 17 per cent of the population.
According to the World Bank, Namibia is among the countries with higher average income, but the authorities insist that their State is indeed a developing country.
Namibia, of course, faces some of the difficulties faced by poorly developed economies.
The State must develop a very large and dry country with a small population.
In the territory of the country, isolated breeds of hunter-gatherers live in deserts, which must otherwise be integrated into modern society without losing their identity.
The integration of people who had been on the world economy for four centuries was a challenge for any country.
It is even more difficult for Namibia: like any other country in the world, it faces the consequences of climate change.
However, Namibia did not intend to give up, and the country was facing its challenges.
Almost immediately after the independence of the authorities, the government was involved in the creation of a diversified economy and a unified society.
It is remarkable that competing political factions have gathered together to work for common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides financial services not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of medical visitors to the northern regions of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia spoke of building a wall that would separate the country from poor and corrupt neighbors.
Namibians understood that the neighbours did not choose, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional medical projects, to encourage investment and to exchange students.
In addition, the Namibian Government has rightly held that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, helping to enrich a few from many.
The authorities understand that Namibia ' s natural wealth income needs to be invested in infrastructure and productive capacity.
They are also aware that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum proceeds from the sale of the country's resources, and review investment laws and profit contracts to ensure that this is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, so strong support by the Government for freedom of speech is so important.
As the Head of State of The Hague Gaingob noted, the media often say that he does not like it.
But after fighting for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms obtained, the President said.
Not all Namibia ' s key resources are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, are renewables, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists visit the country every year.
Namibia shows that even those countries that are beginning to face serious deficiencies -- racism, colonial construction, inequality and low levels of development -- can get on the way to common prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and reflection.
Many have heard of the Golden Varna, the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 years before our era).
This was the most massive archaeological sensation in the 1970s: in Bulgaria, a fantastic number of gold artifacts, more than three thousand total weights of 6 kilograms, were discovered in the excavations of Varnen Necropolis.
Only one burial, known as Mogila No. 43, was extracted from 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the earliest gold of the world can soon be seen as a bus found by archaeologists in July of this year.
Again in Bulgaria, in a prehistoric settlement, known as the Tel Eunaki.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tel Yunac are located far from the sea, near the village of Yunac of the Pazardjisk region.
Busin is a gold band turned into a ring.
Javor Bajjaev, the digger at Tele Yunaci, dated the discovery 4600 years before our era and stated that she was the oldest of Varna's gold for at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna are dated about the same period from 4600 to 4200 B.C.E.
There are currently no technologies to accurately date the metal.
How, then, can we be sure that gold is the oldest?
Professor Bajjiev obviously knows more than he told the Reuters agency: "I am absolutely sure that the gold of the Greeks is the gold of Varna."
It's a discovery of extraordinary importance: it's a tiny object, but it's big enough to take a nice place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Bajjiev, the researchers reported that soon the metal composition was being analysed, as well as re-examined the archeological layer where a gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bus as accurately as possible.
The site also explains a lot.
Tell the Greeks is a famous settlement even if you have never heard of it.
Tel Yunaki is currently considered the oldest "city" of Europe.
Tel was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) for 7 millenniums before our era.
Over the centuries, metal processing in this region has developed rapidly, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a fully valued industry.
The family history of this archaeological community has a special title: the Balkan-Carpathian Metallurgical Province.
In the five thousand years before our era around the metal processing centers, settlements of the city type began to emerge.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of them, Tel Yunaki may be the oldest since the artifacts of 4900 were found here before our era.
I would call Tel Yunaki a prototype of the modern city, although it's a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This place is the older Shomer for a thousand years," says Bajujev, referring to the generally accepted view that urban culture was born in southern Mesopotamia, a modern Iraq.
There were first cities in the ordinary sense of the word.
The excavations of Tel Yunaki have been taking place since 1976.
At that time, archaeologists dug up almost 12 hectares, about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall were found, which once reached three feet [3 m] in height.
From houses and masters, there was little left, but archaeologists made a clear distinction between streets, public buildings, urban flats, business centres and residential districts.
The Tel Eunatics often call the Bird City: there were dozens of clay figures found here.
All birds are represented in a state of peace, from which there was a assumption that they were not decorative objects but a local cult object.
"The Bird City" was destroyed about 4100 years before our era, perhaps by the Indo-European tribes from the north-east.
There were no cities in the carriages, so there were horses and weapons.
The three-metre walls have not stopped them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of a brutal war: remains of elders, women and children were found inside the houses with wounds inflicted by gunshots.
New findings and new facts appear annually, changing the usual perceptions of the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly speaking, not about individual cultures, but about the “lost” first civilization of Europe, born in the Balkans.
The search for this civilization has become a powerful incentive for Varna's gold, found relatively recently, in 1972.
It makes sense that Varna's golden rose was to have something ahead of him - something like a tiny golden bush set up in the Yonaki Tell.
In Porsche artificially old model 911 Targa
It has been officially stated that the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is being prepared by manual company specialists working with serial machines.
The "Retro-Luk" is, for example, in the special color of Etna Blue, which was designed in 1960 for Porsche 356B models, in this color, even the logo of the model.
In addition, the market has received a firm white chart along the board and a special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel drive, as well as some piece design details decorated with "white-gold".
The retro-reflector interior is less marked: it is largely different from the grey-blue shape range, new sheets with extended ranges of electrical regulation and separate black anodized steel with the unit logo.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a car cheque and a well-distributed album with photos of the production process.
The strong installation of Porsche Exclusive has not become an exclusive feature: the retro-trailer is fully compatible with the series.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine of 3,0 litres, developing 420 litres and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of 911 Targa 4S is capable of speeding up to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be issued with a limited circulation, but neither its volume nor the value of each specific athlete is reported.
Facebook and ad blockers unloaded the “arms race”
The recent implementation of Facebook technology, which prevented advertising from being hidden on the site of the site, has prompted decision makers to block the advertising for response.
In AdBlock Plus, they released a "anti-fighting", but Facebook plans to make it useless too soon.
So AdBlock Plus has announced its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
The members of the network noted that, in attempting to deceive a new "unblocked" advertising technology, AdBlock Plus's decision, along with commercial announcements, also blocked many regular posts from friends or pages.
On Facebook, they voiced regret over such an AdBlock Plus policy and promised to solve the problem soon.
As a source of techCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop will be ready for the next few hours.
Thus, interlockers and blockers have released their kind of “arms race”, trying to play with each other, who have suffered from the same side, have become users who have missed interesting recordings from friends or seen advertisements where they have not been used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of blocking advertising have recently caused heated disputes.
In Murmanska, the rapist will appear before the court · Evening Murmansk.
His case had already been investigated by the Russian Federation ' s Investigation Committee on the Murman Region.
The 54-year-old's indictment is very serious about committing violent acts of a sexual nature.
As a result, it was found that at the end of November 2015 the accused in the area of Paulva Street in Murmanska had committed sexual acts with violence against 20-year-old girls.
Penalties under that article provide for maximum imprisonment for up to six years.
Dongfeng brings Russian cross-countrymen Fengguang 370 and Rich New pickup - ruelem www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a popular representative of the Chinese car class, which combines the value of minivan and crosshairs.
Another alleged Russian prime minister is Pikap Rich New.
Many Western companies of Moscow International Auto salon this year have decided to ignore the fact that the Krokus Expo exhibition halls will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, the Dongfeng Motor, a strong front, has large Russian markets and plans to offer a number of interesting news to our car lovers in the near future.
One of them will be Dongfeng Fengguang 370, which sold in China at this spring price of 55,900 yuan (see below 550,000 yuan).
To the Russians, such a price hardly shines, yes, and the issue of supplies in our country is still under discussion.
In China, for example, Fengguang 370, as a result of the June sales, was able to reach 11th place in the list of the most sold minivans, although due to the high road education (175 mm) and the protective plastic cover on the lower perimeter of the body, it can be attributed to crossovers.
Crossween is built on the prefabricated platform of the latest Fengguang 360 model, with 370 of the same wheel base in 2725 mm, but the pieces are longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), more solid design, and more extensive equipment.
The salon is decorated with wooden planks, but the large vertical sensor screen "as in Tesla" on the central console was only on early exhibition copies of the cross-country, and the machines with "music" were sold easily.
Five of the seven landing sites are easily composed, forming a level load area of 1650 mm, a maximum of 1500 l.
The Fengguang 370 engine is equipped with only one - 1.5 litre petrol "atmosphere" power 115 B.C., meeting with the 5-degree mechanical transmission box.
With regard to the dynamic quality of the machine, the manufacturer is modest, and the saving budget of the owner promises an appetite level of 6.7 l/100 km.
Pikap Rich New is well-known Russians Nissan NP300 Navara of the invited generation, but with a popular Chinese design.
Despite the moral ageing, this model has still been used as a stable demand for the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unscrupulous “worker of horses”.
At the same price, Rich New is probably interested in Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become immeasurably expensive.
Rich News is equipped with two pick-up engines: petrol 2.4 liters (137 liters) or turbodiesel 2.5 liters (116 liters).
The transmission box is only a mechanic, the input is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a rigidly connected front.
The representation of the Chinese company will be announced in June at the Dongfeng stand and the new flagman seat A9, his Russian prime minister.
The Chinese market is becoming more and more like a miniature crossword puzzle, one of the latest news - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, Russian Lt. Dongfeng is composed of two models: S30 and H30 Cross.
Seven months later, the Chinese company’s dealers made 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax notices will cease to be sent by mail to the following website: www.zr.ru
The tax inspection changed the order in which the property tax notices were sent.
All Russian auto owners used the unchanging scheme: in summer and autumn, they received a ticket to pay the transport tax for the previous year.
However, many of them will not be expected this year.
The case is that the tax inspection has changed the order of notification of citizens without excessive noise.
Those who are registered in the Personal Tax Office on the official website of the log.ru will receive electronic notices.
In inspections, such Russians were automatically viewed as online users and removed from the standard, paper-based transmission.
All vehicle owners and real estate are affected by the news.
All others will continue to receive ordinary letters.
On the other hand, there is an opportunity to return to the old scheme for account holders on the site.
To this end, they will have to visit the tax office during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more comfortable.
The notification will appear in the "personal office" immediately after its completion, while the letter will go for a few days and may be lost.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet tax inspection service has exceeded 18 million, allowing the department to be seriously saved on mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection site is obviously not enough to inform citizens of the changed order.
Some could be registered in the “personal office” to obtain a one-time service and have long forgotten it.
These people are not expected to receive notices by mail, and they are not aware of all the consequences of non-payments.
Access to the Personal Tax Office is made in three ways: through an account of the gosuslugi.ru portal, by means of an electronic signature or the introduction of the log and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person at any tax inspection office (depending on the place of account).
We recall that transport tax should be paid by 1 December in the current year.
The notification was sent in July.
The Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, which aims to achieve a very high impact, is the thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not bother G-Power's masters, who took over the modification of Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its passion for BMW cars, but nothing human to its masters is foreign.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63-571-strong flying suit with an aerodynamic tank and a discharge of up to a hundred by 5.4 c?
With the "muscle" of the confused "gelic", the masters took advantage of the advantages that opened a 5.5 litre super-highway.
And that's the dynamics of running up to a hundred has improved to an indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying "kirpic" is capable of a 5.3 s.
However, the speed of the average speed is likely to be significantly better for him.
The speed ratio is alarmed: if standard G 63 does not travel more quickly than 210 km/h, the heavy-duty all-wheeler with a disabled electronic "coach" is capable of exceeding 250 km/h.
Other cars are almost different from their factory original, except for other wheels - 23 inch Hurricane RR 305/35 ZR 23.
The Lux office of Mercedes-Maybach announced a 6 m-long blow-up concept which will be presented in the Pebbl-Bitch Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the BMW i green sub-brand and will move its electric models under a separate trademark.
At least four environmental news reports are expected in the coming years.
