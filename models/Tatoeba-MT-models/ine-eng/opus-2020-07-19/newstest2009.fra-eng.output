At the end of the trade, the Prague Bascula Stock Exchange in the Negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ actions reach almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the trade, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed with the fall of the watch, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the drop is due to the drop of the stock on Wall Street.
The response of the market to the result of the vote of the House of American Representatives, which refused to adopt the Stabilisation Plan of the American financial sector, is also discernible in us.
Shots of actions in Asia
Asian scholarships won a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even if the indexes succeed in destroying part of the losses during the day.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index loses four percent during the trades, but later it eliminates some of the losses and reduces the decrease to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Index Enterprises following the move of the Chinese shares of Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8%, with the markets closed in Shanghai.
Sydney's stock was lost by more than five percent, but finally it was able to reduce losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 per cent.
"The hesitation of the rescue action in the USA will affect the financial markets of the world," observed Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong's monetary office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, that is, independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are the same as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal for support for the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would be at risk of being affected.
U.S. Action Blood Bath
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the draft support for the financial system, which it should have devoted up to $700 billion (about 12 billion in Kč).
The legislators thus renege on the support of President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
America's actions last Monday, a bloodbath, and the main indicators of actions have been the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index has lost nearly seven percent, having suffered a fall of such a magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress Ceda: US government can inject 700 billion dollars in banks
The leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the US financial assistance agreement.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators made a decisive turn in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial assistance amounting to $700 billion (about 12 billion crowns), granted to the US financial system.
Success is not so sure.
Indeed, prior to being able to publish the final version of the law and submit it to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The support plan of the financial system will be reviewed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
It says Sunday to Reuters Barney Frank, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Regulations of the House.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should be put to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a first major psychological factor in reducing financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which market aid can be effective, it will follow a "disillusion".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have regulated our divergent views on the form of the package of measures to stabilise the market," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
According to it, the final vote could be taken as soon as Sunday.
On Saturday night to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the government a final form.
The latter should buy from financial corporations the real estate assets that lead financial enterprises to significant losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue this plan for the recovery of markets, but I think we are there," said Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the declining stock markets.
According to the Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators ensure that Congress comes to a final agreement on Sunday.
They thus wish to calm investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where Congress's decision could influence Monday's trade.
At the moment, however, it is impossible to state with certainty when the two Houses of the United States Congress will vote, even if the negotiations are not at risk of being blocked, at the last moment, by such or such a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted during the coming days.
However, the law will still be subject to many changes.
The total amount of the system assistance must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
However, if Congress has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, it has the possibility to block the remaining amount, in two steps: first of 100 billion additional dollars, then, to finish, 350 billion dollars.
Mr. Bush welcomed the progress made in the negotiations
Although the President may vote in favour of this decision, Congress has the opportunity to put it into minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain funds for the purchase of bad real estate securities, including the value of the huta, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed on Sunday with the vote of the law, and the Senate Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bilateral effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
The chairman of the Banking Committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, a negotiator in charge, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of contributors against losses, the agreement of damages, the implementation of the time-frame plan.
The new Act also provides for the limitation of the gold parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the programme and establishes a committee that will ensure the supervision of the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for owners who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new accounts in the case of mortgages it will buy, while reducing the monthly debt of debtors and allowing the latter to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological aid
According to the Economist Chief of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its achievement will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that one ignores the mechanism and the price of the purchase of assets to problems.
This point will be decisive to close on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," says Marek, this week, on the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not, according to Marek, so important.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree, as soon as this week, that they support this plan and that they will devote it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters most at this time," Marek stressed.
Extremely driven struggle: MP3 players against mobiles.
We'll advise you on how to choose
While virtually all mobiles know how to read MP3 files, no MP3 reader can make a phone call.
It seems clear from this that it is better to buy only one phone.
It does not prevent enough reasons to seek an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy a high-end gramophone for the house to put Maxim Turbulenc's new album.
On the one hand, such music products do not come out on a vinyl disc, and, from a quality point of view, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are vinyl discs in your layers, with rock art, jazz or blues, you will at least probably dream of such a gramophone.
It is the same with music during the movements, i.e. of compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - of music in MP3.
There are also categories depending on the price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan would have trouble supporting the buyers bought for twenty crowns on the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The life of batteries is also decisive
Some high-quality music players are capable of much more than just reading music, but this is, of course, unknown functions of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the first functions, telephone calls and texting, it is able to read music and movies, record the latter, it has a variable-quality camera and can, for example, even serve navigation.
And if you take the smartphones and the comms into account, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no fridge knows how to grill meat and no television will take pictures, we are practically watching a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without inconvenience.
The more functions you use, the more the interval between two reloads will be reduced.
And reading music is one of the most important energy goinfres.
In most cases, the number of mobile phones that are able to read from music for 10 to 12 hours is significantly lower.
In this regard, music players (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more efficient.
In the case of good-market mobiles, tell them that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you can call from time to time, look for, to be out, a second reload for work - this is even valid for the cheaper devices.
There will be no problem for MP3 readers, which are capable, following a rechargeable, continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performers.
Another problem occurs when the music is recorded in the cell.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a USB universal connector, since not all can be directly connected to the computer without a special software.
Of course, you can record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to get there without reduction, given the small sizes of memory cards used in the mobiles.
With regard to readers, you do not need any software, except for iPod.
Just fill in, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers themselves will create a media library classified by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, style, or then by the user's judgment.
Some devices only show an index with a tree structure, like Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more know-how
In choosing a specific device, you are especially interested in the life of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you are going to listen to it for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you will have enough of any mobile reading MP3.
Almost all mobile phones are now able to do so.
You are not even obliged to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or the reader is able to read.
Everyone can read the MP3s and the great majority of the music that will reach you will have just that format.
It is part of the most widespread formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices also come to read WMA-format music.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common than it is.
High-range mobiles also allow for, for example, the purchase of online music.
It is enough to visit the corresponding operator's (or other provider's) web pages from the mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service to him alone should be a convincing reason to provide a musical mobile.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable and, in most cases, is limited to fast-paced radio tubes.
Prices are no longer the lowest.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (either through GSM, the Internet or the wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear their own furniture.
Every time you want to listen to something, you only have to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
Now, it is also important if you always have listeners or a free handcuff with connection.
If that's not the case, you can use the built-in seats, which have virtually all the mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 readers.
For many, the main advantage of musical furniture is their price.
The less expensive they normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three to four thousand crowns, you can already have a very convenient walkman.
Now, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of exit for ordinary listeners.
The price of the best telephones and the best equipment, also provided for ordinary listeners, does not exceed 15 thousand.
The readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Indeed, no one can ensure the command of the most rudimentary readers - who do not necessarily correspond to the least expensive (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the order with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or of a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a random-connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to select
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the cheapest get out of it even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and you still want to buy a good MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you must not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are part of the most demanding audiences, choose specialized mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are provided with independent control keys for MP3, and this is how the control's ease approaches the one of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that has gone further in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a life span of the battery (normally 3 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the above mentioned brands.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
In spite of this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force traditional operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for a long time.
We have mentioned on Mobil.cz many times the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTU (Czech Telecommunications Office), which noted that the price of a SMS was higher in us than in the rest of the Union, confirmed it.
Thus, following the last steps of the European Commission in the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to arise - the SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of cheaper Czech mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, compared with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really wants to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, since we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this regard, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Czech Telecommunications Office Council (CTU), who said on several occasions that there was no room for another operator in the Czech Republic, complained to the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network seems to have no more chance (at present he would find only difficult frequencies).
But there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a considerable decrease in prices, to which the traditional operators must then also react.
However, even before the entry of the trouble-fests such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those heard today at our home were heard in Great Britain.
However, it appeared that there was room for such operators and that they could have real success.
We are not obliged to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch in Poland of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator has managed to win over 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator of the country.
Let us add that behind the Mobilking, there is the Penta financial group, which has, among other things, the U:Fon in Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they need much less customers than a classic operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile, relatively high network.
Thus, in the world, virtual operators are profiled as low-cost operators - they offer calls and cheap SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile, in Great Britain, offers at least two times less expensive SMS than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, poorly targeting an unusual target group can also be a good start for advertising.
In fact, this operator specifically targets men.
"The real men choose Mobilking - an operator that they like and can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, exploiting this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be possible to go to us too.
Miroslav Čepíký, Vodafone's spokesman, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentary approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
As far as it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offer of services."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, the mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this project successfully, but negotiations in the Czech Republic are not very provocative.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our area," said Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do their best so that a potential competitor cannot appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the business client field, has not been hiding for quite a long time his intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We have a lot to do to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile services.
And the sooner it'll be the better.
We have already held negotiations on this possibility several times with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to move forward in the negotiations," said the spokesman for the Pavel Kaidl group.
So the future may be promising.
According to non-official information, it seems that we might be able to host the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, its creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At this point, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is compared to other very specific ones.
For the time being, no matter provided with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sršeně of the Press Department of Phoneika O2, in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokesperson Martina Kemrová states in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not recorded for the moment a viable and bilaterally beneficial project, which could serve as a basis."
And she adds: "It is practically excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited time frame, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Vodafone rather directs its attention to the fulfilment of requests to obtain its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepíký says in this regard: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we think means most of the inputs from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a lower price and thus to a lower profit.
So what good is it to make it easier for such a competitor to happen?
When it comes to their interests, operators can understand themselves as larynx. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U.S. background also bears witness to this.
The biggest apparent pressure on the ČTU, during the creation of the U:Fon, was that exercised by the T-Mobile company.
Evidence of information available to the public from the CTU website.
Now, today, the U:Fon is ready to use as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted in this regard: "Competition in the mobile market has also been recently amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player will submit it, and especially its services, to high requirements."
However, given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies appears to be disappointing.
However, it is not only the attitude of the CTU, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, the latter adopted, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator concerned regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded for the time being, because the offer of potential stakeholders did not prioritise enough interest for classical operators," Kristián Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the UOHS said in response to our question.
A statement thus made would not surprise the representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, take care that no one benefits from its position on the market, such a statement is more than a waste.
Moreover, Kristian Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their market entry has contributed to a decrease in mobile phone service prices."
However, pressure in the sense of fair functioning of the market and a decrease in prices is apparently not part of the interests of the UOHS.
What is really shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, is of course a matter.
Similarly, a price of strictly identical essence to all service stations is probably due to the accident and the hard fight against competition.
"The Office has not, in this regard, recorded signs of anticompetitive behaviour, therefore there is no reason to intervene in one way or another.
None of the operators have a dominant position, none of them therefore have an increased corresponding responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably even missing from the telecommunication regulator," Chaloupa stated in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the CTU, according to which telecommunications constitutes, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some law experts suggest another vision of things: in order for a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained each time.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
This is how he necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the OAU that three mobile operators are manifestly proceeding in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Reducing responsibility for ČTU is a fairly common turn in communications, whereby ÚOHS washes the hands of the case.
We have already met this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, there has been no success in the renewal of the Telecommunications Act, which has recently been adopted, an extension of CTU's powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised an improvement in the situation.
This is something that the representatives of the UOHS must know very well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can work.
This says, the operation of a kind of virtual pseudo operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains undetected.
These are companies publishing their own price list of mobile telephone services, but the latter are only partially public.
In most cases, there is a question of firms dealing with multi-level marketing.
For example, specific mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms are generally only available to the electorate.
The magic tour consists of the fact that the company is made before the operator is a classic company client, which orders a large number of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it receives special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a return.
"If what you are saying happened, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would consider and which could result in a ceasefire with the company in question," answered our question about this problem Martina Kemrová.
However, it is unlikely that an echo of such an activity will not reach the leaders of the mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator shall object to such a procedure.
In fact, the activities of these firms bring them indiscriminate benefits, and, at the same time, by contrast to the true virtual operators, they do not threaten them at all with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepíký indicates the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are used only by a percentage of negligible customers.
In addition, they are obliged to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot have it fully available in the way of regular clients of mobile operators."
However, this is precisely what should appear strange in the CTU.
In addition, there is another question in the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It must be added that the UOHS has relatively large powers to be able to disclose such an activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the operator's explanations, which claim that there is no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has significantly reduced the price of services.
However, in almost all countries where virtual operators appeared, classical operators were increasingly, more or less, trying to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
It is precisely at this level that, in the developed countries, the regulatory bodies, which did not defend the interests of mobile operators, but those of their clients, have intervened.
Both through formal measures and through informal pressure, they ended up getting the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are dealing with this issue in the form of a hot potato that is released by transmitting it to a close target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in their skills is more than beneficial in these cases.
But don't throw the stain after the cognac.
If the information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear in our home, the Czech mobile market may be moving back.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS can hardly remain unresolved in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Hymne has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech National Hymne.
On Sunday, on the day of the Czech nationality, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the National Hymne Kde homev můj (Where is my homeland?).
Hymne was re-registered by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with heart and an instrumental version.
The song is provided by Katerín Knězynková et Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the hymne arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted the Czech Republic's rzhlas (Czech public radio), he chose to interpret the solo versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both singers, as well as the heart, had a good word, so that we could understand the words, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech National Hymne will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde mův můj held for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the theatre of the states) in Fidlovčka (Kermesse des saviers), the original Czech play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It has become popular and people have spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple naturally became an integral part of the national hymne.
It will remain one of the seven national symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
How 'new' sounds
Common transport (MHD) in Prague will introduce the bullet in their ticket system on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, it will be recorded in the history of Pražský Doprevní podnik (the Prague Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to almost one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard Stock.
Passengers can buy a coupon of 30 days or 90 days (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both will be registered on their card in the information points and offices of the Doprarní podnik (the Transportation Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nadraží Holeshovice, Andel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy online coupons on the Doprarní vonnik websites: www.dpp.cz.
Over four hundred people benefited from the service in the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can permanently forget the tickets in the subway stations, where they had to so far become impatient in long queues in order to obtain paper tickets.
In fact, they will buy their coupon via the Internet and they will be registered on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these contact points, there is at the disposal of passengers a geek with trained staff, which will help those interested in buying online and, moreover, will record the coupon they bought on their card," said the spokesman for the Martin Opatrny project.
Alongside libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic cuts on Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, reminding the machines to make the tickets and the passengers have perhaps already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budjejovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be twenty-four," Opatrny added.
A machine will control the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Just enter the Opencard card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city.
It is known in the periurban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the trains integrated in Pražská integrevaná dopróra (integrated transport of Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and zoned validity of the coupons," explained Filip Drápal tickets from Ropid, which sets out the schedules for common transport in Prague.
Periurban buses are equipped with integrated card readers in the driver's seat.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the recorded cuts.
"In cases where the passenger would need to check the validity of the registered cuts, there is nothing more simple than asking the driver for this information," Drápal said.
Passengers who do not take the periurban buses and do not remember the date on which their coupon expires may re-enter the automatic distributors initially used to record the coupons on the map.
Here, on the screen of the device, information on the validity of their document will be displayed.
The Sudets were demanding a referendum in the United States
The Germans of the Sudettes demanded that Šumava be incorporated into the United States in 1945.
This comes from a letter filed in the collections of the Jihočeská vedecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of the Southern Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the US patronage.
In 1945, certain groups of Germans from the South addressed the president of the United States with such a wish.
This comes from, among other things, a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vedecká knihovna.
From the Germans of Český Krumlov in the letter, the US president is asking not to allow the "shumavská zupa" (a region of forests south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have well understood the situation and we really want to be sure that the words proclaiming that the American troops come into the territory not in oppressors and enemies, but in liberators," is written in the letter "People to whom the fortune of the Shumava is at heart."
Since the relationship to Czechoslovakia is not allegedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - that of brutality, indifference, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take in his hands the protection of Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would give this territory to a foreign state that oppresses and destroys minorities and that nothing has contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the four million inhabitants," the letter says.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire to avenge the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States had doubts about the opinion of the Germans in Shumava, he would only have to organize a referendum in the region, according to the authors, to establish whether his people wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter can, in view of the current knowledge of the history of post-war, appear somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the Sudettes of the time.
While the Czech Germans had to at least consider that the issue of their expulsion from the republic was going to take place, very few of them had the opportunity to do so.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to obtain some form of autonomy for the South.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirmed it.
During the war, he was, as a German of České Budějovice, engaged in the marine in the Baltic countries.
At the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the catch camp in the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to teach them the Czech language.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," says Chalupa.
None of the Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, he believed that he would be expelled from the republic, following the Beneš Decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
One way to characterize the emotional media campaign is to launch the Ministry of Transport on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Rébíček's office believes that she will discourage drivers from dangerous driving.
This 150 million-dollar campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, as well as on tracts.
It should discourage the drivers of fast driving and alcohol on the wheel.
But also remind them to take the belt before it starts.
In particular, she wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians, without forgetting professional drivers.
What's going to happen in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
It also bears witness to the slogan "sangling" throughout the campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "Don't Think" is written in capital letters on the registration plate.
Then, in a blood bottle, there's the phrase "You'll die."
What must symbolize is that we can pay for life a moment of care.
Spots will "hold" viewers until 2010.
The department was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen commonly with dramatic images of the victims of accidents.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
Spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy for sugar and foremanship against drivers
"The one who walks with the drivers is the system of sugar and fuet.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by earning time, when they spark a red fire.
The fuck, it's the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be recalled to the drivers," says Martin Kořán, the transport psychologist of the Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising, the psychologist considers.
Panels indicating the danger to drivers are already less effective.
"When a static panel that warns against a danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the drivers will no longer notice it," Kořán said.
Olmert would exchange peace almost all occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Israeli interim government, voted in favour of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the territories (occupied), or all," Olmert said daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), because without it, peace will not be made," he added.
He admits that the possible return would include Jerusalem-East.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not wish for the tractors and bulldozers to break his feet, as this has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, referring to the two attacks in the city, in July, when several people were killed and dozens of wounded.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places" within the Old City.
"The person who wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the whole city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That won't work," he said.
Retirement of the Golan Heights
Olmert also advocated the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan, which he considered to be an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a retreat from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite Movement); they will have to give up their constant support for Hamas (the Shiite Movement), Al-Qaida (the terrorist network), and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are Stewards in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is forbidden
In the context of the tragic car accident of the Student Agency near Padoue, Italy, the question arises whether drivers and passengers during the journey can move within the car.
"If the law was to be strictly and formally respected, the activity of a Steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," says the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostage died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road of the car.
The young girl was currently unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had at her disposal two other seats.
However, the car may have an accident, or even sudden braking, also when the driver serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the car is based on its technical sheet equipped with standing or not seats.
If this stand-by equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long-distance drivers Student Agency do not have stand places; what was confirmed in Aktuální.cz by the company's director Radim Janchura.
"This is a matter that we have dealt with with the department and, at the beginning, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilets during the journey provided they have their own seat," he revealed his position.
The Law Ignores Stewards
"There is no uniform legal interpretation of the steward role - no legal requirement is taken into account.
On the other hand, there is no legal requirement to prohibit the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," adds Hanzelka spokesperson with more ambiguity.
Josef Pokorny, the director of the road vehicle traffic department, believes that the law is sufficiently problematic.
"All depends on the fact that the car has in its approval the permission to offer standing seats.
Everything lives there," he said.
The cars are divided into urban areas, where there are standing places and a maximum limited speed, interurban with higher parking places and a higher permitted speed and long-distance parking cars with the highest permitted maximum speed and seat-equipped seat belts.
Like on the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Horín, an expert in BESIP (safety of road traffic) in transport, does not see the movement of Stewards on board as a major problem.
"In regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of the service in the aircraft.
No more, it's not sure when a turbulence and the coughing of the air can get in the head."
"Or, if the car had suddenly stopped, the laws of physics would of course be valid.
Just like a bus or a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the driver by internal requirements," he said, and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Janchura is ready to delete these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer Stewards services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the Director does not consider their business as a business at risk.
"Nonetheless, as soon as I have the impression that this is a risky business, I will delete it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and their logbook on board.
This would also reduce costs," he said.
The concern for security is the reason that the director of Asiana Alexei Litvine, who, compared to SA, provides a very small number of lines, gives the absence of drivers in his vehicles.
"We don't have hosts, we've opposed them from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it will end with a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, at Týden.cz.
A Great Tragedy Has Come
A young hostess from the Plzeň region, who has been working for society for two years, died during the Naples line accident.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using a tap and blocked the road to the car.
The driver of the driver tried to avoid him by a sudden manoeuvre, but he broke it on his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of the Stewards have been sold.
"In the case of long distance lines, it is not possible to book these places, they are blocked."
The company has a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For the compensation of the young girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but with regard to financial compensation, it also counts on the guilty.
An amendment to the law?
No view
An amendment to the Act, which has been being drafted for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details on the movement of the driver on board the car.
"Oh, she has not led to any conclusion on this point.
In fact, it is not too interested in the bus, but rather in the point system, at the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of the mobile to the wheel," said expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider Stewards' activity as a fundamental threat to passenger safety," Hanzelka spokesperson concluded, stating that the control of passenger safety is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfois are based on Frankfurt.
The main words were not lacking in the letter addressed by the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of the financial institution of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central institution of the financial markets of the financial group of the Sparkasse" could constitute itself, according to the mail made public on Monday.
WestLB would provide a double "competence block" of sustainable productivity in such a case.
Overall, such a relationship could be the decisive step towards other concentrations in the Länder banking sector.
What does it look like when a steering committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times?
Because the WestLB, injured, is always under strong pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Authority, which has only recently made it clear to the Government of the North Rhine-Westphalia that the time was set for a future solution.
However, it has been a matter of some time already - also on the part of Frankfurt - of a relationship of any form between the Deka bank, which knew the customers of the Sparkasse from their investment funds, and WestLB.
Of course, the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas informed at the presentation of the figures in the late August semester that he saw no sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse's house with a land bank, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Deca's Board of Directors, each half of which is supported by Länder's banks and savings fund groups, has commissioned the Steering Committee to conduct talks with WestLB for joint commercial activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of the financial market.
However, the talks only begin, it is said in the financial place.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, who, with its 3,000 employees, has one of the most important employers in the financial area of Frankfurt, is involved in the issue of consolidation of the savings fund sector.
In 2003, it was believed that Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of the Land of Palestine and Halbab.
There's nothing in this piece of land, though.
The plans had hardly been made public that the government of the Land of Hesse would vote against any participation of Hellaba in them.
Thereafter, the other two houses did not join.
The Bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinate was attached to the Bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new discussions on the deka-Bank's merger with Länder's banks.
However, Günther Merl, president of the Hellaba Steering Committee, had decided against any commercial fusion strategy with his bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling seems to be spreading that the grouping of different public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the elections in the Bavarian Parliament have passed, a BayernLB union with the Baden-Wuttenberg Land Bank could be achieved first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure that forces new mergers is to increase, the potential partners will gradually escape it.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she has so far been more resistant to the crisis than the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The Hesse-Thuringe savings and rotations group, which owns 85 percent of Helaba's capital, drew a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
It'd be hard on the NordLB.
However, such geo-strategic reflections reflect only one facet.
Another aspect asks how the different commercial models of each of these banks can be picked up.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive issue, namely, which commercial model should ensure the future capacity of Länder banks, had not so far been resolved by the German group of savings and rotations.
Finally, a WestLb decommissioning could take place, decommissioning which is obviously not desired here.
This is also the case in the letter from the Steering Committee in place: in any case, a 'global solution' would be provided for the institution.
How will all of this be put in the same basket with the union of some entities with Deta-Bank still to be seen?
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, it's the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanied him as a little friend, so nothing is the same, he said.
Behind them, about a ton of five litres of beer from the Kaiser brand, is a well-built barbuque that shows about 200 visitors to the beer festival which the deep sounds can produce.
Elena taps Luca first, then kiss her.
From Bologna, they came to Veron.
From there, from the road station near the new Puorta station, four buses take off this evening at 23:45, `destinazione Monaco, party della beer', arrived scheduled at 630.
Three buses are reserved first and foremost for Italians, in one of the buses traveling exclusively from Brazil.
In a park corner, South Americans sing gold and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also loudspeakers, explains Marco Guarda, it's not for Italians.
Buses belong to Marco, which has a long double coat of fake fur and glasses to large silver mountings.
For five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three turns nothing like this year.
They go out at night, stay the day at the party, and return at 10:30 a.m.
And spending the night would involve unnecessary expenses, explains Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, stretched in accordance with the Bavarian Cleanness Act, sickness insurance and a German speaking group manager - Marco made a language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses are already rolling in the night on the Autostrada direction 'Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything gets calm on the bus, the passengers sleep.
That's better, they'll still need their strength.
There will be breaks in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates will take a break before Munich, on highway 8.
When in the morning, Marco's group finally arrives at six thirty hours as planned on the parking near Thérèse, almost 50 other buses across Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco has a last speech, explains the attack plan.
First of all, it's the little yellow casket.
On the left is written 'Berry Party', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of the travel agency of Marco 'konscersiviaggiando.it'.
Second: "When the doors of the chapter of beer are opened, we're short," Marco screams in the morning.
Run! Run and book the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Don't go in front, or we're stuck, and not all the yellow helmets on the same benches, you have to distribute them in the room!"
The chop, calls Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the badge!
'Show the security officers that we do well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: `This night, coming back here is ten hours and a half!' Understand?
And that's it, it's gone to the beer party.
On the road, some nine of the yellow caskets on the trees to find the road, the panels and even an electoral display of a large Bavarian popular party.
We're supposed to be ready for the return.
It's the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the 'week-end of Italians'.
There are no specific figures; 50 000 people are talking about going through the Alps and falling into the beer kiosk, 10 percent of the visitors would come out of Italy this weekend.
The municipal police are strengthened by seven South Tyrol policemen, by Italian volunteers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which provides statistics on the countries where Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the attempt of the Hofbräu brewery.
Insomnia nights for Hipo Real Estate shareholders
The German banking system was relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician was using the word "relatively" and that he pretended that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This one actually happened this weekend.
The finance of the Bavarian Real Estate (HRE) real estate company, next to DAX, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect themselves from market turbulence.
One person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters Monday that the aid appropriations were issued up to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
Money comes from both private banks and public law banks.
In the background, it's Depfa's subsidiary that supports the losses.
The state finance was, according to a newspaper article, refunded in very short term for long-term projects for which it had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since the lack of market confidence.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced by 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio was also slightly reduced by 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Current and net profits from financial transactions were, compared to the same period of the previous year, zero-point gains from the allocation of fixed assets and securities and the provision of credit transactions had fallen by more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only thanks to the important benefits of the reimbursement of the low accounting costs resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies that the deficit of the profits of about 16 per cent has been moderated.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state-owned financial had at first miscalculated real estate industrial loans, which had then been affiliated to the Aareal bank.
Because classical state funding was not sufficiently cost-effective, Depfa was then committed more intensively to infrastructure projects and to joint financing of projects between private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and to international diversification.
On the value of the subsidiary, the Real Estate Hypo must make amortizations that should have an essential material effect on the group's calculation of the gains and losses, which still remains rather vague.
The fact is, the dividends have been amputated.
By 2007, they had been crushed to two thirds.
The Hippo Real Estate is, since the purchase of the Depfa, a highly important state investor and infrastructure.
It is stronger than other refinancing institutions in the interbank market since it does not have any customer deposits.
With the failure of the Lehman Brothers Investment Bank two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks was again considerably low, the banks having accumulated their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a share annually - about 50 billion euros - of all the Depfa's credits of a short-term refinancing method.
According to a Hypo Real Estate communiqué, the group's need for funding is covered by medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of the way.
Other sources say that refinancing would be provided through the funds until the end of 2009.
On the other hand, HRE Director Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer resort to medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Establishment for the Monitoring of Financial Services (Bafin) are based on the principle that the capacity of the Hypo Real group on the market is now assured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors have only to wait for it.
However, given the dynamic and impossibility of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Moreover, it is not inevitable that it will not fail to make use of funding throughout its scope.
But the opposite can no longer be removed.
After the bank is, according to the last reported, still at the doors of insolvency at the end of the night, this rescue for the least temporary will not be able to assure the spirits no longer.
The rate of action was 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
The rates of obligations, on the other hand, are particularly good.
While the debt to the first head has barely moved, the second-level loan rates are falling short.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former Württemberg Hypo subsidiary and those that have a life span beyond 2009.
The obligations of the Hypo Real Estate bank seemed previously to be an alternative speculative position, and their value should now be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that led to the crisis in the institution by the purchase of the Depfa bank.
As long as the less-affected emission institutes, governments and commercial banks are still ready to support the system, there can be a time-consuming approach.
Or it will happen what no one can expect at this time - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability of approaching surety today has become a simple founded hope.
This should reserve insomnia nights first and foremost for long-term creditors on whether to separate from their commitments.
In the short term, investors can always use what they have drawn in order to make a deduction of losses for the next years on the income tax on the capital gains of automatically taken stock.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, has to present herself for the first day at Tachibana High School, the girls begin to laugh: the German is so "kawaii" !
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knew this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Trade Log, she speaks of Japan.
"The first day of the course in Japan.
What I was excited about.
Already on the way to school, I was scared.
I live in Tokyo on the outskirts of Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I've got to find the way alone, I'm glad I didn't lose.
The start of the courses does not seem to be fixed as strictly as we do in Basse-Saxe.
The students appear each other after eight hours, until nine hours less than twenty, a table tour begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the course started, it was for me to introduce myself.
I'm not exactly like to speak in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I have not yet had the uniform of the school, I have put on an old jacket from my mother's home, as well as a shirt, blue shoes and black leather shoes.
In this tent, I presented myself to the papyrus, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo She Sylvana...' - I call Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all did the lowest, smile and make signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him through my sleeves.
It belongs to the essential vocabulary for the survival of the Japanese ado and means "mignon, chou".
Then I moved quickly to my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, and she thought it was an honor for the corresponding one to sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quite calm, but when the gong resounded, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone talked to who was better, could laugh and ask me a lot of questions - in this case, it's hard enough to understand the Japanese English.
During the break, they all left their Bento.
My foster mother also made me this kind of lunchbox - it's really other than the miserable Germans.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sauces, a concobre and algae salad, fruits and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating right here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What's certain is that everything's really good.
All right, except maybe the nice confectionery salads, brrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento which she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of getting a little better knowledge of the boy during the break.
I read it in my sleeves.
I'm curious to know if I could observe it here as well.
"Why Japan in particular?" I was asked by my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
So I always said:
"It's like it's fascinating to me, what"
After all, reading mangaes, that's what I've preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the manga and culture that is there, at some point, I also started to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, they're given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have sensations
A rat or a cafard ran into danger, does that mean he feels afraid as well?
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have feelings.
But how can we verify that he is testing the same thing when he acts in the same way as us?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of replies to the question "What do you think is true without being able to have the evidence?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else who has so far been able to prove it, even as we cannot prove that other human beings have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and approach the questions of the senses or in general the consciousness, we will enter difficult-to-practice fields because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he does death, escape, or attack.
Human beings behave in the same way, so some scientists draw a comparable subjective life from it.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make the transformation of our subjective life to that of difficult animals.
One aspect is that the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the prefrontal lateral cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and in the functions of management and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in human beings than in other primates and appears to be completely absent in other beings.
Therefore, at least for these aspects of our conscience, which depends on the prefrontal cortex, including the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is even different from the other primates.
Another significant particularity could reside in the linguistic nature of man: a large part of his existence is linked to language, which often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness should not depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever the way it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our consciousness states.
That is why it is so difficult to determine what the consciousness of other animals may look like.
If this, internal and subjective, is neither measured nor, because of this particular hardware, analysed based on our own experience, then its observation poses serious problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious life, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more readily accessible scientifically.
Animal awareness processes could be examined without taking into account their content, and that is exactly what happened during short-term study on the memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the weight of the Frontier Cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what is the result of the emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its sequences, like the body's reactions) takes hold of the living memory.
In this way, emotions are closely linked to the cortex regions that characterize the primates and in particular the Human.
The subtle degrees of the feeling, associated with our voluable nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of the words and the grammar, distinguish and categorize states to impose them on others other than ourselves.
To the contrary, Antonio Damasio thinks, for example, that feelings from primitive activities are born in the regions of the cortex cortex cortex and the brain trunk, as well as Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brain trunk.
As this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could fully participate in cross-sectional feelings in all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe that is undisputed.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be like fear in men and rats is probably as sensitive as that in both cases: how can one still verify whether rats and men feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cafard was in danger, but if he feels afraid?
In my view, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical vecus.
Of course, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, but cafards on the other hand do not even have a brain.
But is the brain trunk the origin of the sensations?
And even if we could prove this to Man: how could we show it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even cafards (who knows?) have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably completely different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than emotional feelings of rats.
In all cases, progress has been made at the nerve level as one swallows the same thing in rats and in humans.
As I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, or sensations, I don't know if they exist.
We could think of it as a short-term one, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly stabbing myself against a wall.
I'm really a pragmatic emotional.
Platini, President of the UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
The Deputy Prime Minister, Ivan Wasjunik, explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers the UEFA decision in Bordeaux to be evidence of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships," Vasjunik announced.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work is just beginning, and there is still much to be done in both countries."
In the schedule of construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two guests run after the deadlines.
The number of stages for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"The UEFA has kept an eye on us."
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that PZPN is not able to act in the rules," Drzewiecki of the Polish PAP press agency said.
"We have provided in a letter to the President of the UEFA that the preparations of the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League have already been sentenced in the previous season for compulsory relegation manipulation; in the end, the start of the League has even been delayed in the last minute.
Dennis Quaid angry counterattack
She wanted to make the promotion for a new film, talked about her private life in an interview - and now has some trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan raised the veil on her former adult Dennis Quaid.
It stands out - and counterattack.
A late War of Roses for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors surrender to a pitiful battle - the sight and the south of the world.
Last week, Meg Ryan expressed himself in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle on the causes of marriage failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have known the extent of the fraud only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptase of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adult.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his unfaithful husband's qualifications clearly fell: it would be "Monstruux", he said to the "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg restores the history of our relationship and the manipulation".
It would be even more "sufferable", than "the punishment and the troubles that lead to a divorce for each child are re-evaluable in public" for their 16-year-old son Jack."
While Ryan lived alone since the divorce, Quaid remarried and soon became the father of twins.
So his answer was, "In any case, my life continues.
I'm happy to have a wonderful family that goes to the best."
Air ticket prices and hotels drop
In the first half of 2008, hotels and flights were less expensive than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be even reduced to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would be beneficial - this is the result of a study by the financial service provider and American Express travel.
The company analysed its data on reservations in the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, established a net decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already decreased in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities considered still 6.9% on average compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay from 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all of this would be for American Express in the low dollar course that led to a "desire of low travel by American tourists".
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would be as much affected by the decline in hotel prices as industrial sites such as Hanovre, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are maintained with an increase of 26.3 per cent, the record in Europe.
Also with regard to flight prices, the trend was increasing in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, economic-class passengers have to pay on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-term flights, which are highly fuel-consuming, have even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of economic class tickets fell on an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, business class and first class, however, the price variations were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this price drop would on the one hand be flexible economic growth, the firm explains.
The request would come from the ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition by the "Open Sky" Treaty which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A sign of the trend is the removal by airlines of non-profitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have deposited the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies nothing but in Europe.
HSV Bat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple purpose and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the first of the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay still failed to find a functional eleven.
The Kristoff Klein. Grondir. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player will only come late in the game and his shot up failed against the target framework.
His message was precisely formulated, he was out of his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," shuffles Hermann Rieger in the lap of the Hamburg arena.
It wasn't a big deal in the dresses, half the time was over, and most of them were in their seats.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of HSV for nearly three decades, he enjoys a great reputation as well as a number of former protagonists.
And that's why his application was received at strategic locations.
Assistant Coach Cornelius Jol acquired and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the chief coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
So the orders seem to have been similar: and this is the second goal!
There was a lack of practice.
"It wasn't very nice to see you today," Marcel Jansen later said.
Bastian Reinhard would have "suddenness also to be more relaxed".
This 1:0 (1:0 at mid-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful hit by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that very few Gladbach players could not hurt the weak Hamburg players.
"It was a victory room," said Marin Jol.
The SV of Hamburg will celebrate this Monday its 121 years.
As early as Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen indicating their club as the first of the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to take care of it," said Marcel Jansen.
It is suspected that the mid-term result of the table reflects more of the unpredictable character of the first League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen debuché du FC Bayern - is formed in a gentle way, but it is not bright yet.
"We need more charm and more dribble," Jol demanded.
After the failure of the vote
On Wall Street, the scary circle.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan dropped the Dow Jones temporarily from 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of history.
Later, Dow Jones got a little caught.
About 20h30, the world's largest stock exchange index cost 10.579 points with a drop of well five percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange Index was 1548 points with a decrease of more than seven points.
The most lost of the Dow Jones were at that date American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could be any more profit reports.
Bank Goldman Sachs' shares charged a decrease of almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, the major investor Warren Buffet was associated with the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilised for the purchase of what is called damaged mortgage papers.
However, the amount should not be paid once but gradually.
On the other hand, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company that could be exchanged in relation to the evolution of the course in order to reduce its burden on the Public Treasury.
Courses of action in the Europe and the United States
Billions of aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not address investor concerns.
The course of action of the great German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones index collapses despite the rescue of the state's financial market.
The German index (Dax) led to a profound deficit from the courses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank.
The operation of the Bavarian real estate finance has now lost three quarters of its value despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank has charged a decrease of more than 20 per cent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the important psychological bar of 6,000 points and costed 5,839 points with a 3.7 percent deficit.
All over the world, the stock markets have fallen to the knees.
In New York, Wall Street was going to have a very serious loss.
Investors feared that the US Government's $700 billion saving plan could not be sufficient to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809,25 points lost in the first opening time 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The House of Representatives of the United States intended to vote on the rescue plan, and the vote in the Senate should follow on 1 October.
The other European scholarships also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index charged a decrease of 3.2 per cent, and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the main Japanese index of Nikkei fell to 11.743,61 points after an increase of 1.26 per cent.

In the MDAX, Arcandor's shares fell after the announcement of an increase in capital.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to 23 million new actions.
The commercial and tourism multinational has further indicated that the shares will not be sold in Thomas Cook.
From the dark material influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: the dark matter has influenced the speed of space probes as they are called gravitational support manoeuvres.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Because of soon-frozen fuel run, death is a threat.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused dissertation among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manoeuvre of space probes, whereby they obtain an additional wave in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example, the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical technique, as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
This is surprising for researchers from abroad for years: flying objects do not always behave 100% of the way they are expected under the venerable laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the speed level.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists have been unable to explain this effect.
They baptized him the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the attraction force of the matter because of the curve of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study always believes that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support by what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also located near the Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have known the existence of black matter only for about ten years.
It appears to be a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, i.e. it neither sends nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientists, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days at the hands of their admirers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released, as confirmed by the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs.
The Sudanese predators had demanded a bill of several million euros.
Six hostages would have been killed during the firefight prior to the release.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
Negotiations for the ransom would already be undertaken.
The Germans are constantly in the kidnappers gluer.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are clearly free.
This is what the Egyptian TV, the Al-Arabia Arabic television channel and the Italian media have delivered in concert.
The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian Sky TG 24 television bulletins: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, behave well and are safe, the Egyptian national television announced.
The 19 participants in the trip to the desert should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a gunfight prior to the release of hostages still remain vague: thus, kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army kills six kidnappers without shouting at the station.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," the agent said.
It was only to collect the hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers had killed six predators this Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and had arrested two of them.
The tenants had demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money had to be paid by the German woman from one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" said that, according to a German mediator, the release of hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the cheerleaders wanted to release the women's hostages after the payment of the ransom.
Men were to be detained until the predators found a safe way to escape.
The German ambassador to Cairo refused to comment on this account.
The abuse of a beautiful father "who leads to suicide"
A court has been informed that years of abuse caused by her father-in-law have led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Treise, 57, of Stithians, in the Cornoailles, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight charges for indecencies.
Truro's court of great instance referred to him as a regular reading of his beautiful daughter, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years of age.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Melle Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at Mutley, Plymouth, April 1, 2007.
When she was living in Coventry, Treise had tied her up and banned her before forcing her to commit sexual acts, while her mother worked in the pub.
Treise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he will return to the Cornoailles.
His beautiful daughter left for Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Melle Randle, a volunteer of National Trust, was subjected to abuses that had been inflicted twice a week.
The Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told me that Melle Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "lost all hope of life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's beautiful father who had also written a letter of confession that ended up like this: "I am the attachment and the bandis regularly".
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Treise: "You're really weird as a fetishist, your victim must certainly be terrified, especially at the age of 7.
"This devastating saga ended up with the victim's suicide.
And what's even more surprising is that if she hadn't done this gesture, her story would certainly never have ended in court."
He added: "I particularly stress, as described by his father and mother, the effects of your crime committed over the years on Stéphanie.
"No doubt she would be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today."
Condemnation for loss of official data.
The Departmental Officer of the Office of the Cabinet who had forgotten the top secret documents, in June on a train, will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, to the BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was moving when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a waterloo train.
The documents were passed into the hands of the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They would have thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is charged with a violation of section 8.1 of the Act, that is, of the clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the departmental officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Committee of Secret Services.
His lost documents contained appreciation of Al-Qaeda as well as of the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision, Monday morning and was then transported from home to a secret place.
Building companies in front of the B&B invoice.
British construction companies could have to pay an invoice of more than £80 million to cover the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government has provided £14 billion to protect the savings of the 2.6 million savings from Bradford & Bingleys.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that collect the money from the savings, including 59 companies in the building.
The Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it is "angrily" to know that companies and their members will have to pay the broken gates...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's mortgages are disbursed.
But the interests that are going to increase at the same time, will be owed every year to 700 financial companies that collect deposits .
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building companies are included in this list.
It's annoying to see that institutions that have been cautious... now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay a sum proportionate to the deposit it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest in the loan will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Commercial Committee of Building Societies, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "angrily" to see that institutions that have had prudent behaviour in the resumption of the real estate market now have to pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first years.
"We need to consider all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to evaluate the options to be adopted to avoid the companies and their members paying this sales bill," said Mr. Cole.
Interests for 2009 cover seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interests of the whole year will have to be paid, which could also double.
Since the building companies are non-participating organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
The milk increases to five pennies per litre
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that she was going to increase the price in bulk of her milk, five penny per litre, starting on Monday.
This is the second increase in the price resulting from a two-penny increase in February, and is the result of a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retail sellers must decide whether they go to their turn, increase the price to consumers.
Before the increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey's milk had been varied for the last time, in 2002.
An ex-Pm of Bangladesh has been found to refuse bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a request for bail at the former PM Sheikh Hasina, which could thus be arrested on his return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him his bail on the basis of his review because he had tortured a man of business, 50 million Taka ($729,00,00) when she was PM.
This case is one of the many charges against him.
Khaleda Zia, the always rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina should come back to Bangladesh a few weeks ago, but her party, the Awani League, demanded that the country's provisional military government give her full freedom first.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of his release are contradictory because if he was permitted to leave the country for medical reasons, he did not see why he could not remain free on his return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers announced that she would now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's application that she does not need bail because she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique Huq.
"We shall bring an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this security to return to the country in order to prepare the elections in December
Sheikh Hasina should return after October 17th, a former leader of the Awami Party said.
She was held in custody last year after the early military government took over power, but was released in June to care for abroad.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, rejects the accusations they make.
Concerns for the Afghan anti-polo campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children were missing the recent polio immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the United Nations said.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination campaign last week in the six provinces.
But she said she was unable to contact children in the dangerous Helmand and Kandahar areas, located in the south.
A United Nations spokeswoman said that despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the ITV court battle
BSkyB has lost its trial following the verdict of the Competition Commission, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV broadcaster.
The Competition Appeals Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares by 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and had allowed it to influence ITV unfairly.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 following an agreement to prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the purchase by BSkyB, parts of ITV, had raised doubts about the effective independence of ITV, thus encouraging the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the regulator Ofcom were all contrary to this purchase.
BSkyB argued that the need to reduce its share of ITV would not be reasonable and, on the contrary, was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just given up voting rights.
New investigation into the case of U.S. prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to check the issue of the release of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
All of this was from the case report of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, which criticised the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical to the officers of the White House, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political reasons.
The Special Prosecutor, Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"There have been no serious allegations of potentially unfounded criminal conduct, not fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor capable of forcing witnesses to file was one of the greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the radiation in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors formulated by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the Department had stated that the prosecutors were fired for medical benefits.
But then it emerged that the licensed prosecutors were no longer critical of their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to give them political connotations.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others would have refused to investigate false accusations against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and continuing judicial proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but cannot be for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, has been accused of being involved in this licensing case, and in the end he resigns.
A number of ministerial officials from the Department of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered it "first responsible" of these redundancies, and ended by "abdicating" his role as leader," which was remarkablely successful not to be involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including former Bush collaborator, Karl Rove, were critical of failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's age must be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honored at Q Awards for his epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar during the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to obtain this recognition.
The nine-minute and fifty-second song was the title of the hit by Meat Loaf in 1977.
The night of the price surrender is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a limited selection of four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things such as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly a party
The song, written by Jim Steinman, demanded a great voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK, as a single in 1979, in the 15th place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in English rankings, and was sold to over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of her real name, has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing surgery to heal her heart attack became irregular, after she collapsed on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then we found him a kiss in the vocal cords.
A Shadow Street in the City, often forgotten, and Maybe Etre Bientôt en Sales.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, some only functional.
. And even some veteran taxis as well as long-term local residents can't give indications to go to Extra Place because they've never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and travels north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it looks like a dusty goose instead of an active artery.
No panels indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to renew Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to shops and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-term neighbors, said to be charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the house.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that manages the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the neighbourhood owners committees, representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay drew up a proposal authorizing the real estate manufacturer to buy the street.
But the Committee prefers the street to remain in the city's hands, and asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No.3.
"There are only few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to preserve Extra Place" she said.
"They could propose to restore it and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to refurbish the small street and install seats there, some of which would be used by a coffee to which the manufacturer would grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, the spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to operate the street, that does not necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner.
"The main interest of Avalon Bay is to relook for this abandoned departure, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale".
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Immobilier Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, stressing further that the agency's mission was to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to his most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical print.
Some believe that Extra Place has been bearing this name since 1802, when the legacy of the large farm of the many children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving aside this small plot of land, which has been abandoned.
The later entry of the CBGB, a closed punk monument in 2006, opened in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of rails, hailstones, bars, posters, leaves and strings."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about evolution to the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public.
Others proclaimed Extra Place as a true rare—a virtually identical fragment to the city that should be fixed in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who conducts a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contests: An Amerement Nostalgic Look on a City in the Extinction Process") relates the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, dark day as night, and delimited by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and blinds, full of last week's newspapers that fly along the gouts."
With few exceptions, the street is always the same.
A short rat at the bottom of the street, near a door that leads to the CBGB, and which is now the seat of a store of small clothes.
Graffiti on the walls, a 22-ounce bottle of beer, lies next to newspapers that just got thrown out.
A few passersbys said they thought only rarely at Extra Place, and suggested that it be appreciated.
Mr. Field, on his side, said that some under-estimated the attractiveness of the street in his current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have taken place in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The Bilingual debate: Immersion in English
In this part of the Education Supervisory Program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, former student in California, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as well as Good as You Think It. Why the Middle Class must be able to choose their school."
Attracting the favor of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Mr Obama's campaign stresses that "African and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students." It is a true fact.
In order to combat these differences, Mr Obama's educational program particularly supports so many other subjects, "transitional bilingual education" for those learning English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to carry out a bilingual education that defends language-class education other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the east of Los Angeles.
The students of this school are largely Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of the students, consisting of many new arrivals, study English.
Among the CM1, 100% students passed the 2008 Maths State Review, an expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the study of English-language-d'arts
This incredible success was achieved through another ingredient that Mr. Obama advanced.
Sixth Street put on analysis, practice, a continuous capacity assessment and a exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, Linda Mikels, Head of the Sixth Street report, has introduced the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
The total English immersion focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Melle Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, said to me, "We had an enormous success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico 12 months later, if you went away without his class, you would have had no chance of identifying him."
"That walk, she notices, "it worked for us."
Mr. Obama should not take the example of the Sixth Street Prep and reproduce it in other schools composed of most of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results of this school speak of themselves; but the policies on education within his party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and its huge support for bilingual education, obscured the forecast of Mr Obama's reply.
Although it is favorable for immigrants to learn English, Mr Obama has recently considered this matter insignificant when he proclaims that we must all stop discussing the wording of English-language laws.
"On the contrary, he will say, "you must make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should consider carefully the models of education that work, rather than tearing them down or treating them as insignificant.
Cute Net of Oil following the New Concerns of the World of the Economy
The oil prices dropped significantly on Monday, as people fear that the rescue plan for financial marches will not be able to give life to the economy.
Gross oil operations fell by 7 percent to $99.80 in the barrel. The New York Market Exchange, on sales this morning.
Prices have dropped by more than $20 in the barrel since Monday.
In the last two weeks, markets of raw materials have been driven by the financial agitation of Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After having seen an increase of $145.29 in July, prices fell to almost $90 in the barrel this month, before rebounding to the deep uncertainties of the financial markets.
On Monday, investors are once again concerned despite the rescue agreement, the largest in history, concluded this weekend by the leaders of Congress.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the last episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will buy the bank operations of the Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
The analysts at Barclays Capital said that this weekend's frenzy negotiations, concluded with the rescue agreement, seem to have failed to revitalize the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, should be slowed down.
"The prospect of global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors."
"we believe that the raw materials will not escape from this contagion.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand until the American virus spreads globally and in China in particular."
The bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, given the drop in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, they were therefore obliged to reduce oil and gas prices by 20 per cent for 2009.
The Party of the Second Time Determining for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in uniform with the Jets Shaun Ellis, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He was looking at the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this," said Ellis.
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had rarely played under dark clouds.
Then the fourth back Brett Favre managed to take a pass at Laveranues Coles allowing a 12-yard touchdown, a precursor from one afternoon during which their relationship made a bond in advance.
Fafre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a back corner fell and the second, 10 seconds from the mid-time.
"I'm not out of my area" Favre said about all his passes in Coles.
"it's a mediocre player"
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Cole were playing in the trap, the defense beat the Cardinals' fourth back, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards up to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape due to Warner.
In the last change, the loss of Bowens' ball, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this property in the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the balloon, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking advantage of 34 to 0.
It was best that the Jets could have scored in a while.
"The Jets coach, Eric Mangini, to whom we were asked to describe this madness, said "the second or the third time?"
When he was told the two Jets left 21 undisputed points in the third time, Mangini said, "I can tell you that I appreciated the second time more than the third time.
"Many points have been marked in a short time."
Gebrselasia restated, exceeds its world record.
Hail Gebrselasia, Ethiopia, has again proved to be worthy of its title as the best bottom runner of the century, after having beaten his own record of the world at the Berlin marathon Sunday, thus becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory at 2:03:59 from a comfortable race on the course, Gebrselassie fought for 27 seconds his record of 2:04:26, fought last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselasia won the 26th record of the world of his wonderful career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance of 1600 metres from the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselasia had missed Beijing's Olympic marathon, frightening - it can be exaggerated in today's eyes - that air pollution does not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promises to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect weather, 48 degrees from departure, 55 to arrival - Gebrselasia won Sunday, now an impressive average of one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
The track runners like Gebrselasia and Paul Tergat, both kenyans, converted into background runners, have contributed to the reduction of the record of the marathon over two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselasia told reporters, had suffered cramps at the mill two weeks before, and had missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to stay bright, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"It was all perfect.
I was released last week, and today, I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best."
He was reproached, especially in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia – to have too much orchestrated his races, avoiding the world's marathon stars, actually counting on the books as if they were in a track competition, and considering more global memories than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the size of Gebrselasia's capabilities as a background runner.
Sunday Gebrselasia, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. on my way.
Two kenyens elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to deduce Gebrselasia after the file heads had disappeared.
A little over three miles from arrival, Gebrselassie made his final upgrade to take off Kwambai, which ends in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year of the seventh time of 2:19:19.
English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone who won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She could not participate in Beijing games because of a bad back mortgage, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using a skilled strategy, allowing the group of Ethiopian runners and Kenyans to take a good advantage, then passing them about 18 miles 1⁄2 after.
Ascale Tafa Margasa from Ethiopia arrived second at 2:21:31, while Helena Cyprus, Kenya, finished third at 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, the Pride and the Trials of the Black Life
Hidden in the development of its vast park, just a few miles from the sunny, brilliant and giant Orlando, there is a small quiet town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first completely black city to integrate, the children's house of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to do today." The city with five lakes, three Croquet Shorts, 300 dark leather, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and not prison".
It has now become a pilgrimage city
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival in Eatonville every year to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city that she described has become a tourist thanks to her inclusion in the Florida tourist guide edited by The Depression- era Federal Writers' Project- remains a separate place.
She is also independent, worthy, and private that she was not already in the 1930s, when Hurston told us that Florida's black rural population was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little, doesn't know what he's losing".
Although this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also called for an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious in the eyes of foreigners.
"We are very careful about how to tell the story" said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, who has always lived and the oldest parishioner in the city.
"It must be in harmony with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It represents both a historical model of a power of blacks and a community of nearly 2400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of South-South black rural culture - a few times deformed, sometimes acclimatized - which reminds us of the birth of American slavery.
Which would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the whole world through sincere books, full of dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Wee Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located just at the exit of Route 17, a route that crosses the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which ends in the chapter of black history and human drama.
As bold as a big crate in life as in literature, Hurston led the readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parties.
"passed the road to the left," she wrote, "you will find the modern public school brown and white, with its gardens and these well preserved game areas whose Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he hardly knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can serve the passersby.
So, hardly a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with a government car, but also with illiteracy, remarrying, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait everyone liked.
Zora well described the reality "declared Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's young girls who Hurton immortalized, quoting colourless songs, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She added, "Some people didn't appreciate it."
We always remember Hurston as a living and eccentric person, who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, recalled that Hurston used to come into town without warning, on board a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many were laughing at her.
"people were always happy to see Zora" he said.
But he also adds, balancing himself in his post-patrio chair that gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
At Hurston's death in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was already a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman of the Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a grave somewhere in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, no plaque for the great audience.
I do not think that they understood the contribution or heritage she offered to the world "declared Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurton published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurs in the 1980s.
Public officials in Orange County wanted to take a five-way highway in town to replace Boulevard Kennedy, the main street in the community.
The development of Orlando has already moved Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was just giving up a difficult period of his history.
Enforced integration, among other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over the mix of races led to hatred at the doors of the community.
"at that time, a band of young white people came to launch oranges or objects against the people sitting on the side," said Franklin.
"a woman is even dead."
They threw a paste of their car."
In a 1955 letter addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the application of the Supreme Court for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education" insulting rather than glorifying my race."
The residents are now declaring that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the confidence of young people.
"The black children were used to being kissed - I remember it well - we kissed our master in the morning, and also in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, as well as the Head of the Security Council of the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This took time, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white - I mean, there's a cultural demarcation line here," Melle Nathiri said.
Civil rights, on the other hand, have allowed the creation of space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the harm, such as her, armed with a joyful self-reliance and lines of conduct such as: "how can they escape from the pleasure of my company?"
That's beyond me."
In 1975, author Alice Walker went to Hurton's anonymous grave and began to struggle to bring his reputation back to life.
Five years later, a biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, reintroduces it to American cannons.
The highway project came just when the most famous girl in Eatonville had found her attraction.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors viewed her as a lifesaver.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years later, and many come back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the proposal for the highway.
"The five-way failure, extremely fast, is a true civic pride," said Melle. Nathiri.
Melle Boyd summarized all the statement that "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been classified as a historic city since 1998.
A single theme library (recognised, of course, Hurston) will open in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, which will be reviewed.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time be considered as a back alley during a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 per cent black today)
Foreigners who have discovered the story of Eatonville, its reason for being, are still being treated with caution.
You have to ask permission for most interviews, and some things - like the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Melle Jones, a courageous teacher, who has a low level of living red, are always afraid that their island community is not well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride is emerging.
Young people in particular tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered its entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, no better or worse, but also proud, creative, boxing, crazy and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is good for the sincere civil affection to be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-olds, winter Park twins, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people who pass through this area will think: "Oh, this city has nothing compared to others" Alondra Kenon said after the last Sunday lunch.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate the story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, everyone speaks freely.
Still, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the big TV kiosk and TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they were in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the glass and bee offices above their heads, the bankers and cover fund managers who monopolies New York spend the worst "working day in the office" since 1929.
The suppliers continue to falsify on the sidewalks, with their carriages and their muffin plates for morning meetings.
Latinos are always drawn among residential buildings that, like morgues, hang fifty luxury shirts on a yoke arranged on their shoulders.
Office employees continue to make the queue to buy their morning sandwich to the traveling merchants, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4:00 and 19:00 a.m.
I did not feel the crisis despite the completely pessimistic accounts until this afternoon when I decided to open up a new savings account.
Fortunately, I was planning to work late at noon, because I found out at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, 20 people making the tail.
Not in front of the cashier guichets, not to remove the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer's guichette, where the usual customers ordered their bosses, the tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and the new customers would open accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorised personal banker", all made the tail for the same reason I did.
In the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings funds and their subsidiaries that operate only in a state, and who say they treat customers like their families.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank in the capital of $327 was using the bankruptcy syndic, and while the New Yorkers went home for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with a savings of $440 million, desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and shop employees who are in front of me, out of another potential leak, have transferred their money to a bank that seems to them to be reliable, or the one that makes the most rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance these past weeks.
"I understood a lady at my Chinese local supermarket, speaking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank who failed, and her late director general Dick Full, with the same familiarity she could have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform concierge of my apartment, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my fruit and vegetables market.
She told me, after my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take risks."
Muslim graves profaned while Austria turned right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and , Philip Dewinter of the right Belgian Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "city against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road panels illustrating red-haired mosquitoes.
The Police accuses extremists of profaning an Austrian Muslim cemetery, the weekend ending of the victory of the political parties of the extreme Right to the general elections of the country.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; this is according to the police, an organized action.
The offenders painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as David's Star; however, the detectives believe that this could have been done to defuse the hatred of extremists against Muslim immigrants.
This could be some kind of election-related accident.
A spokesman for the Islamic Local Community stated that he was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of this profanation, which occurred just during the religious month of Ramadan that touched him to its end.
Austria is seriously thinking of finding its courage, following its oscillation to the right during yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that picked up almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, conducted an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, as xenophobes.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18 percent of the votes, campaigned against the foulard and burkas port, and even expressed his opposition to the food alaha.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections have defined the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who have made the difference because they are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter prohibits travel abroad.
The courts banned the rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuse on children, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after expressing his intention to go to Spain through France.
The Kent Police had granted this prohibition to travel on Thursday after proving to the magistrates Glitter's guilt for sexual abuse on children.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at Ashford's limited court hearing, but was still represented by his lawyer Cork Binning.
One court spokesperson stated " Thursday, 25 September at Ashford's court, the Kent police asked for an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling in France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't present then."
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, leaving to be included in the list of sexual abuse charges.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he may punish up to five years of imprisonment.
Kent's police said that she would not discuss particular cases or potential Glitter movements in the county.
A spokesperson for the Kent Police said "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children as foreigners.
"We think it is easier to monitor someone who lives in the United Kingdom because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, in a much more effective way.
"protecting Kent's inhabitants is the most expensive intention for the Kent Police, and we are closely monitoring the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the region in order to minimize potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls, aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane for Bangkok from where he would have to board for a flight to London.
But he says he's not feeling well, and he refuses to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from controlling the passports, and in the end he left in Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused entry into their territory, and were therefore obliged to leave for Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on August 22 and, remained there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to Uxbridge, West London, for registration in the list of persons charged with sexual abuse, as requested by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been sentenced to four months in the United Kingdom for child abuse.
One source of the Interior Department stated that Jacques Smith, the Minister of Interior, was reassured and happy to know that Glitter had been banned from moving to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master outside the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photograph
We don't even have to wear extra clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, released from all tensions to obtain the aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
The other one, the person.
Inseparable except in privacy, at these times unknown to the general public, where we discover intimate gestures and stolen sights of artists who do not care to get on stage.
German Günther Bauer combines in "Flamenco - people" theatricality of some scenes with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer repeats the particular iconography of the flamenco under different angles.
Included in the programming of the Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of the flamenco, larger every day", explains the creator, who explains that "Flemenco - people" "may be any one but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These photographed "in the street" are artists capable of conveying on stage passion, sadness, joy... by catching the public.
In order to capture moments of personality of these artists, there is no need to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and a clean character.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera of the instant personality of the flamenco stars."
With the festival "Popular Chant des Mines", Bauer started a long journey in 1997 to photograph the singers, guitarists or dancers with a record camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the equipment, remind the classic photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of the flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not about dancing or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captures the audience with his art.
The search for essentials and magic has been the constant of this work presented today at the El Fotómata gallery.
The flamenco beads such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about sixty-ten photographers.
The project has become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book collecting portraits exposed to the gallery.
The passion for the portraits of Bauer led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Old Sports Portraits" ("SportARTProject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of people, to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a longer or less time.
I think in the photograph the portrait is the most difficult kind.
You find yourself in front of people, characters you sometimes don't know or leave you only a few minutes to take a picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flemenco - People", is presented at the Galerie El Fotómata, located on the 20th Street of Mata (parallel street of Hercules) which will be opened until the next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he wrote is "true boldness"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to move forward the new project he is working on, a novel that has for the main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived in the Congo for 20 years and has been passed by the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize in Literature confirmed yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupys it is "a real courage" and that "all it shows that it should not write it".
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the Festival of Exchange of Thoughts and Thoughts that for four days saw hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people in the city of Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was the most expected character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled its contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award to the majority of the participants, finished the show at Juan Bravo.
The festival's presenter, Félix Romeo, met with a fascinating audience who did not see the time when Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, retraced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst for reading" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote "very methodical" through intensive documentation, correcting and rewriting a part of the text to face his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels.
Hispanic-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "rendering less likely people", because writers were asked "not to let themselves go to the frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
The bad weather takes away the fare of Pozoblanco
The festival of flags that concluded the pozoblanco fair's taurus races was suspended yesterday morning, after horse-towers verified that the arena was impracticable.
In this way, the organization committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the taurus race.
The evil of time has come upon this fair, as finally two parties on three could not have taken place.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second scheduled bull race.
At the show, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who had to face in the arena of Castilblanco
So only Friday's party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was brought in triumph, after having made movements of arms in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
The afternoon itself, Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the discovered gradients applauded more than his struggle in himself with the bull.
Worse yet for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he suffocated most of the audience.
Police check of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hachisch found
Five hours less than ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the police of Euskadi (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Armenian Community (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van, and the latter take over the escape.
His load, more than two tons of hachisch, of what to stop them.
Police officers pursued them and arrested one of the two occupying officers, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A. J., according to the information disclosed by the Ministry of Interior of the Basque Government.
The individual arrested was accused of drug trafficking and document falsification.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a vehicle check on N-1 at the border of the Armenian Community.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed the orders, suddenly accelerated and control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers away on the lower side, where the two occupants went down to escape into an empty area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two inhabitants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hachisch they were carrying and found after inspecting the Iveco Daily.
The later part of the vehicle was loaded with hachisch balloons. Then they moved to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, officials found that the registration plate had been "false" since it did not coincide with that written on the grey card of the forklift, that is why they charged the detainee with a falsification offence.
Ertza continues his investigation to arrest the other suspect, who has managed to escape and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old detainee, A.A.J., has been alerted to the various approaches and will be judged within the following hours.
Actor Heather Locklear stopped for driving under the influence of a drug
Actor Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of a medication.
A witness saw him perform strange maneuvers trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, after a spokesman for the California police patrol revealed to the People magazine.
The witness pointed out that at 4:30 p.m., Locklear "assisted deeply on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get out of the garage, and walking back several times, she rolled on her sunglasses".
Shortly after, the witness, who had not initially recognized the actress, saw Locklear stop in the middle of the highway and left his vehicle.
This person, at the time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She had a disoriented air," that's why agents led her to the drug and alcohol center to perform a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was eliminated from the beginning, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we retired from Locklear under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested, suspected of driving under the influence of a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated at 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was hospitalized to care for a nervous depression.
Callasares asked the Andalusian Federation of the Union Gauche to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The coordinator-general and Member of the Union Gauche, Gaspar Llamazares, today stated that it was the regional federation to decide on the case of the former advisor to the Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of treating his family favourably.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and this will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said about the behaviour of the political party that he will have to adopt within the municipal council of Seville.
However, the leader of the Union Gauche requested that investigations be made "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The Union Gauche has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all officials".
"Mayo's blood," Garci's bear bear
By inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci reclaims the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "The Blood of Mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his film with nearly 15 million euros in budget.
The filmmaker has tried "to stage many characters and illustrate the social analysis" which he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, has he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film of more than two and a half hours, "Mayo Blood" will be released in the cinema halls next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
Grand admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci ensures that with this tour "a child's dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who charged him, three years ago, to film a memorial for the two hundred years of May 2, which he always accepted when the story was held by the national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Madrid Community constitute a "unique opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with appropriate decorations and clothing the ambience of "a Spain that has failed as leader for the fight, since the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellion under Ferdinand VII's rule", he reported.
But the filmmaker regrets that he did not get funding as for the movies" Captain Alatrix" or "Goya's ghosts" - more than twice the one obtained for "Mayo's Blood" - because he couldn't turn a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcarcel, with which he collaborated during almost all his career.
The filmmaker of "Volver has started" has influenced his usual way of working, on the stage of the actors, with whom he has the habit of repeating before he starts the tour and to whom he does not make a casting, since it seems to him to be "humiliant" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and cinema to keep himself informed."
Many actors in "Sangre de Mayo" repeat before the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larranñaga or Fernando Guillinén Cuervo.
Four times as a candidate for Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films representing Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Mayo Blood", "Seven French Billiard Tables" and finally the winner, "The blind turners", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "who would deserve to be better known", he said.
With this movie, Garci doesn't expect a price.
"At first you think you're working for dessert, and then you realize that you're working only for prosperity, and now you're happy to make an extra movie," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón gets into the skin of the Sevillane dancer Tortola Valencia
A sevillane dancer will pay tribute to a sevillane dancer too.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and a Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valencia), was born in the district of Triana and will live in London with her family at the age of three.
He was a free dance dancer and a specialist in eastern dances.
It was a passionate life, pioneer of the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and complained about the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who marked the history of the dance in Europe of the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered to interpret the Sevilla dancer Tortola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we're not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think about the flamenco.
Thus, "the dance of the papillo" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and "the dance of the snake" at some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to her," she said.
The stage was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: the one by Miguel Poveda who sang Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done at "La porta openta"; and the one by Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with the one who was his student.
"Tortola's meal turned into a mature character.
I am happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me."
The stage was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the beatings of El Pájaro, and the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, who "played the role of the eternal companion of such artists who were considered divine".
This work also relates, in a way, to the life of this woman who has been displayed in such distant places, especially for the time being, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she was normally living in London.
"I wanted to remember it because I think it is these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows or appreciates their work," says Bayón.
The show will start at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a Recently Married Poet" in the Church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón " comes to an end with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition " Juan Ramón Jiménez: This people of light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling to various Andalusian provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia purchased eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a recently married poet", edited by Pedro Taberno and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America Please Less Without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was part of it."
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "No Malic," and well illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in view of the striking idea that Newman is no longer in this world.
I had the pain of getting an Oscar.
He hasn't been back since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
That was a hard time for everyone.
"Sometimes what a person feels is going through, and now I've lost a great friend," said Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to his existence."
No one was afraid of becoming ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of the cinema and the country died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and bourgeois markets are afraid, American estimates have fallen very low, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When times are so hard and there is no reason to live, there is nothing left of human beings but admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He incarnated an ideal of beauty and truth for everyone.
He was Richard Nixon's enemy and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of his late age as a result of an overdose and the creation of his own bio-food brand.
It was a victory for a country that had the penalty to be imposed on a selfish food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration hit Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar Sam Mendes, said working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad boy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He put us in the top bar," said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who is trying to penetrate the screen like Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious private life and far from goals.
It is still not easy or possible in the media jungle of today.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years in Joanne Woodward, to whom he was loyal even though he did not lack the opportunity to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to be funny.
In heaven, he proudly attends the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he interpreted, he was never as proud as the one of the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and the philanthropist," he said.
Madrid in the 2016 Olympics event
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race, we're not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever had.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would have been the subject of an elimination note.
But let's look at it in detail and at the beginning.
Errors begin with the removal of files, which forces you to move forward.
This is not bad, but if they move you, it would be better than giving you everything (including the electronic arrow for the races).
Well, no.
They only made you go down there to take the file (first error, move only for this) and (after a long waiting file) surprised! there was only the size ' S for the mall (second error, because I need an XL size)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they have decided to buy more than small-sized millets with less fabric and less expensive cutting?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that you have to go there very soon to remove the electronic chip, the waiting line is 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave your bag behind at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible as 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long waiting line, the competitions began and we had not yet left our bag behind at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
Moreover, the rain accompanied the waiting period of more than 40 minutes during which the barracks and raids took place.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be in the classification with the right time, because of the fist they gave me who, I think, did not correctly mark the departure.
Of course, if they asked me to quote a perfect example of race, it would not come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the city host for the 2016 J.O.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
A new system of image recognition and human interaction was presented at the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, a species of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move into the company's campus) in response to what was asked to do during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, which are - including recalling what positions they occupy - and listening and listening to the key words of their conversations.
But also group them by conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person, but she understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asked if she was here to visit someone and she told her that she would answer in a few moments.
All of this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course that is the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week, more than one change in Microsoft's strategy was discussed.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will no longer have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would be five times faster.
This is a discovery because Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change in strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on the part of Google to compete with Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary as it is the essential basis for the computer equipment and software to be understood.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your beautiful mother.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but we need to see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system but increasingly to the Internet browser.
We use the computer only to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
To whom do half of the applications provided with the system serve?
Who can do the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain less applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, full month, less complex.
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services to finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I'm showing you an example.
The photo presented in this article was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the restrooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the drink distributor, a display of their request to use their own search tool - "Tas search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not leave at the beginning of 2009 but by the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them money.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso hung him on the Côte d ' Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wearing one in Edward Zwick ' s Blood Diamond, as well as Al Pacino ' in the Paris ' of Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the holding of the Association of Muscle Gays.
And if we were to list all of its appearances, we could also mention this Mustachu cost that raised weights in an ambulatory circus.
It's not just a simple masquerade in cotton, mollusk and without sleeves.
The English call 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles stands out among all others.
First of all, by his flamboyant name - although known as ' Marcel ' - which has to do with sport as he takes the name, according to legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel is distinguished from others by his excellent cotton, by his unison, by his distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag (unrecognizable) that the most well-known body mallows are in the tail.
But attention, because the Belgian brand only produces top tanks.
But it also produces sweat-shirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothing designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it's damaged to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't bother me"
His enormous similarities with his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, Cruz sisters take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
According to Monica, they are only beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
It was presented with the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new social headquarters but also with the presentation of the most important prices of the fashion that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica's hot and scared.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I myself have created for Mango for the new autumn and winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner of the Opera in the honour of Valentino.
A very intense day, but at the same time exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The film of the 1950s and 1960s enthralls us and inspires us a lot for our collections.
I love to stroll into town and watch women to see how they dress, how they combine their clothes, I often do so.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very polyvalent woman, aren't you?
I believe that yes, but at the end of the day everything goes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was young, I liked the clothes; I'd like to go to my grandmother's house to look into my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the attraction park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my clothes.
Dancers love to dress well for courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you wear clothes, that's where you actually put yourself in the skin of the character.
All of a sudden, it's all connected.
You haven't been there for 30 years, has it been hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30s are happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoy life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done all the things I've wanted to do since I was little, and that has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So you think you're going to be a mom?
Of course, I want to be a mother because my body asks me to be a young mother, and I also want to be a young mother; I don't want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movie, you're waiting for the different movies you've been shooting last year to come out.
It's true, I'm looking forward to them coming out.
I'm a woman from the theater, I'm very impatient and worried, I'd like everything now but of course it's not possible.
I'm hoping to make the films 'The Last Hour' and 'Searching for the tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what you're gonna think...
A few days ago, you started on the pass with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't go up on the passageway to make the mannequin.
It's just, Naomi Campbell called me, I know her from time to time, to invite me to attend a charity show in London for her association in support of the women and the clothes we showed - I displayed two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold to auctions to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
The people Naomi is a tender person.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
Besides, it's so good that Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to show up for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to make the pier, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Residues of alcohol on the wheel will have to install the 'alcohol' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative sanctions for alcohol, to install a system in his vehicle that prevents the vehicle from starting in hive condition, or if he does not breathe.
The initiative has already been announced last June, and it now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last a year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road re-education courses.
The Minister of State for Road Safety but also the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Institute of Technology for the Safety of Vehicles will participate in this initiative.
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of the motorists arrested for driving more than once in hibernation, the car resumed.
The alcohol would avoid this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the oil and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe before; or when the driver’s alcohol rate is higher than the authorized one.
Its cost is over EUR 1,000 and is in charge of the driver.
In this respect, a study conducted in 2007 in the United States showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced to 65 per cent of the offences during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save 115 people every year.
This measure only applies to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, as legal reform can be done by ordinary means, but the reform done by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental vehicle.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote on an initiative by the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install this system in school buses as it was done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 17:40 a.m., scheduled official time, the Spanish Air Force aircraft in which the Asturias Princes traveled to the Presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the watch to lie down, but his rays still forced him to put his hand in the eye so that he could see the royal couple coming down from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier, I had asked the cab driver on the street, if he was aware that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to complete their official trip.
- Oh, well, you're not gonna be able to go to the airport to pick up customers right now... are you here or...?
- No, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here thinking for two years.
- Oh, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who are the Princes of Asturias and knows the importance of the trip.
They are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military range of 27 Marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in sea blue, the Princess, when she has hair in the wind, is dressed very highly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm threatened her.
They make a brief stop with photographers before going to the room where the official court is waiting for them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a regolo journalist of Mexican television awaits them.
The most prestigious price of fashion
There is certainly no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion price than Paris and there is certainly no designer living more wonderful and good living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards, to strengthen the international image of the new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded at a price of EUR 300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his models in Mango's window at the 54th Boulevard Haussmann in Paris, and she almost wept.
Of course it is the second largest brand in Europe that has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylisticist Valentino, president of the competition board, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the Garnier opera in Paris.
With a table next to the extraordinary Chagals family, the Presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown up in the heart and making a good heart against bad fortune, because of his brother's recent death, Nati put on a mango suit and some ELAH wall, which cut the breath, and arms on it, arms down with his son Luis - a beautiful man nearly two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a man gallant, as well as the Baron of Rotchil ended the night without a veston because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who presented herself to the store with a pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who was metamorphosisd for dinner by wearing a long sexy and black dress, was excited when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the Ballet Repetting Room and recalling the good old times, she caught one of the bars and she made the gesture of a 'big fold'.
Inés Sastre did not remain for the visit of the palace dependencies, but she showed us earlier on her mobile phone pictures of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man who moved by motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his drawers, his towels and asking for the front, that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, it's life.
1001, the amount of stress
There are only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of daily life.
And to crown everything, they are all listed in a book that will bring relief to the librarians on September 30th.
The morning wake attracts us almost every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse when we think of the rhythm of activity that imposes our present life.
The office is synonymous with tension and the back pain computer.
Stress represents the evil of the 20th century.
But there are neither two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But it's 1001, not one more or one less.
In addition to yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book all a 'menu' of methods adapted to taste and time of each.
The work against stress is entitled ' 1001 ways to relax ' and will reach the libraries directly from editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain peace in relationships such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' is such a curse.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural income that help you relax.
If adrenaline does not cut into your veins to restore your body balance and if stress has become a problem, it is time to sit in the couch, disconnect from your mind and concentrate on reading.
Speak a dormant
Some kids talk during the night.
I do not report to those who wake up very waking up by telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who talk during their sleep.
The first time this happens can surprise you, but actually it doesn't matter.
It's a welcome alteration to sleep that's called sleepiness.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course there's more than one who talks during the night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadic (once in life, for example, associated with a severe fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child is no longer remembered.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often linked to other sleep alterations such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (insomnia in bed), or sleepbullism, but this is not always the case.
As we have already said, they can also be associated with very strong fevers, stress situations or overexcitement.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, murmurs or otherwise with screams, tears, long speeches ...
If sleepiness becomes very common, it would be fair to observe the child and consult a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes much anxiety and to get an explanation of this problem.
We said that it is a welcome alteration, so there is no treatment, except if it is related to another alteration in sleep that can be treated (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, find quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have the pain of relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the dreams appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember no more than what happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'll wake him up.
Even if he's talking, he's asleep and he's resting.
Remember that if he becomes very anxious several times, he is advised to consult a doctor or to check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), do not have the temptation to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because you're sleeping, he's not conscious to be able to organize his mind.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, from the sudden attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can question him during the night to know his secrets.
It's not even fun.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illusions... finally
Illhaeusern finally found the path of victory on his field after a long period of disset.
Without a big match, the Young and Black have created the greatest number of opportunities and have succeeded in transforming one for the win of the game.
The rhythm was not much supported during this meeting where attackers had trouble expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the captain Kauffmann who was smashing the candle on a remote shot, Illhaeusern was going to take the climber and tour to the Fonderflick tour from far, then with Hirn above, the Roman at the end of the foot or even Diebold came to take the defense of Denmark.
In front, we were stuck in the middle of the ground and just left Riahi behind at the point of the attack.
The beginning of the second half time was to be decisive with the first two occasions signed by Riahi and Temporale for Denmark, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhausians by Marais, well positioned to resume a dance based on a first attempt by Diebold (53e').
But the Illhausiens butter will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be forced to get the clothes back a dozen minutes later and leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Denmark will not be able to take advantage of it and will not put a big problem on an Illhousen Eleven who just retreated a little to "compact" his defense, except in the last seconds of the game where, after a big crash, the ball passed very close to the transversal.
Sarkozy at the meeting of the angry fishermen
Before flying for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a tour of Britain.
In view of the demonstration of the strength of fishermen who had seriously disturbed the access of several British and Norwegian ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he will "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit at the same time as a general meeting of the "crisis committee" established by British fishermen to obtain measures against the flow of gas prices, which reached a record of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Elysée David Martinon's spokesman, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses find competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and compensation for marines".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out shell operations in Morbihan and Calvados, which resulted in bubbles about 10 km away.
Quiberon's pleasure port was also blocked, but links to Belle-Ile have not stopped.
A filter barge has been launched on the nearby island of Quiberon.
The marines have already shown their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets from early dawn in front of the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic and Manche facade, such as the Sables of Olonne, in Vendée, where the boats remained on the quay, or in Havre, where twenty ships blocked the movements of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, in Loire-Atlantic, stopped in the evening the block of the important total Donges refinery.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting in the department to decide any action.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not miss anything" and "do not want to move to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Fisheries Committee of Lorecent.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on the gasol, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre but they believe that the profitability threshold of a boat is only below EUR 0,30 per litre.
Paul Newman's Beautiful
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancers at the age of 83 in his home of Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes welcomed the legend of the film and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft table of 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that are planning on the world economy.
The fourth global aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 delivery devices, said his president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects much from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving up more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the US monetary authorities have flown, plans to give up more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that has been advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retirement activity in the United States, states the paper that mentions sources close to the file.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met in the evening to consider possible transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation can be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to separate include its International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurance and its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on these transfers, continues the FT.
AIG must quickly realize liquidity to repay the loan of 85 billion that the Federal Reserve has allowed it to see US authorities taking 80 per cent of its capital, diluting the current shareholders by two proportions.
Analysis Paris History of the meeting Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange charged a historic drop on Monday after the rejection by the House of Representatives of the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or a never-seeing loss near the 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the strongest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, which is technologically dominant, increased to 1.993,73 and the standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1.106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street drowned after the unexpected rejection by the House of Bank Rescue Plan representatives, which was to allow for some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 against, the representatives rejected the Secretary in Treasury Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"This shows the extent to which the market was in this regard," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would not "be too late".
"If the project is actually dead (...) then the relay will be passed quickly to the Fed (the U.S. central bank, dnlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further strengthen the credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, a head of economy at Global Insight.
And accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
After the failure of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated rapidly, leading to emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, and sign that markets face "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis", FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has been very high.
The 10-year-old Treasury return to 3,632 per cent, against 3,827 per cent on Friday night, and the 30-year-old to 4,161 per cent, against 4,357 per cent on the watch.
Obama, winner at the points of the first television duel
At the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House, another one came to know who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, took it.
No surprise, Republican and Democratic campaign QGs announced their own victory in this television duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, was not "blilliant" enough to allow him to make his drop in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion survey published on Saturday, gives a five-point advance to Obama (49 per cent versus 44 per cent to McCain), believes that it is the democrat who pulled his spin from the game.
Among the undecided voters, who count, Obama won 39% of the polls, while 25% of them won McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his progress on Thursday with the expected good performance of his colliery, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She has good instincts," said Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seven-year-old McCain had not ceased to put forward his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "neighbourliness" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that... he's accused on several occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president," he said.
A hammered attack angle since yesterday in the Republican television ads.
Obama pointed out that he was the future.
Without disassembly, it became clear and precise.
It has put forward its ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama, if," said, this weekend, a democratic spot reproaching the Republican for not taking all the measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American Street".
"For the forty-nine minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, said Obama, yesterday, before 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a rainy rain.
He did not even pronounce the words "average class" or "workers." The financial passage clearly benefits Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the most likely to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"The next week could be a decisive turning point," he estimated, yesterday, the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an elder of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current debate "is the final verdict of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating that it would still be possible to reduce the taxes of 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's sub-stations, the Illinois Senator also noted that the country's possible energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, he, wanted to build a 45 nuclear power plant by 2030.
In fact, the two candidates failed to address the financial saving issues of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents manifested themselves on Sunday night at the main site of Belarus's capital in order to reject the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evening after the voter offices closed in central Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some agree not even to vote: "What's good, because they'll do what they want from my voice," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime which has done good is a foreign observer in order to regain language with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered by observers.
They haven't been in the opposition.
"We were kept apart from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the decommissioning," said Iuri Potemkine, the spokesperson of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous group of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change, says Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidency and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is that it counts the votes, and in us, it's the executive power.
If members of the opposition enter Parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean television space, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis, and we are not reforming, we risk becoming a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, does not recognize the validity of the vote.
She stressed that the number of participations appeared too high, and that the generalization of the vote by anticipation (26%) of the voters in Minsk) had opened the voice to all manipulations.
"You have noticed that there was an election, you ask the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozuline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five Members of the opposition to Parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls again in the place of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
The Interview - Two Safely Rewarded Blood
Hema-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice because Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he regained the confidence of the public that had been seriously shaken by the scandal of blood contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, to highlight the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would no longer occur.
While Judge Krever was late in filing his report, some provinces then set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, almost 38% of the people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalled.
The situation was discouraging.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground during the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said before she proudly stated that in early 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Decary, however, maintains that "trust is something extremely fragile."
On 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, many cases of the human form of the disease of the mad cow, a new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, were seen in Europe, which has been holding the strong since its founding in 1998.
"And we did not know at all if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
It was then based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gelineau reports, which, when not known and which a serious disease can result from, in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterized by a degenerence of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, therefore, the blood of those who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980 was refused.
Now, a few years ago, there was no doubt that this disease was transmitted by blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle applied had meaning."
In 1999 a much more sensitive HIV testing technique appeared on the market: nuclear acid (TAN) tests that directly detect the presence of the virus itself in the donor blood and not of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have allowed for the short period of mobility, which ranges between the time the person was infected and the time the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our technicians, explains the specialist.
This period was reduced to less than one week.
This has significantly reduced the risk of some donors being infected without knowledge and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, a person of 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before HIV is transmitted by a blood product.
I believe that today we can feel at ease with receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health," says Hema-Québec's head of management.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogen is going to emerge in the system.
Not later than last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
Hema-Quebec must be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to security supplies, Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate supplies.
"The needs are increasing because the population is ageing.
As anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need recharge in red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors, which has an average of only 3% of Quebec's blood donation eligible."
However, every healthy person, aged 18 and over who meets the eligibility criteria may give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of those who offer their blood are not accepted because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have been travelling in a country where malaria occurs, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we can maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Poverty is very rare.
But there is a need to renew the members of this donor network as they age and cannot give any more of their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to hold them back and encourage them to become a regular donor.
Today's life is so infrequent, it's rarely the time to spend an hour giving his blood," says Francine Decary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that are almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Québec which also manages the only public blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was already considered a biomedical waste is a blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the establishment of our thousand blood sample of cordon and is expected to take more than a thousand per year.
We should begin to propose this for graffiti at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Decary, who describes this program of blood collection as very popular.
"Several mothers are disappointed that they can't have access there," because Hema-Québec has no means to propose this complex and expensive program in all Québec hospitals.
Soccer - The impact in semi-final
The impact of Montreal was qualified for the semi-final round of the final series of the first USL division, thanks to a victory of 3-1 (4-3 total targets) at the satellite Sounders, yesterday, during the second and final match of the quarter-end series at the Saputo Stadium.
The ground environment Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half without purpose on the one hand and on the other, the David Testo and Rocco Plancentino field environment marked the other tracks of the Montreal training.
Roger Levescu was the only one to enjoy Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let us remember that during the first round of the return series on Friday, the impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, at Seattle.
The impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-final.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder completed a 3-1 deficit in the return match to bring it back 4-3, but the Whitecaps also joined the semi-final round 5-4 in total goals.
The impact should face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - The victorious goal of Kovalev
The trio number one of the Canadians is ready to take over the season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 Canadian win against the Florida Panthers, last night, at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goal, Plekanec collected two aids, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev won the victory by marking the only purpose of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet, I've warned the Russians.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried too much to do it in the first period," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a good ovation."
Charest on the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the holding of elections before the end of the year
In place of the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went to Québec yesterday in Jean-Talon, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) attempted to be elected at today's partial election.
"Refine the limits of our last large northern border": such is the long-term ambition presented by Jean Charest with visual strength while remaining in the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Québec, Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was designed a kind of Moulin with images.
On three huge screens, there were spectacular scenes of hydroelectric dams, mining, and Québec as seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means, as in the electoral period.
In the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude him from holding the elections this fall, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "Nord Plan" is the fourth bread of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's recent speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister was reluctant to explain why the North was "a jewel to immense potential", but did not give a deadline, investment amounts, or a priority in future projects.
At least a few avenues of what could be further developed: in particular hydroelectricity, the forest, but especially the mining sector, doubled by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as big as France", "it's in us, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it in us, but it is in us," he insisted, as well as showing that he was seeking a national founder myth.
Québec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, has it stressed: the road to the gold in Abitib, the Quebec engineering, the Bay of James.
"It's for us, it's our future," he added, after having taken a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70 per cent of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister stated at the press point.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I repeat that position on behalf of the government," he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the passage from the northwest, which will open all year round because of the source of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that the occupation of the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létruneau (former Pakistani member of Hungary), have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) had an important place to start work.
The prime minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be given".
North development would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be "concerned, ordered and respected by the environment", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as continuing with that of the prime liberal minister who preceded it.
"Like the Liberals that preceded us, we have thought differently to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's head.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed rebaptizing the Beauharnois Central in the Adélard-Godbout Barrier.
"De Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, in Lesage, who made the Calm Revolution and nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Burrassa, who made Baie James, our party was able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
In the press, he referred to another reference, conservative there, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing Eastmain1a-Ruper's hydro-electric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that his service was scheduled for 2012.
"It's still between us, but I'm planning to be there," he told his militants, and they've got a lot of applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and no doubt in 2009, did not deviate from the possibility of holding a vote this fall, which the law allows.
He points out, however, that his schedule is full, including a mission by the Federation Council in China and a summit in Québec-New York.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that were passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ in particular called for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the main lines of the North Plan were welcomed with skepticism.
The Pakistani leader, Pauline Marois, highlighted the North-Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to it, the liberal government, reaching power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had done so, "we would have made more progress today," said Ms. Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (srutin which is taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that it is not just a show," commented leader Sébastien Proulx, in place of Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (on irony) in Harper's office, who was allowed last summer to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "honte" for Canada.
In this way, throw the reproach on this woman who has waged an incessant battle for justice and who deserves all our admiration as long as the Prime Minister's siege and Stephen Harper himself.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated its resident in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no note of the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the facts that reproached him.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing the Geneva Convention, renegotiates its word and leaves a child soldier in inhumane conditions.
The only one who turns to a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us remind you that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among other things, is a petitioner for Omar Khadr's repatriation in order to benefit from a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes its eyes on torture: it does not care that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, no doubt ever after so many years of exaction.
We do not yet realize it, but we are now seeing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the word that Harper ceases to burn and that sounds so loud in his mouth.
This is the time when there is no more morality: one can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a head of government until the minority (which will then be after October 14 ...).
Many electors believe that they will find salvation in a party that proposes the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what was doing the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is here, in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech of Barrick Gold
In its September 17th edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of the Canadian mine barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellinian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company has attempted to continue a six-million-dollar campaign against three authors and a small publishing house without the sound in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of prosecutions for defamation, but the law.
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to ruin anyone or to support a position contrary to his own?
No matter the outcome of the trial, the authors and editor of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable amounts to prepare their defenses and fight, with very uneven weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets almost without the bottom of the mine.
The tactics, in these unequal struggles, are often to ruin the defenders in order to impose a regulation on the friend who will baililn the opposition in addition to defraying anyone who will dare to rethink the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in the public opinion that she should have presented her vision of facts.
Contrary to what is happening in many countries where Barrick Gold is working, discussions in Canada usually take place through the exchange of ideas and not at the same time.
It was therefore sufficient for the mine to open its books, its files and establish a real debate through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the funding of independent research teams that could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust the public opinion and rejects petition and letter of support to the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can both ask for a "public" debate while ignoring the views of the same public?
In the Vice-President's world, it seems that this word refers only to lawyers who are paid in a way that is not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or you don't want to understand - is that the audience that supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does it first because it rejects the brutal way of the mine.
This public is willing to hear and judge Barrick, but on the basis of civilized exchange of arguments, and not as a result of what many perceive as a continuation of the belloon (because of the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a stay at the site of the Black Canada authors urging them to stop using this term...).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's continuation is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It rejects, in block, the right to quote credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis for intellectual work.
If it is not possible to study and discuss topics that move the world's rich businesses into a country like Canada, without repeated prosecutions, who will do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so in accordance with the scientific standards used by the Black Canada authors.
She has a right to reproduce.
The university environment, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's unmistakable continuation clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she does not want a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abuse.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, have finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan aimed at curbing the financial crisis that has been draining Wall Street for months is still to be buried by both Houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: better control by the electors of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for default of payment, and a right to look at the salaries paid to the managers of the securitised companies.
The US Secretary of Treasury, Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to open up the real economy and ordinary Americans of the ongoing Wall Street crisis," the Democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: if we do not do so, traumaism, chaos and disturbances on the daily life of Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had turned to sprint in the last few hours in fear of the effect that would lead to a new failure on investors' mood.
The time limit that had been granted was the opening of the markets this morning.
In late negotiations, the two candidates for the US presidential election proved rather favourable to the agreement, but failed to express their discontent that they were forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has been awarded the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including that to allow owners to keep their home and the salary of the heads of companies rescued by the State.
"When taxpayers are asked to take special measures because of the irresponsibleness of some, there is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the waves of American television.
Questioned on another line to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied, "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The great lines that I have read show that this is something that we are all going to have to digest and with which we are going to be able to move forward.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700-billion-dollar plan aims to purchase, with taxpayers' money, suspicious, risk-weighted and inventable loans from US financial institutions.
It occurs after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the outbreak of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risk mortgages (repressed) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (CCAA) and triggering a liquidity freeze and the disbanding of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican electors who had headed the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed to be out of this impasse since the Democrats have accepted that some "toxic" assets of the companies in difficulty are provided only by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government had to make losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first instalment of 250 billion, to which 100 billion will be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion should be entered by another vote of the Congress.
In exchange for his assistance, Washington will receive participation in the securitised companies that will benefit him from dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to resell when the torture is past.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the arrest procedures for housing related to the real estate loan concerned and to set limits on remuneration and off-balance sheet payments to the managers of the affected enterprises.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives from today, and to the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have green light.
Votes continued to rise against this project yesterday, both in the republican and democratic camp.
"Of course, Washington doesn't mean you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Committee, at the address of his electors.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is to benefit taxpayers."
An animator of a small group in Congress named "the caucus of skeptics", the Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic professors, including three Nobel Prizes, have written to us to say that we are asked not to press and carefully examine the way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas indicated that it had refused to acquire its full-fledged competitor since it lost EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion) in the U.S. in the crisis of real estate loans.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty-largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"It is not of lost money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In exchange, there is a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It's just something that the savers and the households now appreciate that the times are predicting uncertainty."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Manche, the British government seemed to nationalize another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would recover all current loans from Bradford and Bringley, including more than 41 billion (75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the UK bank's branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon committed
His beauty in the azure's eyes was long his top card, some will say his weakness.
Was he released from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor to the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His power, his sensitivity, and a talent that flowed from the source will also distance him from the register of power that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at 83 years of age, from lung cancer in his connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the past years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he looked and which he had long been a kind of rival to the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of the freedom and break-up of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a Jewish father of German and a Hungarian mother of origin.
These European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No self-degraded, last quality mark.
Because in it was designed a whole country with self-made man, of the Pacific war fighter, wounded to the battle, who at the beginning of the 50s studied dramatic art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theater, television, soon to the cinema.
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the driver who ranked second at 24 hours of Mans in 1979, doubled by a six symbol, though a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow areas of this secret star, discreet, committed, allergic to the show-business cracks also disappear with him.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
The disappearance of Paul Newman has brought the dawn to the filmmakers this weekend, while interfering with his great role on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in permanent mutation shows through it.
Back in memory of Butch Cassidy's charming cowboy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejected his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a suitable burning roof by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we refer to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed at his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone to history.
This boxer, Rocky Graziano, guilty, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Someonebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hate), by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, again after his death, who actually launched Newman in 1956.
This pitiful abuse in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
Billiard player loves and vindictive in the magnificent The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), he will resume his character on the return to The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, which he valued in 1987 by his only Oscar on nine nominations.
That face through the ages was him.
He's still here.
The times are clumsy through its course.
Young people especially know him through George Roy Hill's famous Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a little orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers in 1994.
With a final role as a sponsor of the Irish mafia in the Road to Sam Mendes Lost in 2003, the loop was closed.
In spite of several legends of the film that soon set out, Newman will remain in the market for a long time, while reporting Hollywood, its gold, its stones and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not humourless, "as a challenge living in "underplaying" judging its performances to be too supported.
The profession has not always been tendered for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles have long fallen all the cooking in the bec.
However, it played less often the young than the marginals: nervous, alcoholic, salad or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected the derivatives and revolts.
As a director, Newman reveals some unknown aspects of his true puedic sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (after the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife, Joanne Woodward, in the main role, drew a fine portrait of a female melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated to his movie Harry and Son in 1984, working with dust and sadness.
Among the rains of men that flowed on Newman yesterday, his great partner and former gunmate Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the missing actor.
In addition to his career of legend, a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, Hollywood derivatives contestant also disappears.
We'll have seen a lot of his boutique troner on wine cellars, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of making bad tastes, though gag at the start.
However, the profits of these sales were paid to the Foundation for Children in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, he'll be engaged to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the course of an American artist so bright and so generous.
Citizen model, sum and up.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company do well in their invoice factory?
Next, on 8 October, the hearings relating to the current criminal procedure will begin against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
Politicians and their accomplices are accused of exorcism, in the form of a criminal organization, permanently and regularly, which has caused particularly serious damage. Other accused leaders have been held against them, such as, for example, false and false use.
According to the survey, the money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The state and municipalities' money, approximately 65 million HUFs in total, went on one side in the Fiatal Balldal and on the other, in the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the authorities responsible for the investigation, was to touch the money of the subsidies obtained by issuing invoices, after which no real benefits were provided and thus the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they were looking for invoices in the Józsefváros market, while they were manufacturing the caches in Kisunalas.
For the names of companies to be included in the invoices, it was decided, inter alia, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the deposit of the latter, he had to report pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model in which they made the other invoices they were going to introduce, among other things, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of Capital to access grants.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András Õri, who, according to our information, was mainly concerned with writing the files needed for the grant.
In a "perparage circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place provided the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
In the same way, in the summer of 2002, the invoice established on behalf of the Jobb Jöv Şért Foundation, which will then bear the name of Együtt to Harmadik Évesredert, made mistakes in forms and backgrounds.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, had in fact only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there. However, the bill mentioned a hundred and thirty customers.
The invoice issuers to the dredging image also fell into excess when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounts, neither the name of Job Jövʹert nor that of the Hoppa did appear, according to the information given in the parquet.
The manager of the company, Gygzz. Farkas, told the hvg.hu site that when the parquet summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed at a bad place on the cache."
He added: "Besides the form, the fact that, according to the bill, hundreds of people have settled there, did not fall there anymore, since this facility has only eleven rooms, which do not have so much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The issuers of zealous invoices have not been more informed about Budapest travel agencies, which are part of their choice, but are only organizing travel abroad. Thus, they naively indicated that they reside in Hungary on invoices to be settled in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency.
Moreover, as appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT to these documents, whereas the travel benefits, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Réfülöp Hotel in the order of Jobb Jövʹert was incorrect, since the company's benefits do not support a 25% VAT as indicated, but a 15% VAT. Furthermore, hotel employees only remove printed invoices, while the counterfeits were handwritten.
The survey of the parquet reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes by mentioning the transport of goods by road, that the invoice issuing company could not exercise, since its profile was the investment council.
In addition, it is also for vices of forms, such as types of improper invoices and false concealments, that the invoices issued under the order of Együtt a Harmadik Évesredert Alapitvány, of twenty-one. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont have proved false.
Just like in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehertó sports stadium, which both deny to be the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The counterfeiters did not pay any attention to the fact that HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group was supposed to take a meal at home. According to our information, that is why the company liquidator did not issue this invoice.
Invoices deliberately drawn up
Another category of invoice issuers is the composition of those who were fully aware that they were asked to issue fictional invoices.
The Esély Budapest Alapitván Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Balldal - Ifju Szocialisták group, has set up an invoice to the Együtt Foundation at Harmadik Évesredert, for a sum of four million HUFs.
According to the indictment, the manager of Colllab Kft. was brought to issue false invoices by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, he cooperated with the Zuschlags, Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices under the Jobb Jöv Şért Alapitvány Foundation, the Atlas Egyesület Association and the Association Vörösfenny, for about five million HUFs, but after which no benefits were actually provided.
No financial movement has taken place since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this has prevented the agencies from mentioning it in their accounts.
The following category of invoices companies is that of the companies directly related to the accused.
For example, the administrative delegate of the Director-General of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with fuel trade and motor vehicles, whose headquarters was in Budapest, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, this company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to around 18 million HUFs.
According to the survey, these equipment would have been purchased by Cash Investment Kft. from Kisunalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a Romanian-born man, to whom Iván Kubatov would also have obtained documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to the companies Atlas, Hoppá and Együtt in Harmadik Évesredert Alapitvány, and that he had blocked their counter-value.
It is precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian boys created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies worked, as the accused explained by the fact that they did not receive employment.
He still serves these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the company's founding acts, he has set up invoices on their behalf, in the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as the Atlas and Y-Generació associations.
Kubatov gave companies, 15 total bills, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The parquet thought that 10% of the sums indicated on invoices as well as VAT were in Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictitious invoices that were used in the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generáció and Szövetség in Modern Magyarországért introduced an application for a grant from the socialist party's public utility organization, Tancsics Mihaly Alapitvány (TMA).
They received this subsidy for a two-fold amount of HUF 500,000, but these amounts were not used for the objectives set out in the application.
To avoid this, five fictional invoices received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to the TMA.
Moreover, these invoices were found during the search carried out in the Office of Arpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants reported the method of manufacturing the invoices, as she had already done before the parquet.
What might be really interesting would be that the chief accused, János Zuschlag himself, decided to lift the veil over all history.
So far, his eyes are not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or, if so, the Socialists would have concluded an agreement that, in exchange for the repayment of a large part of the 50 million HUF, Zusi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is likely to be old-fashioned, as applications for his lodging in a supervised residence, on the basis of the relief of his detention conditions, are constantly falling into the ears of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much more damage, and the perpetrators of unreparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, wait at their own home for the end of the procedure.
Over-the-counter psychology: why do we spend more money?
In the course of sales, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the commodity.
Researchers in neurology and economics at the University of New York have been able to update the neurological and economic bases of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the Science magazine, human beings do not want to be separated during this type of competition, such as sales to auctions on eBay, and that is why they prefer to pay too high a price.
These research tried to develop a neurological scheme of this kind of "game" with the help of sales to experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was playing the lot, while the other group was involved in a sale to the gaming auctions, while with a functional magnetic resonance process (IRMf), researchers analysed the active brain areas of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants were able to earn money, but during the sale of auctions, an essential element of which is the overfill of a third, the whole being under the brain trunk, called striatum, was moving intensively during the loss of the part.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the "auto-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, the rise of prices is explained by the escape from the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers continued their analysis of financial surveillance.
In these cases, three groups faced a partner, under different circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and thus they did so.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they were winning the party, then they would receive 15 additional dollars, in reward.
While the third group received these $15 before the auctions, the members of the group also lost that money, in case they lost the auctions.
The difference between these two groups is that the emphasis was placed on one on victory, while on the other on failure.
By proving the hypothesis of neurologists, members of the team of players "against failure" were available to higher positions than those performed by the control group and the group "for victory".
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any already existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them did not explain the phenomena found in sales to auctions but by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only the methods of neurological imaging have helped to eliminate the contradiction between the two theories by now starting on a third explanation." - Andrew Schutter, professor of the Faculty of Economic Sciences at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when do we have to consult a doctor?
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
It is estimated that hundreds of miles of hepatitis virus carriers in Hungary, but only seven miles of treatment is followed. This is because patients often do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogens, are mainly propagated in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g., food or contaminated water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, it is strongly recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis A symptoms appear two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated foods, generally accompanied by a bad general condition, weakness, stomach and nausea.
Then, on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible yellowish, the cells become clearer and the urine takes a darker color. The healing can take two to three weeks.
Throughout the world, every year a million people die of the most serious form of this pathology, such as cancer or hepatic cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that according to estimates, only one patient in ten receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it may lead to a cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients are not aware of the virus because the pathogen destroys the cells of the liver in a subtle way. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular testing tests.
Pollution is much higher than the average of a population of three groups: people who had undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, 200 million patients have chronic hepatitis C in the world.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is recommended that you consult your doctor as soon as you experience symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
On 30 September, the World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004, was organized by the agencies representing the sick of the four corners of the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to the cirrhosis of the chronic liver caused by viruses, to the causes of its development and to the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God feel less pain?
According to recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of analgesic, which would have already helped to make the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
British daily Telegraph has published an article that says that researchers at Oxford University have made an interesting experience to analyze the extent to which belief in God could influence tolerance to the pain of the human being.
As part of this experience for the least bizarre, 12 Catholic believers and so many atheists were subjected to electrochocs, while each observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude a large part of suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experience takes place in the following way: an instrument that emits sparks and disseminates electrochocs is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to look at two paintings sustainably, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady at the hermine painted by Leonardo de Vinci in the 15th century.
Researchers from the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evoked a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of the painting of Da Vinci, not very different from the first, had a soothing effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an IRM scanner, and during that time received 20 electrochocs in four successive parts, while looking at either the painting on a religious theme or the painting on a more general theme.
The Catholics stated that in the view of the Virgin Mary, they felt as "safe", as if one of them were "careful" and they were "slow, and peace invaded them".
In view of the painting of religious theme, they reported 12% of their pain unless they looked at Leonard's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experience, believes that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in the athetes, provided that the appropriate photo is found.
"We should find an image in which they respond very positively, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, bishop of England, welcomed the results of these research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, effectively change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, there is no longer any question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if we show believers a Madone painted by Leonard or a painter of the same caliber?
Would the view of a better-quality Virgin Mary produce better results?
You're what you reveal about yourself.
On the occasion of his tenth anniversary, Google claims that it can be found at the bottom of the pocket of people in the same way as the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, which specialists they consult and which are their centres of interest.
However, it is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people in society.
While with respect to skeptics setting a parallel to Orwell's horror vision, they are not exactly seeing the essentials of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt, a short time ago, stated in the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary for Google's founders to be able to meet their original goal, which sounded as follows: "Let's gather all the world's information in a system!".
According to the Executive Director of Google questioned, after ten years of global smuggling work, they are still only at the beginning of their objectives of being able to process all the information.
To the question: What will there be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer such questions as "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What is my best job?" However, software will not be able to answer such questions simply in the first place, that the day they will know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all internet users that the words used during Internet research, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages then consulted by interested parties are specifically listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own research history and can consult what they have been looking for. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, the program based on the same logic, will be able to provide much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services based on our previous statements and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he sees what my work is? ask users, who are worried about seeing the monopoly of Google information.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can cause fear, and it is not the remorse, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the rebellion against power that can cause a counter-reaction among internet users.
However, it is confirmed that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in such a legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of internet users.
The most reprehensible example of these recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google sent to the Brazilian government the information he had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
In May, when Google, arms above with the EFF's electronic legal protection agency, was able to raise a sigh of relief, he proved his right to the court before the FBI. According to the judgement made in the future, Google will not always be obliged by any of the elements of the constitution to disclose information on the secret request of the FBI, whatever the nature.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 terms of research it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years ago. But ultimately, it has not been able to obtain the lists of private users' research, nor the full list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is fuelled by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of rebellion that they manifest against multinational companies proud of their conservative image.
During this time, the American geek culture and its "savage" bringing together the passionate enthusiasts, activists and users of the computer that appear in many countries see Google the next generation of big companies, the "connected corporation", by opposition to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as the world's invasion over Windows, and even though both fight for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that, contrary to Microsoft, Google does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The document code and the program package, constantly refreshes, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect in relation to the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that the geex see very precisely the problematic relationship between the rights of the person and the internet, and that the Web 2.0, the most widely proclaimed word in recent years, is precisely behind it.
In fact, Web 2.0 is nothing but collaboration, that we deliberately leave traces behind us, and that we use the communication channels that we have at our disposal, and while the size of these changes one by one, the essence remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and he can even link them to other benefits, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can link them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also keep blogs, where they automatically appear their most recent photo galleries that they store on Flickr or on Picasa.
While many examples can be learned, such as that of the little friend who easily understands the pictures of the morning, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company who fired one of his employees, nothing but for the sincere views that he wrote on his blog about top management, we can be on one thing: the term of private life is entirely to be considered today.
The person who lives an online life is made up of what he shows himself, and that is how the principle can be defined behind the behavior of today's young people.
He wants to hide something, or at least he wants to try to turn the Google monopoly, he can do it (starting with, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time leaving intentionally no trace).
The number of people who deliberately fail to register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them is not fewer. Google online services, through text processing to image processing, to read information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not connected to huge server parks and which do not resemble our best profile, which has existed so far.
Public opinion awaits, without really hiding it, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM $140 billion), Intel $124 billion or Coca-Cola $110 billion. AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threatens the number of advertising agencies' business, while the services introduced at an increasingly important rate give rise to serious migrants not only to Microsoft, but to many other software creators.
However, critical observers find, on the other hand, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the top management of the company has rejected, in its entirety, employee protests, after it doubled the price of the enterprise's maternity and after the company has considered it too generous the multiple daily restoration, taken at any time. All this seems to be depressing in addition to the fact that already in 2006, Google has acquired before the Chinese government and in accordance with the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the internal rules of the company, the new services are announced only when they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and next years, they will move the world on new points. While some believe that Google's book and magazine scan project takes such important dimensions that the company will soon face the United States Supreme Court, other tremors in front of its health system, as in this, we can build a full medical benefit from our previous analyses, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give a good primary material to the next generation of science-fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with half-tons of Orwellian, describes the future in which a man could be approached in an effective way only through Google data.
Two minors helped to eliminate the traces of the double homicide of Ozd
"The police summoned two minors to question them in the double homicide case of Ozd. According to the suspects, they helped to eliminate the traces of the crime." - said the spokesman of the Borsod department.
The young people have acknowledged the facts that they have been blamed for, and they are now being accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telecommunication Agency), are young girls, are free to defend themselves.
The complicity of murder can lead to detention of up to 5 years.
The suspect of Ozd's double homicide, a 23-year-old man, was placed in temporary detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old man owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and that is why he would attract his creditor, on Wednesday, in a site of Ozd where he killed him, as well as the little girl of this man, who was 9 years old.
According to information from the MTI, the young man predated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his crimes hidden in the crime scene is evidence of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the 100% purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish had made despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of the new potential owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wishes to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest bid made so far for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the manager of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the least good new owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could result in the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated to be between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance, with approximately 25 per cent of participation, followed by 14.7 per cent of the Ceská Sporitelna Bank and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, increasing daily, the European press's leading newspapers are already calling for a "second September".
"The global financial disaster, we owe it to the American President" - accuses the daily newspaper of Rome, La Repubblica. "The President has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised to the White, aimed at bringing relief to a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire Warren Buffett said, it is more appropriate to speak of a second September 11th.
A part of the Madrile press also sees the emissary loop in Washington.
According to El Mundo's daily vision, these are the shortcomings of the political leadership down there that led the world economy on the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system is increasing every day, and then the whole world is going to pay the high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, following the vote of the congress, a real dangerous threat, which Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just when in the history of capitalism, one of the biggest transformations takes place.
We can't ignore the threat any longer - highlights the Tags-Anzeiger de Geneva.
Some states may still have a life jacket for their financial organizations, and because of the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if more banks were to do so, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations would be sufficient.
In the long run, we need the European Union's states to do little about their national selfishness, and to centralise control over divided financial markets.
On Monday, the weak financial institutions received more than EUR 100 billion - recalled the Vienna daily Der Standard, which adds that the fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands to the pocket, very deep, similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really taken care of the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses, partly, the old continent.
The "saviours" should not burn at least one hundred billion euros, so it would be fair to note in which case it would be reasonable to touch the taxpayer's money, with the aim of preventing further damage.
The Smart Car Imitates the Flight of the Bourdon
What method would be better to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle if it was not the imitation of an existing obstacle detector in nature?
For example, the one with the bees.
In the surprising project presented at the CEATEC, which took place in Japan, Burdonant bees gave the strategic idea of departure to engineers at Nissan to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacles detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini robot, a bio-inspired auto-robotized system, of type BR23C, which has equipped quality bees, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
In its flights, each bee is its own space, in oval form, which, in fact, looks much like our safe protective helmet - explained, at the exhibition, Kazuhiro Doi, the director of the Department of Research and Development and the company's technological public relations.
The bee facet eye plays a key role, since it is able to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the face-to-face eye functions, engineers have addressed the idea of laser telemeter.
It identifies the obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 metres in front of the BR23C, it evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the ship's microprocessor, which transforms it into an escape route immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from a sufficient angle to avoid collision.
Unlike any existing system at present, this avoiding manoeuvre takes place in an instinctive manner.
"If not, the mini robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotized car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protection envelope, a layer where the collision is now considered inevitable.
All this process must reflect what bees do to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in a blink of an eye.
In contrast to bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of infinite combinations that have bees to avoid other bees, in our case, we were able to use only the rotating movement, acceleration and slowing as manoeuvres at the disposal of the mini robot
The BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and the concentration of energy is larger, making their life longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the intelligent instinctive reaction that is primary, not data processing, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism should only treat a few signals coming in a second, and respond to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on the data of previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilo-octets of continuous memory.
There is no need for memory of a giga-octets capacity, or even of mega-octets.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology used for instant avoidance. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will enter the serial cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its integration into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on his path.
We even gave a name to the baby at a price.
The written version of the $700 billion economic saving plan, which aims to buy the suspicious bank loans, and to use several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters announces that in the course of new debates extending until midnight, Saturday, local time on the east coast, Congress leaders have agreed on the ongoing conflicts of day and day, around the rescue plan of a total amount of $700 billion.
"We have taken a serious step forward" - said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, after which there is nothing left but to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born on the basis of the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
The U.S. Secretary of Treasury, Henry Paulson, said by commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. Pelosi said that there is no question, here, of the saving of Wall Street, but of turning the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday evening at 20 a.m., Washington local time (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., according to the local time of Central Europe), but did not cause a spectacular rise in the stock market.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill in the name of emergency economic stabilization law of 2008. Then its fate will be between the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the spokesperson of the White House.
In addition, the different programme from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which it mentioned that the $700 billion had to be spent only once for the purchase of securities on dubious credits.
In the meantime, up to half of the sum of 700 billion can be spent, the first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the Congress has passed the law, probably on Monday. This first sum will be used by the Treasury secretary to purchase suspicious bank claims, while the use of the $100 billion additional will be left to the discretion of the President.
The programme will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress.
Under the Law, the Treasury secretariat could put in place a combined strategy: it could at the same time purchase suspicious claims, questionable mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" claims.
The department's competent persons stated that the purchases may take place in the context of a sale to auctions, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to participate in an insurance programme, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools of concern for which companies will have paid an equivalent premium to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provided the necessary tools to spend $700 billion on the urgent needs of the financial system, that it was the vast purchase of suspicious claims, their insurance, or that it would avoid the risk of seeing the system leading to the collapse of one or the other important financial institution.
"We will take the necessary provisions to be ready for the application of the law as soon as it is signed" - he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders who are in bad positions and awaiting State aid can expect their starting allowances, called simply parachute, to be limited by the government.
The limitation of wages is mentioned only in specific cases. Moreover, the limitations depend on the way the Treasury secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The principle of ceilinging means that if the Treasury Secretariat purchases in the context of a auction sale, they will receive an excess tax on the damaged parachute, unless the disparity bank president participates in retirement.
Directly after the purchase of suspicious claims, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not exaggerated.
In order for the image to be complete, it is still necessary to add that the existing gold parachutes are not modified. The ceiling only concerns the new contracts, which is to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in effect on the appointments of the Directors-General - the chairman of the Committee on the Financial Services of the House of Deputies, Democratic Barney Frank, commented.
In addition, the State has a right to acquire shares in the banks taking part in the plan, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they may even be winning in the case as soon as the economy and with them the banks saved will fall on their beds.
The bill states that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal that will determine how the losses will be returned to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That is not why American citizens have sent us, this does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican Member of California Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague of Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that it is the same as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to increase
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month, and 12.9 per cent compared to the month of August 2007 - reported by the Central Statistics Office of Hungary.
Industrial export sales prices increased by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008, while compared to those of a previous year, they decreased by 3.9 per cent.
As a result of domestic and export price fluctuations, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to those of the previous month and by 3.2 per cent compared to those of the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices have only increased to a lesser extent: 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month.
The domestic sales prices of the processing industry were only increased by 0.1 per cent compared to July.

The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials have resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the manufacturing sector of chemicals and products (1.6 per cent).
This was the result of a deflation in the oil processing sectors (1.4 per cent), the manufacture of machinery and electrical equipment (0.9 per cent), as well as a minimal increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
The other sectors of the processing industry recorded an increase of 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which represent an important weight in the national industrial operation, prices have increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in the gas price introduced by the authorities since 1 July.
In a twelve-month comparison, taking into account the internal sales of processing sectors, these are the prices of the oil processing sector that have experienced the most significant increase (32.4 per cent).
In the metallurgical products industry, prices increased by 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food, beverages and tobacco production, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price reductions have occurred in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the production of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, price increases ranged from 0.6 per cent to 9.1 per cent.
In the whole processing industry, prices increased by 10.2 per cent during the past year.

In the production of consumer goods, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and materials producing sectors for subsequent processing did not change from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the most significant increase was observed in the energy and materials production sectors for subsequent transformation (16.8 per cent).
In the production sectors of consumer goods, inflation was measured at 6.8 per cent, while in the profit-initiating sectors it was reduced by 1.4 per cent.
The export sales prices of the industrial sector in HUF increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, while they decreased by 3.9 per cent over 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment fell by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro and by 7.1 per cent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it increased by 7.5 per cent against the euro and by 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that by 12 January, the American-Hongrois visa exemption agreement will enter into force. This is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to it, "now everything depends only on the time when the electronic systems of entry and control outside the Atlantic will be put into service."
She drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will return the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with foreign policy advisors from candidates to the presidency, Democratic Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank's rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama, as well as John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, supported the 700 billion-dollar government's rescue plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Secretary of Treasury.
After the marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, representatives of Congress and the Administration finally announced, on Sunday at dawn, that they had concluded principle agreements on the bank's rescue plan.
This funding plan, with the aim of defusing the Wall Street crisis and the paralysed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more fit than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, with the introduction of economic issues, Obama has again managed to make some progress. McCain's advance, with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a colister just after the Republican Convention, was founded.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly vote for the 700 billion rescue law.
He stressed that the proposal contained consumer protection passages that he also supported.
"It is now necessary to act, with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
There was no lack of qualification of McCain's economic ideas for overcoming.
In an interview given to the ABC chain, McCain said: "We all have trouble getting it down (...) but doing nothing is not a possible way."
The Republican Senator stated that the proposal mentioned the creation of a Treasury Control Committee and the limitation of the starting allowances of senior managers, and that it was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no role on the ground in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there was serious hope that the House would vote on the bill as of Monday.
The press review of the German language territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only in the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - it is also called the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
The mirror (spell.de)
In the online edition of the German Left Information magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic loss of the CSU in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this recognized politician, the erosion of the CSU began well before the sad Duke Beckstein-Huber took on his duties.
Christian Socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now these same modern citizens are turning their backs on them.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely to happen, just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU collected 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This was repeated three years ago at the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of the so-called Stoiber election.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization of "depleting its parents", established in the region consistently by the CSU.
This was 40 years ago when sociologists announced this, but they were very confused about the pace. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans in the north and east of Bavaria, in full development, could not remain unconcerned about the reliability of CSU voters.
Modernization must be combined with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right field is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more inclined.
It is also surprising that during the last few weeks, it is precisely the groups of classical citizens who have rather distanced themselves from the CSU, such as the independent, artisans, bacca holders and diplomats of higher education.
In these groups, CSU support decreased by 40 per cent.
The Press (depresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? The presidents of the party are on the reservation to the question of coalition", the conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of the confused internal policy that was installed after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ wanted to discuss with the conservatives of the EVP.
The EVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering with its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open for negotiations. Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
Elections took place, now all around the coalition; during public television debates, party leaders were hardly allowed to read their cards.
Werner Faymann, president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he would like to discuss with the OVP.
SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the OVP, as vice-chairman, remains open on the part of Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer direction was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of question.
Multiterer responded with caution to red proposals.
As he has already said, cooperation will certainly be fruitless if Faymann tries to get involved in the internal affairs of the ODA.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is currently a very open question, and these points must be debated in the WFP.
Jörg Haider, president of BZÖ, is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of reds and blacks, we are ready to assume government responsibilities" - said Haider.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, whose host is France, has begun in Paris as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party Fidesz, drew attention to segregations in education, because it is a violation of the right that affects the most Roma children and therefore one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MP Fidesz Popular Party, Járóka warned that, in addition to the distinctions found in employment, Roma disappear from the labour market, first, following their low qualifications.
"A overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have secondary diplomas, and as a result of an elementary education of poor quality, only a small part has the opportunity to obtain a higher degree of education."
Járóka also stressed that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role when it comes to asserting other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the member countries of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, there is a need to raise awareness of these reports in the widest possible circle, including between Roma and non-Romas.
Indeed, sooner a Roma child starts school, the more he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the State budget.
"Because of their nationality in the European Union, Roma must be guaranteed their right to quality education, and protected from low quality and sectoral education," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, cooperation from the European Union towards a goal and action is necessary for the immediate acceleration of the school disengagement process, and for this reason compliance with existing and preparatory anti-discrimination directives is of primary importance.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment; it is necessary to give the opportunities provided by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as citizens of the right to the future of Europe" - Járóka demanded.
On behalf of the European Year for Equal Opportunities, which is ensured for all, the objective of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which has been organised each year since the Berlin Summit last year, is to provide a unique platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination at European and Member State level.
CSU: Thank you for a transition period
It is in October that the decision on the fate of the Huber-Beckstein duo will be taken.
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the BAVAROS CSU summits has been updated.
The party president, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their place.
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a 17 per cent catastrophic loss, will be on the agenda of the extraordinary party's congress, held last weekend in October.
In any case, the members of this highly criticised couple felt that they were not particularly at their seat.
As a result, they have been used to soothe the angry members of the division and base, which one day after the "bavarois tsunami" have demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "only sovereign" of Bavaria, giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But conservatives are still very strong in this southern region, of key importance for the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced to coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the vice-president and federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, has also received a seat in this tiny recognition group, which initiates a round-table discussion with the FDP Liberals, as well as with the Libres electors, trained along the right values, regarding a possible coalition of the Munich government.
A strange nose of fate was that with the help of the list of Libres electors, entered the legislation of Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stroiber served as the possibility of pusch being carried out by Duo Huber-Beckstein, to then treat the very ambitious municipal political woman without a home.
Now, CSU leaders put all their energy to stabilize, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far would pull the hooks into the shells, will also be given an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, appointed September 28 as the most beloved day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber launched some quick remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
As a result of the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to be chancellored again unless they come back in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, when it is difficult to hide its disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of the CSU's land will not adversely affect the great coalition of Berlin.
What is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the socio-democratic crisis always lasts.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - its rivers : 110 - 0
No member of the opposition joined the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, which ensures its prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by the illegalities committed when the votes are dropped.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation made up of 110 people in this country of 10 million people has been very opposed for decades before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) would seriously hope that Lukashenko, renewing his presidency for the fourth time during the questionable elections, would "permit" this time the presence of some opposition MPs in Parliament.
In this way, ODSZ has given up its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, depending on Russia's economic growth, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where, because of the Belarusian political order called anti-democracy, Lukashenko and several senior politicians do not receive entry visas, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take credit because of the decrease in Russian natural gas imports, increasingly expensive, and thus contributed to the transition of Beltransgaz, the owner of gas pipelines across the country, to the Russians.
The fact that, during the campaign assessment, the OSCE emphasized positive changes rather than deficiencies, such as the ban on the submission of one third of the opposition candidates, referred to a prior settlement.
However, the OSCE communiqué on Monday was already challenging the campaign, during which the substance of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present at the time of the vote.
Despite this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have regained freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, always refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separately from Georgia. Or, Russia with which Belarus has formed a confederation on paper, considers the two independent territories for a month already.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step backwards, but the most important is that the dialogue has been started between Belarus and the EU," said Alexandre Milinkevitch in our journal.
According to the candidate to the opposition of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains, despite the fact that "the power in this parliament that has no weight, is afraid to make even one opponent enter".
The opposition does not provide for protests in the light of the results. Instead, it tries to get its message on the need for economic reforms from voters.
"Of course, we are very concerned about this: we have to print our opposing newspapers in Russia, the local authorities put us in the wheels for what is broadcast, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of older people," said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenko, which considers social security as its main result, the layer of the most officially supported retirements does not really regard it as appropriate.
"Because of the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'declaring the silence of a cemetery', is no more than a matter of time" - Milinkevich believes.
Unlike the opposition politician, the Russian observers qualified for democratic elections.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Independent States Community, told the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in acts." Thus, the absence of opposition is only evidence of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work."
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had there been no turning doors for the entrance and exit of the employees.
But from today on, this new measure against the small malts is in effect, against which it points and then drinks the coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-fraud novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration Renato Brunetta and the Secretary-General of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The Touring Doors-related Brunetta- is an instrument for better working, with more productivity, more presence and more services," says the Minister.
Now a new generation of responsibility and transparency begins.
"It's reformism" also stresses Brunetta.
The installation in all the institutions of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Palais Chigi.
According to Masi, "the choice of turning doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of employees has been recorded, the Secretary-General assures: "It is a process shared by employees, and we have had the cooperation of all."
In short, less breakfast during working hours; more coffee or growing.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is an excellent and healthy resolution."
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the Minister states that "in three months, the absence of public employees' disease has decreased by 50%, or 60 million more than a year."
And he adds that it is essential to make it more effective, the Public Administration.
Italian, "including wage dynamics," explains the Minister - these past 8-10 years have doubled in relation to the private sector, and in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees came together to challenge the rules of the Brunetta Decree, which applied to the Codacons.
" whereas the Minister of the Public Service today has the data on the reduction of absenteeism in the workplace for the cause of illness, the association of consumers - the people of "active workers" continues to increase.
In Italy, thousands of employees of the right and productive public administration met to declare war on the illegal standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in Tar, there is an objection to the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of an illness because of a service; the extension of the hours of the hours of permanent residence of the sick worker, during which the inspection visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Accidents on the workplace, Napolitano: "Creative Prevention"
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail's data confirmed that white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures testify to the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw attention to the institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic aspect, today, in all Italian provinces, today's 58th National Day of Labour Accident Victims, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of these last days, confirm the importance of prevention at the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, the National Association of Mutilists and Invalids at the Workplace, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the continued joint efforts to prevent job accidents, the protection of workers, the assistance of families of victims and the awareness of public opinion"
"naturally angry, everyone has hit the ping to put an end to such tragedies that, by their size, trigger the media cry and the participation of the public opinion, even though the daily reality presents us with dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano is hiding only "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
Many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to keep our attention to this phenomenon, not to evaluate the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini House stressed how much" this phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes upon all institutions, to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly."
The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths even impressive" said Anmil Pietro Mercandelli's president.
"We do not want this "tendence to the decline" to be translated into a minor attention, because it is precisely when the attention is relaxed that happens to the tragedy.
"we believe that in general, we are not done enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions."
"We have stressed that more controls and inspections are needed, as well as a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school."
- He added, "There is still an effort to communicate and raise awareness of public opinion.
"But above all, there must be a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that is a social emergency."
"Markandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the conditions of protection of the compensation provided for the victims of work" and the "derivative of assistance to which the system has been directed in recent years".
"The objective, therefore, is to give the worker the insurance guarantee – has he added – so that the fate of the person who has an accident should not depend on spontaneousism or the enlargement of the legislator"
Mp3 player with finger tips, they risk hearing.
Listening to full-volume music for a prolonged period using portable music devices such as Mp3 readers may cause permanent injury to the hearing.
This is what the European Commission, which, in a communication published in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on unforeseen and recently identified health risks of the EU (Csseri), published today.
"of this scientific report - we read in the note - 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full-volume music using portable musical devices, for more than an hour per day and per week, are at risk of permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that a large number of young people who often use portable musical devices and mobile phones in full volume can inadvertently damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific data indicate that the person responsible continues to be at clear risk and we need to respond quickly.
The most important thing is to raise consumer awareness and make this public information available.
In addition, we need to re-examine existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies"
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise generated by them.
"Scientists-concluding the executive U-Confirm that there are good reasons to worry, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable and similar musical devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of musical devices to 100Db, but the concern increases with regard to hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these data using solutions such as reduction of noise levels and exposure time.
The Scientific Committee Ue notes that users of portable musical devices, who listen to full-volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week, exceed the current limits for the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for extended periods risk permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This affects 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to around 2.5 million and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Germany ordered the Commission to leave for the future of capital.
Today we begin, in March we end, in June we will take the sums.
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Thermes de Caracalla.
Within six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they have finished, the Committee and the Community Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so as to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the " official seal " of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Germano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there - it wishes to stress Germano - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome, which will be used by political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Community Council.
No overposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a large project for Rome.
In March, it will have completed its tasks and will then disappear, as this experience must have a precise period of time.
In June-announce the Mayor - we will present the strategic plan from the work carried out by the Commission on the Future of Rome Capital."
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, given that its views will not be binding, Germany repeats: "All depends on the work which the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as elsewhere in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is cut off by the daily management and the time-consuming emergencies.
On the contrary, we want to see the future, and further, towards a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
Furthermore, the mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "this Commission is not a useless body or a bureaucratic set: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Romanian citizens, and will serve to study and participate in the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Germano, in fact, "a draft of strategic reference, whether firm or immovable, is necessary in order to allow our city, to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a united mind,".
A future that, as pointed out by the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the common frontiers, but will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president, that's why.
A famous U.S. politician who wants to pass independently wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the basis of his decisions, destroyed the U.S. economy and reported (as he still has today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
The attacks on Obama increase as the date of the elections approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition."
Obama is truly cultivated: he believes he will win the highest position of a nation that has two governors and five black senators."
In fact, these are attacks that don't say a lot; these are obviously racial attacks, and they don't answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have polls, which said everyone will win and have a good advantage.
In this case, it's still someone who talks to the heart and not to the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the suburbs of the south of the United States, wrote an article: once in the polling station, we know well who the American patriot will vote for.
This is what emerges from a aspect of American mentality kept secret until the end.
"Say what you want, we'll see ourselves putting the cross, Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things have never been revealed so far, so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were Bush's mistakes during his term of office? 89 per cent replied: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 miles of soldiers and was sent to her house at foot to fights.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to make the suitcases.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's weakness point.
Whoever takes George W's place will have an enormous task to accomplish.
Use, the economic breakdown is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is the time for deletions. And many charge the Internet, this "killer" of the newspaper paper.
Five hundred U.S. journalists were questioned by the POW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they have not openly declared information attachments, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a devastating economic model crisis.
In addition, the removals made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work at the newspaper assembly, are a major problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism is to be desired, as the general public understands, it does not decrease accordingly.
An obvious more complex pessimism invaded American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and press journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a bad path.
Locally, the executive group is 65 per cent.
Published against broadcast.
Journalists don't mind seeing where the web goes.
The largest publishing houses were spreading a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as the "killer" of the newspaper paper.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists increases to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to the technology hoping to "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest crack in American journalism is among those who run the newsrooms - that is, the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of managers at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is related to "working safety".
Directors who are planning to lose their 3-year job are 47% at the national level.
With regard to journalists, we're going to 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (nos editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a vast nation such as Usa, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and this quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
The directors receive almost always large salaries, while the editor can earn $10 million a month, in addition to pension and insurance payments.
With regard to holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days at all, passed a number of years.
But according to their revelations, U.S. journalists are often "damaged" during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA IS GROTTAFERAT.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaoud, decided to reject the estate agent Danilo Coppola, who had asked to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bank route in the framework of the Unipol-Bnl scale instruction.
During the trial in charge last week, he had obtained the release of the house transformed into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the real estate agent be able to travel from the province to a dwelling in the capital.
According to the court, such movements (which were not granted by the PM) would allow him to influence his company and have access to the evidence that he was receiving.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and it is even more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times yesterday that confirms that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided among its old East Coast soul, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and South States.
The soul, quite rightly, who felt despotically with the vote I was speaking to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is an example of the changes, of the major changes that the current economic earthquake pre-announcing or even leaving to run: not only in the United States, but in the whole West, and it can only be here.
In the United States as well as in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the phenomena that have been covered for some time, so that, in the new climate, they are strengthening and revealing themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the revitalization, the extraordinary resumption, of the dual category of sovereign state, compared to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions that, of course, have close relations with the foreign, but which, first of all, are largely involved, the balance sheets of individuals and families living in one country, in one state.
This creates an immediate political problem for the government: that is to say how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost national.
Political internationalisation really seems to be out of play, or it does not have much to say: the clear evidence is provided by the European Union, which, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, does not reach a common policy line.
And so, it is from the government of each state that everyone is waiting for interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a lack of credit: when we go through a difficult period, there is only the States that have economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements of which no market or international organization will ever have a similar availability.
This new phase of the nation-state crisis is of the utmost harmony with the ever-increasing importance that the most recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a sufficiently related factor: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, ever more sophisticated technology, non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we realized at once, that our future will have to settle its accounts more and more with rather little material things such as water, crops and oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another in the land, but which are absolutely linked to a limited space, to a territory.
So, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the evil to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now arrive at the second novelty, which, however, provides for a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably said Policy, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a gap for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved to be inadequate and full of shadow areas.
In addition, something deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discriminating, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
This increases the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far as they are apogée, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, having the same time, and being increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership, which feeds underground, is a powerful and branched movement of delegations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which occur in the "revolving" improvised electoral revolutions or, in the recent changes in collective humours, from the conservative ascension to Bavaria, to the fall of the workers in Britain, to the rebellion of American congressians against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy is not by chance).
It is felt that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their journals, their intellectual credentials, their format, seem to have more and more difficulty, which is not the day of today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and acts in a way that is potentially immeasurable.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda seems to be exaggerated.
But we say well, keeping our eyes open, that's not without reason.
The supercool to walk on the walls.
Vain the laws of gravity through a super collar and, in the future, walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring barely 2.5 centimeters square, the researchers managed to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
The U.S. Science magazine published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular structure of carbon, called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of the neck can be imagined as a series of pipes arranged as a spaghetti pile." Explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by geckos pads, covering microscopic hairs to ensure the animal, a perfect attachment.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the patches of these reptiles, and at the same time that it "is easily detached from the wall", explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton University of Engineering.
MARCHER ON THE MURS? –"This material could be used as a temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Could it be to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since nano carbon tubes are drivers of heat and electric current.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
For now, no superheroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH- Berkeley University, California, is also committed to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, California researchers presented a microfibre adhesion as hair, which cleans the dust during the movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Medicinal products: never with fruit juices.
Attention to the grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in the summer because they are harmful and rich in vitamins, if they are associated with certain vital drugs, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing, as appropriate, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices that they are, in box or fresh, if associated with the introduction of certain drugs; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: a glass of cotton juices, oranges and apples is sufficient to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, eliminating their beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
Pamplemous juice has already been strongly criticized because it is held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-staminal and neurological drugs up to toxic levels.
Medicinal products A RISK - It is the Italian Agency for Medicinal Products itself, which has given the news in a two-year information bulletin, warning physicians and patients not to be appraised of the risk arising from this mix and to be careful to drink, if you are taking medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
WHAT PAMPLEMOUSSE – According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit medicines.
Long is the list of active principles inhibited by pamplemous and other juices.
From there, Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmaceuticals of the University of Milan: "These findings are generally, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that need to change the information notes of the drugs.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the medicines taken, and, if something is not clear, do not get impressed, but contact the doctor or pharmacist clearly," the expert pointed out to Ansa.
The Nobel Prize for the Economy in Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize for the Economy was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neo-Kyennesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's solutions to the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman had written, in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first one, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that casts off many polemics, which has been reproached by the economist for years, but which has now proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a very aggressive-style distributor, particularly critical of the excess liberalism of the Bush administration.
Open Office, here's the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of OpenOffice.org.3.0's release, the open source of personal productivity that aims to touch more and more users, from house to office, professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a work of nearly a year, carried out by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package appears to the general public with various innovations: from the welcome screen, and the revised and less austerity interface, to other major ones, such as compatibility born for the operating system Apple Mac OS X, and support for the new ODF format 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007, and it is possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some specific functions on certain modules, such as the one that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphic processing module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
On this front, it is still possible to create "Hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format graphics with elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
The collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet, several users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the drafting of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are even working to perform some of the functions of OpenOffice on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should issue the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htm and is added to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also available as usual for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD may be shipped at home or at the place of work.
And if the theme of free can be a way to spread it in the home, it is just in business, that the Open Office then tries the big challenge, which can already rely on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Apart from the realities that provide a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Write, for the video equivalent writing of Word ; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the rival presentations of PowerPoint;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; at last Drwa is the graphic module.
Target for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are nearly 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, you can even exceed the expected number
Kohl also, it's positive, it's the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity in the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the best climber.
This is the website of the daily The Team that reports the news.
At 26 years of age, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, the third generation Epo, after Italians Ricardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl's trials are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positiveness of the Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and will have to wait for two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positive in the Third Generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, had notified the positive to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has placed himself on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, thus rubbing the finest gripper.
IMMIGERS: NEW YORK TIMES IF ITALIAN IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of immigrants has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" has been reluctantly welcomed.
Would this turn the beautiful country into a nation of racists? That's what the New York Times is interested in, which has devoted a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, referring to the case of young Abdul William Guibre, who was born in Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "north paradox": the northern regions are both the ones where it is recorded" more integration and more work", but also "a strong anti-immigrant feeling of the country and the most important support to the North League"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also referred to episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
Even the new legislation required by the Lega to stop immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
A trend highlighted by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, at his meeting with Benoît XVI in Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to conquer racism."
Students who are victims of cheap rent, up to 900 euros for a room.
The rental market for students did not know about the crisis
According to Sunia's latest survey, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects of the exclusion of whole categories of young people, of the right to study due to very high global costs that families of origin must support - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the strong demand from students has so distorted the market that a process of generalized growth has started for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also include a series of violations: free, unregistered, unlimited rental contracts.
For Sunia, special interventions through the tax revision are needed to calm prices.
In detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, about 450 euros is needed; for a single room, there is a minimum of 650 euros (Black Band area), an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, an average cost bed, 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the nearby areas of the University, it takes EUR 250/280 for a double bed, and between 370 and 500 for a single room.
In Rome, close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), around 600 euros are required for a single, 450 for a double bed.
Values slightly lower (550 euros for a single) for areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
It can only be saved if you move away in the peripheral areas:300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a simple in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed you need EUR 300/400, for a simple one, you spend EUR 400 to 600, with higher prices in the Polyclinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for bed, there must be 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where rentals are often taken by extra-Community students, have a further anomaly: the rent requested for foreign students is increased by 25/30 per cent compared to that applied to Italians.
Bye-bye to the old Paradiso cinema, the cities feed the historic halls.
The historical cinema halls are fermented in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinema halls is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image offered by the stagemaker Giuseppe Tornatore illustrates what is happening in the major Italian urban centres, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the periphery of large multi-rooms, and the death of the consumption of mono-rooms in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that seems unelectable and unquestionable to us; it also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical and memory-charged places, "it's like one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a piece of road and so much emotion," observes the director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, a film offering to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the jury of Cannes, who told the poetry of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia in a way of living the movie, lost can be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of traders, mean everything: these past five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and these are the rooms of the main cities that paid the costs mainly: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilie Romaine is headed with 82 single rooms lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the event of the multiplex, as these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-story cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardy over the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilie-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," observed Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it should still ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a room is closed in a city, these participants are not all necessarily willing to go to multiplex.
Without talking about the lack of credit for traders, the State's previous debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is a shame that, from a ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, between EUR 16 million and EUR 18 million per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned with these closures, which decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of which in Italy, to defend and promote mono cinemas in historical and peripheral centres.
Among the proposed regulations, there are tax facilities for managers and benefits for the mobile public: viewers will be able to enter the restricted area, and there will be special rates for parking and in certain parking areas.
"It's an initiative that please me" observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is obvious, however, that, in contrast to the superpower of multiplexes, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Paradise cinema" which I had been thinking of for 10 years.
I've been going to Rome for 25 years, and when I go before the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I've lived so much with shared emotions, I turn from the other side to not seeing the panels black by the dust.
Links between politics and ‘andrangetta, arrested Major of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to harmonise Mary's choices in the interests of the Piromelli clan."
Major and Deputy Mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrene, and Rosario Schiavione, and Mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for outside competition for Mafieus association.
The mannets also for Gioacino Piromelli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his little lawyer's son, homonymous of the boss, are already condemned for association of mafieus badgers, as well as paying 10 million euros.
"a face to legal and moral norms, and especially good sense," the prosecutors wrote, both local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay consultations to Master Piromelli.
"This would have been given to the clan - write judges - to officially enter the mayor's chambers facilitating the opportunities, already considerable, of control and orientation of the public administration"
The chairman of the Agazio Loiero Regional Committee of the Calibrian Regional Committee, hides only "collutions between local committees and organized crime, there is more than one" in his region: "there are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collision is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressure of the Andrangetta, the heroes who are honest."
This morning's arrests followed last July, after which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromelli clan.
By the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and always because of the alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their post of administration of the City.
Giorgio Dal Torreone, UDC mayor at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed head of a right-wing coalition, after the May 2006 ballistics.
He created the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the vice-minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, the accused of having handled the whole political issue, but in view of the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explained that the Piromelli clan had even succeeded in requesting the variation of the A3 project.
Due to the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrene, the PM writes, "the availability to marry the demands of a business man, a representative of a more well-known group, near the Pyromalli, uniformizing the public administration's choices in the interests of the clan.
When the energy is born of waves, now the big ones are released.
This is a massive rainstorm that occupys more than 70% of the planet's surface and now the world's largest energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colosses like Chevron have put their eyes, and now they're trying to put their hands on it.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years now, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil give a great boost to the sector
The London World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007, that 15% of the global electricity needs could be covered by marine oil operating systems.
This amount would be twice the amount produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides..
Colosseums on the attack.
The first company to take on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build an installation in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, we would have said a real no-revolutionary.
Two years later, more and more candidates among these companies have always been dedicated to traditional energy on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies" said the spokesperson of a company associated with the US oil colosse, the Wall Street Journal's economic daily, and it evaluates the possibilities of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question relates to obtaining a permit issued by the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to give rise to a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if it is considered that just in Alaska, the US continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which travels the way of energy coming from the sea, and the amounts invested so far, although their details are not known, indicate, according to observers, a growing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are still talking about technology at its beginning, on the other hand, because marine energy does not dissipate fear of the environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small and do not seem to create major problems in the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, however, technologies must be used with a higher environmental impact.
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of bubbles connected to each other.
The push of the waves, which moves the holes up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
Pressure causes a turbine to turn around, feeding a generator.
Energy is sent to the shore through cables under the sea.
For the moment, we have four systems of this kind in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and part of the energy could serve a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already producing energy for a commercial centre and parking using six turbines under the East River of New York.
The movement of water during the tides, turns the pitches of turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced having a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to power up.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electricity, deserves the potential of sailors at this time.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable of the wind, the sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it's just about the energy of sailors that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look to the coast, invested $7 million in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million in 2009.
