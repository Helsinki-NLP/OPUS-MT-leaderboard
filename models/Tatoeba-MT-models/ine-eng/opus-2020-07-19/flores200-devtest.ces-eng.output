This fact not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (this theory is already expanded), but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, for example, color and 3D arrangements.
Scientists claim that the feathers of this animal were castane hummingbirds with pale or karotene colored bottom.
The discovery also provides an overview of the problem of the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaurs don't have too developed resin called arachis, but they have other signs - paprus and hooks- researchers have concluded that arachis has probably evolved evolutionaryally later than these other signs.
The structure of feathers indicates that it was not used for the flight, but rather for regulating temperature or performance. Scientists assume that even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the pattern shows adult feathers and you are not young.

NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA agency, would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and thus save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions each year.
In comparison with ground-based radar-based technology, it uses satellite technology that enables air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater accuracy and provides pilots with more accurate information.
No extraordinary transport will be introduced, overland train transport will not be built in Wembley, parking or park-and-ride spaces are not available on site.
The lack of transport options has increased the chance that the game will have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
The study published on Thursday in Science describes the creation of new species of birds on the islands of Galapagos equator.
Researchers at the University of Princeton in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden stated that new species developed during just two generations, although this process was expected to last a long time, in view of the multiplication between endemic pence, Darwinian medium- and mobile pears, and cactus and coniferous pears.
Gold can be processed in all forms. It can be rolled into miniature pieces.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can bend and split. It can be torn or thrown into plates.
It can be processed into a considerable density and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it has been often used to decorate hand painted illustrations in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts".
It's called the pH of chemicals. You can create an indicator yourself using a jusa from the red green.
The vegetable from the green changes color depending on how the chemicals are acidic or saturated (alkalic).
The pH is determined by the quantity of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have been taken from electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry pills together and then create the balls with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with outer layers, which will result in a special feeling and it forms a kind of shell.
Harappa and Mohendjodaro had a complimentary toilet in almost every house connected to a sophisticated waste system.
The rest of the waste water management systems were found in the mining cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
The wests were also in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In ancient Rome, there were sometimes a part of public spas that visited men and women together.
If you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you use satellite calls.
Satellite in space gets a call and then its signal reflects almost immediately back down.
Satellite was taken to space using rockets. Scientists use space telescopes because the earth's atmosphere partially draws light and light field.
To get satellite or telescope into space, it takes a large rocket that measures over 100 feet.
The cycle changed the world in an unprecedented way, and the most important thing that caused it was the major simplification and acceleration of transport.
He brought us trains, cars and other means of transport.
Under them are medium-sized catfish, the food of which is made of medium-sized grain, from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-lived domestic cats), whose main share of food is a small crop such as insects, rodents, plazas and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the ecological system, i.e. that each cat has its own tasks that do not allow it to compete with others.
Lions are the most common cats, they live in large groups of called cats.
The bear is made up of one to three family adults, males and up to thirty females and adolescents.
Women are usually close relatives and represent a large family made up of sisters and daughters.
The lion’s nose behaves like a wolf’s or dog’s nose, a beast that is surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly for its own benefit.
Tiger can leap (even if not well), swim, jump to great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
Tiger belongs to the same genus (genus panthera) as lions, lions and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can scream.
The tiger's tail is not like the lion's tail, but rather like the words of sharp, screaming words.
Oceloti likes to eat small animals. If they have a chance, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals that survive are much smaller than he is himself.
Scientists believe that the eagles watch and find the animals to eat (use) according to the smell of the eyelids they know where they moved on the earth.
They see very well in the night thanks to night vision and they can move very quietly. They hunt in such a way that they cross with their surroundings and then jump on their prey.
When a small group of animals (small population) is separated from the main population from which they come from (e.g. when they cross the mountain ridge or river or move to a new island from which it is not easy to get back), they are often felt in different environments than they were in before.
This new environment has different sources and different competitors, so the new population will need different properties or adaptation methods to become a stronger competitor than in the past.
The original population has not changed at all, and they still need the same adaptation as before.
In time, how the new population adapts to its new environment, they start to look less and less like other populations.
Finally, in a few thousand years or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different that it will no longer be considered to be the same species.
This process is called specialization, which means the creation of new species. Specialization is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe, and they receive carbon dioxide that people breathe.
Plants produce food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothing from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant origin. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the ultimate dragon of his time, so he had nothing to worry about except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were covered with more than 70 teeth sharp as a beard and an extra sardine planted on the upper floor, which means that nothing that crossed his path would have the chance to escape.
We don't know for sure, but they could have a broken tongue, and their food included beans, big fish, other mossows, and maybe cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water. Even a large dinosaur, such as T. Reg, was no rival to them.
While most of their meals would not be foreign to us, the Romans had their share of special or unusual guests, including savages, pears, mussels, and the kind of rodents of the so-called dust.
Another difference was that women and poor people ate their food all over the chairs, while rich men loved to organize the guests together and depending on the side of the meal.
Ancient Roman food could not include food that came to Europe from America or from Asia until centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted the crocan.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a temple that was considered his home.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to satisfy the needs of the gods through rituals and celebrations.
Every temple had open temples and then an inner sanctuary, where only priests could enter.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, a special tower of pyramid shape called ziccurata was built.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family’s life was under heaven.

If you've seen the movie Treasure hunters, you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence, a map was drawn to the treasure.
It's not true, though, although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776". The text is on the back of the document, written up by foot.
Although the author is not known with certainty, it is obvious that a large pergamum document (sizes 29⁄4 x 241⁄2 inches) was soon after its creation of hundreds in role and arranged.
It is therefore likely that the entry was simply added as an opportunity.
Explosives in Normandy and subsequent battles have led to the liberation of northern France, but the country has not yet been freed.
He was ruled by the French "Vichy". These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invasion forces instead of the struggles.
On August 15, 1940, the allies invaded southern France. The invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces freed southern France and turned to Germany.
Civilisation is a particular culture, a common important broad group of people who live and work in mutual cooperation, i.e. together form a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", which means "civil" and it relates to the Latin "civis", which means "civitas" and also "civitas", which means the city or city state and at the same time defines the size of the society.
The pre-nations were urban states. Civilisation culture is characterized by the transmission of knowledge for several generations, the presence of long-lasting cultural trails and the proper dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the war for the independence of the thirteen states, it first formed a weak central government, when Congress was its only component, which falls under the Articles of the Confederation.
The Congress had a lot to do with tax evasion, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on law enforcement to state authorities that often failed to cooperate.
There was also no right to abolish tax laws and tariffs between States.
The articles called for unanimous consent from all states and could only be supplemented.The States took the central government at a slight level, so that their representatives were often absent.

Japan has nearly 7,000 islands and the largest of them is Honšu, so Japan is actually the seventh largest island in the world!
In view of the slum/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is sometimes referred to as a "island".
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when nearby European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, a beautiful island.
In 1624 the Dutch East Indian company creates a base in southwestern Taiwan and thus begins to transform the original crop production practices and employs Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 the Čching Dynasty units (1644–1912) took over the government on the southwestern and north coast of Taiwan, and in 1885 Čay-wan was declared the province of Рíše Ching.
In 1895, following the defeat of the first Chinese-Japanese war (1894–1895), the Czech government signed the Shimonosic Peace Treaty, on which it passed the sovereignty over Taiwan. It ruled this island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is created by three main patches: Intihuatanou, Temple of the Sun and the Town of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex were rebuilt to make tourists have a better idea of how the buildings originally looked..
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu was restored and renewed until today.
For example, the most common format of photography in the world is 35mm, which was the most common film size at the top of the age of analogue films.
They are produced today, but more importantly, their relationship has been taken over by digital camera recorders.
Although it is somewhat maturing, the 35mm format actually has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
So the ratio of the side of this format (twelvely divided to get the simplest ratio in all numbers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format family) are balanced or close to this side.
Often used and ridiculed "the rule of a third" is a simple guide that creates dynamics in the image while maintaining a certain order.
According to this specification, the most efficient place for the main object in the diameter of the wax which divides the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which acquired wealth and power, became the aim of a detailed examination.
After more than a thousand years, the Christian religion of the European States was united, despite differences in speech and customs.
His omnipotent power influenced everyone, from the king to the free citizen.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church’s money resources are here for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than 1,000 years. This concentration of power and money led to many questions as to whether this principle had been fulfilled.
Soon after the shooting, Britain launched the German naval blockade.
The strategy turned out to be effective because it interrupted vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally adopted international law codified by several international agreements from the previous two centuries.
Britain crossed international waters so that no ships could reach the entire ocean, which was also dangerous for neutral ships.
Since this tactic met only with a limited response, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine forces.
During the 20 ’ s, pacifism and isolation were prevalent among most citizens and nations.
As witnesses of threat and cruelty during the first world war of nations, they were eager to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take up work at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in a pocket, a book of poems and a recommendation letter for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (founded from the previous workplace).
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different periods of time; each time China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
Among each dynasty were the unstable period of divided provinces, the most famous of which was the Period of Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between Han and Xin.
During these periods, an unfathomable war took place among the many warriors fighting on the throne.
The Age of Three Kingdoms was one of the most bloody eras in the history of ancient China, when thousands of people died in the struggle to obtain a throne in the great palace in Si-an.
There are many social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absoluteism to republicanism and nationalism, or the belief that the country belongs to people, not to one ruler.
After the revolution, the profession was opened to all male applicants, and it was thus possible to succeed the most ambitious and successful.
The same applies to the army, since the military values based on class membership now depend on the capabilities.
The French revolution also inspired many displaced workers from other countries to try to start a revolution in their own countries.
Mohamed was deeply interested in the matter outside the realm of world life. He often visited caves known as "Hira" on a mountain called "Noor" (light) and there he contemplated.
The cave alone, which survived a long time, gives a very vivid picture of Mohamed’s spiritual focus.
At its top one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it, even if it knew it existed. Inside the cave is in absolute isolation.
There is nothing but a wonderfully clear sky and a large number of surrounding mountains. Inside the cave it is seen and heard only very little from this world.
The great pyramid in Giza is the only one of the seven savages standing today.
The great pyramid built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
Giza Plateau or "Gieská necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of Kings includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), small graves, temples and the Great Sphinking.
The great pyramid was created as an honor to Pharaoh Chufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wife and family members.
The label "top mouse" looks like letter V and "bottom mouse" looks like a sponge or a quarter missing by the bottom side.
Up means you start at the tip and click on the mouse, down means you start at the frog (where the hand holds the mouse) and pull the mouse.
The upward movement is just making a softer sound, while the downward movement is stronger and more provocative.
You can enter your own labels in the short form, but remember that printed labels have their reasons from a musical point of view, so they should usually be respected.
Feared King Ludvík XVI, Queen Marie Antoinetta, their two little children (11-year-old Marie Teresa and four-year-old Ludvík-Karel) and Queen Alžbíta Filipín French were brought back from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They went back to Paris with a carriage that surrounded the broken crowd and shouted threats to the king and the queen.
Dave forced the king and the queen to leave the windows of his carriage wide open.
At one point in Versailles, a member of a crime gathering was ordered by the head of the royal guard before the birth of the queen.
The military spending of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States in order to be reimbursed for much of the expenditure, with interest on gas bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the added value of long-term exploitation of the Philippines would be the basic result of American imperialism.
To understand the temples, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period during which events took place is commonly referred to as the peak median in European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 B.C.E.).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the early Middle Ages, followed by the late Middle Ages, which, according to most opinions, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice includes a wide range of ideas: for example, the so-called technology push or technological imperative, if any, that human destiny is governed by all-passing logic along with scientific realities and their manifestations in technology.
Most of the interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that significantly exceeds cultural or political influence, and that technology has a "effect" on companies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that when motor vehicles appear, it will necessarily lead to the development of roads.
The global road network, however, is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to an increase in road accidents, causing new techniques to be found in health care, how to repair damaged bodies.
Romantism carried a significant element of cultural determinism derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geographically formed individuals and over time, customs and culture related to this geography and these, because they were in line with the place of society, were better than freely invented laws.
Just as Paris is known as the centre of fashion of the present world, Constantinople was known as the centre of fashion of federal Europe.
His glory as an epicenter of luxury began about 400 C.E. and lasted for about 1100 C.E.
Its importance has been reduced during the 12th century, especially because of the fact that participants in cross-sections return to Europe vehicles of value, such as wheat and grain, and they had a higher price at home than those offered by the business markets.
At this time, the title of the capital of fashion from Constantinople to Paris was transferred.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and the 14th centuries.
At first, dress was significantly influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication, Western style remained between 25 and 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had started to develop its own style. One of the biggest advances in this period was that people started to wear buttons as a result of cross-sections.
Self-employed agriculture is a farm made for the production of only such a quantity of food that meets the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-esteem farming is a simple, often organic system using seed originating in a given eco-region combined with the planting of fruit or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In history, most farmers have dealt with self - help farming, which is still taking place in many developing countries.
Subcultures are similar to the thought-based entities that feel neglected by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ from age, ethnic origin, class, location and/or sex of members.
The characteristics of subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or combination of factors.
Subculture members often make their membership known by means of an express and symbolic use of a style including clothing, behaviour and hoses.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to extract from a number of unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident or intentional abuse, have not grown up socialised.
Such children are called "wolves" children. Some wolves have been imprisoned for a long time (usually their own parents have been imprisoned), in some cases they have been abandoned because their parents have refused them because of their severe mental or physical disability.
Wild children could have experienced serious abuse or trauma, with which they had been abandoned or fled.
Others claim to have been raised animals, while some claim to have lived in the wild on their own.
In complete non-animal animals, the ferocious child displays almost identical behavior (in terms of physical possibilities) as a given caring animal, such as fear or insensitivity toward humans.
While training based on projects should facilitate learning and make it more interesting, the method of scaffolding is still a step further.
Kostra is not a teaching method, but rather a tool that provides support to those individuals who are in favour of acquiring a new practice, such as using a new computer program or launching a new project.
The lesion can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a certain form of leaching, but also a small sponge in the Microsoft Office.
The software includes Virtual design designed to analyse, motivate and explain procedures that could be too demanding for the student itself.
Children are placed in adult care for a wide range of reasons that cover areas from neglect, bullying to exhaustion.
However, no child should ever grow up in an environment where he lacks proper nutrition, care and education, such cases exist.
We believe that the adult care system will be a safe zone for these children.
Our adult care system should provide a safe home, loving adults, stable education and reliable health care.
Pestonic care shall ensure all needs that have not been met in the household from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interlinked communication.
The specific features of the internet add another dimension in terms of usage and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialisation" are proposed as important motivational elements for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995)
"Personal engagement" and "continuous interest" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation by examining the response of obesity to the website.
The use of video recordings led to important findings in the interpretation of micro-declaration – motions of the face lasting only a few microseconds.
In particular, thanks to the correct interpretation of microexpressions, you can find out if your other person is lying to you.
Oliver Sacks, in his article President's speech, pointed out that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately assess honesty.
It even indicates that such human behavior interpretation skills can also be shared among animals, such as domestic dogs.
A study of the 20th century showed that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
Mutations add a new genetic variation, and the selection removes them from the given variation file.
The segregation and recombination mix in both directions the difference between the two files within each generation.
It is difficult to satisfy the need for amino acids from plant sources available in the open savanna for lawnmowers.
If he does not do so, it has serious consequences: growth of depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily available plant resources would be protein available in leaves and bouquets, but they are difficult for us to feed if they are not cooked.
On the other hand, animal feed (mravanths, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides a high amount of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Overall, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved a protein problem like today's champagne on the savanna.
Sleep interruption is a process of deliberate awakening from normal sleep and sleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This is easy to achieve by using a relatively quiet wake, which will bring you to your senses without being awakened completely.
If you find out that you're shutting down the sleep wake, you can put it on the opposite side of the room, which is to get you out of bed in order to turn it off.
Other options based on bioarthritis include drinking a large amount of fluids (in particular water or tea, known diuretics) before bed, as a person needs to get up and get to the toilet.
The measure of inner peace is the opposite of the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The smaller the tension, the better the life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Light can reach anyone. The only thing defending this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but it was expanded by the Mahayan Way of Love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are, in principle, very simple. They are the kundalini of yoga, meditation and the journey of alluring love.
In kundalini, the energy of kundalini (energy of enlightenment) is triggered by the positions of this yoga, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation center is Deity Yoga. Through visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleaned, activated cheques are activated and created with enlightened consciousness.
In the second world war, Germany was a common enemy, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. The focus of the system, processes and cultures led to the end of the war to break down cooperation between countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and started a cold war.
It lasted for another 40 years, and it was actually fought by the armed forces in combats from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to give up and regroup forces along the Romanian Prefecture.
However, these plans almost overnight took place when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops formed Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the soldiers attacked the eastern regions of Poland and violated the Russian Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Attributive Covenant and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using it to transport ships is far more ineffective than transporting large numbers of people and costs across the ocean.
The traditional task of the maritime vessel was to ensure the ability of the State to transport persons and goods, but at the same time it had to defend the enemy to transport its own persons and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. Americans tried to move men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this operation, mainly by means of the submarine.
If the Alliance did not succeed, then Germany would probably be able to win Britain, like the rest of Europe.
The skin was apparently first housed about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountain in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to behave for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skin.
The domestic goats were mostly kept in flocks that were crawling on hills or other pastures and frequently guarded shepherds, many of the children or those who are growing up as well as known shepherds of the sheep. These ways of pasture are used today.
Horsesports were built in England in the 16th century.
Although the shipping routes were mostly made up only of parallel rails, they allowed the heavy horse to reach greater speeds and load heavier than on the other rougher roads.
The rails were introduced relatively soon to keep the rails in place. However, gradually it was found that the rails were more effective if they had iron belts on their surface.
This became a common phenomenon, but the iron caused a higher consumption of wooden wheels.
Finally, the wooden wheel was replaced by iron. In 1767 the first railway line was introduced.
The first known means of transport was the way people began to walk exactly two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning a straight man).
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, did not just walk straight.
The twins occur in the Australope fossils 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
To a certain extent, to reduce future suffering, we can live more closely with the environment, join in the movement to protect the environment, and even become activists.
In many cases it is the same as symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not only have a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problems and get rid of them.
Clearly, the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological progress of mankind and the problems have increased as a result of the exploration and extravagance of human life.
After Congress was adopted on 4 July, a handwritten proposal was signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, sent a few blocks further to John Dunlap's printing.
During the night, something was produced between 150 and 200 copies, which are currently called "Dunlap prints".
For the first time, the document was publicly read by John Nixon on 8 July at the Chinese Independence Court.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July to read it to his troops in New York on 9 July.
The oldest known preserved copies of the document are called Dunlap Broadsides, or a total of 25 prints from Dunlap's printer. The original manuscript did not escape.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there's still a lot of signs on the birds that the dinosaurs remember.
They've got their legs with their caps and drawers, they're carrying their eggs and they're walking behind their two back legs like T-Rex.
Soon all computers used today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
The binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are given as binary numbers – or in the computer's giargon of bit.
Internal poisoning must not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to determine immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of poisoning may be the presence of an open container with medicinal products or preparations for home use containing toxic chemicals.
Check the description of the specific instructions for the first aid in the case of a particular poison.
The term break is used by entomologists for this group of gums in the formal sense.
This concept is derived from the early knowledge of dogs, which is highly adapted to parasites in humans.
As incest, the puppies are rubbed, adapted to life in the nest or to the dwelling of their host.
In contrast, the United States is known to have approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis, leading to an early neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system that consists of the brain, muscle and air nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have RS as men.
Some may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can decide on their child's adoption plan.
In the case of adoption, biological parents shall surrender their parental rights so that the parents of the child may become another couple.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works through scientific methods. This method is actually the guide of most scientific research.
However, it is not about experimenting itself. The experiment is a test that is used to support one or more possible hypotheses, but for scientific research it is also important to ask questions and observation.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, above all, the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all sciences, including psychology, were adopted.
As the knowledge of the speeches waned, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend mainly on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological hours.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only responses to external periodic interventions, have been documented in most living creatures including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological hours are self-contained oscillators that continue during the free course of the cycle even without the presence of external incentives.
Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used pheasants or viruses to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
Two experiments were carried out in which either the DNA was labelled in the pheasant with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the pheasant with radioactive acid.
Mutations may have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether the cells of the birth line have been affected.
In children, only mutations in the birth line of cells can be transmitted, while in other places mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-oriented tourism attracts people with an interest in visiting natural areas to admire the landscape, including wildlife and animals.
Examples of activities in this type of tourism: fishing, fishing, photography, bird observation, park visits and study of relevant ecosystem information.
For example, it is a visit, photography and learning about Orangutans in Borne.
Every morning, people in the cars leave small towns, go to work, and in the meantime, they are the next to go to work where they just left.
This dynamic navigational transport shall be shared and supported by a transport system based on private vehicles.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has driven the biosphere out of its stable state, which has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the company and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely encounter a similar level of complaint about the quality of water or broken bridges.
Why do transport systems cause so much complaints, and why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply not effective? Or is it more profound?
Transport is a study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between the two points and the interaction between them.
It is, unfortunately, difficult to examine the flow of traffic, as driving behaviour cannot be predicted with a degree of certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave similarly in a given range; therefore, operation usually has a certain reasonable consistency and can be approximately mathematically illustrated.
In order to better represent the flow of operations, the relationship between the three main characteristics was established: (1) the flow, (2) the density and (3) the speed.
These relationships contribute to the planning, design and operation of transport equipment.
Hmyz was the first animals to fly into the air, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid enemies and to find food and partners more effectively.
Most of the tissue has the advantage that its wings can lay back along the body.
This gives them a greater selection of small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Today, they are the only tissue that can't make wings, weights and tails.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed otherwise; the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), moved around the earth.
That sounds reasonable, because man doesn't come to see the earth moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It will flow more than eight times as much as the second largest river.
Amazon is also the largest river on Earth, in some places up to six miles wide.
All 20 percent of the water that flows from the river of our planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main river is 6 387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, pyramids in Giza were never overcome in size or in technical accuracy of the building.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire wept over the memories of their ancestors, who were then more than a thousand years old.
The Vatican population comprises about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the lowest country.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also a daily language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholic.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, since these elements are in nature in their form and are relatively easy to use for simple tools.
Philosopher Aristotle believed that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more than four communities of mass (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although it also theorized that it is changing into a new substance that creates what we see.
The rocks are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
The elements are like lime and resin, of course, but there are also metals as silver and gold.
You can also have stilts, which are part of a small number of non-combustible elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of mass.
Atoms are so small that they would be wrapped in billions at the end of this sentence.
That's why after she found it, she became a good friend of a lot of people.
Regrettably, with the existence of new ways of writing, it was reduced to lower position and later use.
People write messages on computer screens today, so they won't even get into contact with the clip.
A person can only complain about what happens to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The compact nuclear bomb works on the principle that to maintain the nucleus with a lot of protons and neutrons together is a need for energy.
It's something like driving a heavy car to the hill. Re-distributing the nuclear core will then release part of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable cores, which means they tend to break down in soft or even no contact.
The moon's surface is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the cross.
Kóra is strong about 70 km on the back side and about 100 km on the back side.
Under the sea it's weaker and under the mountains it's stronger.
On the nearest side there can be several months of sea, because the crust is thinter here. The lion could easily get on the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding out what people can say or are close to them.
These theories indicate that people have certain needs and/or desires that they accept during adolescence.
These theories are about what some people are motivated to want what they do and what their environment is forced to do or not do.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's pyramid theory needed and Herzberg's theory two factors.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can occur when managers start to lead their former colleagues – rowers. At one end of the spectrum is an effort to remain "one of them" (or one of them).
This type of manager has difficulties in making non-popular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, responsibilities and leading people to responsibility.
At the second end of the spectrum, a person turns to ignorance and feels that he has to change everything that the team does and do according to himself.
The leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This conversation often results in disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams respect the same standards of perfection as conventional teams, but there are fine differences.
Virtual team members often act as contact points of their own physical groups.
They often have greater autonomy than normal team members because their teams can meet according to different time bands, which their local management does not have to understand.
The unique component of the virtual team is also the presence of the so-called "invisible team" (Larson – LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The "Invisible Team" is a management team that is subject to each member. The "Invisible Team" sets standards for individual members.
Why would the organisation want to go through a time-consuming process of setting up a teaching organization? One of the objectives for the realization of the teaching organisation’s concepts is innovation.
If, contrary to the functional components of the organisation, all available resources are used effectively, creativity and creativity can be demonstrated.
The result is that the process of co-operation between the organisation for the purpose of overcoming the obstacle can lead to new innovative processes in how to serve customer needs.
In order for the organization to be innovative, its leadership must create innovative corporate culture, introduce knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains Continua’s approach as a method that organisations use to achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence of the theoretical approach to the examination of the cognition. This research area is so narrow and clear.
The scientist in their research supports the relationship between brain disease and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise in new technologies enables us to observe and examine brain structures and so far no unmatched processes.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that will help us understand processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong connotation with science fiction, it is a very important area of computer science dealing with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research of artificial intelligence includes the creation of machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent action.
Examples include checking, planning and designing, the ability to respond to customer's diagnosis and questions, the recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
Such things became separate disciplines aimed at providing solutions to real life’s problems.
The system of artificial intelligence is now often used in the fields of economy, medicine, machinery and military and is installed in a number of home computer applications and video games software.
Excursions are a major part of every subject. The teacher would often like to take his students to places where the bus route does not apply.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual excursions. Students can look at artifacts from the museum, visit the aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Virtual tour sharing is also a great way to think about the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina each year create a website about their trip to the city of the state. Each year, pages are processed, but old versions remain online and serve as albums.
Even blogs can improve the written statements of students, although their blogging at the beginnings is often marked by unbiased spelling, the influence of other readers will usually change.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blog writer is trying to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "the pressure of students to have an overview of the world around them". The need to stimulate public interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages cooperation and encourages students to expand education beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "allows students to improve their analytical and critical skills; students can define their positions in the context of other texts and formulate their views on matters in particular" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital of Canada, offering a number of art galleries and museums showing Canada's past and presence.
The Niagara Falls are also located on the south, and in the north they are waiting to discover the beauty of the Muskok region and others.
This and many others stress that Ontario is a foreigner considered a typical part of Canada.
Large areas further north are relatively populated and some of them are almost unoccupied.
Many people will be surprised by the following data about the population: more African Americans live in the United States than Canadians.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean on the East African coast.
Madagascar is far greater and from a wild nature we can consider it a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are connected to France and are known as luxury high-speed aircraft.
The Arabs also brought Islam into these countries.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese researcher Vasco da Gama discovered a voyage by sea (Cape Route) from Europe to India.
In the north is the area bordered by Sahel, south and west then by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all travelers be married, regardless of their actual family status.
It's also good to wear a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should remember that because of cultural differences, they may sometimes encounter difficulties and that it is not unusual for a man to watch a woman walking, catch a hand, etc.
Be steadfast in rejecting men and do not follow your own ways (cultural differences do not justify it).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the tenth century B.C.E. and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenida as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt the city under the name of Casa Branca and left it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan built the city on Daru l-Bady and the Spanish merchants who established their trading bases gave him the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping places throughout Morocco.
Around the old Medina is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as tartar, ceramics, leather goods, water smokes and a wide range of stamps, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located on the eastern edge of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by a lion from the Nyiragong forest, which buried most of the streets and especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside the city should be well thought out in view of the current state of battles that continue to be played in the province of North Kivu.
The town is also the base for the exit to the Nyiragongo sop and offers one of the cheapest mountain gorilla monitoring in Africa.
You can use the point (motorcycle taxi) for the trip to Goma. The current price for a short ride is about 500 congested francs.
In combination with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Timbuktu is a poor city today, but thanks to its reputation it is a tourist attraction. It also has its airports.
In 1990, because of the desert sand, it was added to the list of endangered sites of the world’s cultural heritage.
It was one of the main stops during the series PBS Divy of the African world, which was run by Henry Luis Gates.
The city is in sharp contrast with the rest of the country, because it acts more Arabic than Africa.
Kruger's National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of the South African Republic and leads along the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the southern border of Crocodile.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, each of which supports another type of wildlife.
It belongs to the main attraction JAR and is considered a flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Just like in all the South African National Parks, there is a fee for access to the park and a contribution to nature protection.
Successful can also be the purchase of a Wild card that allows entry either into selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The city of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, which many tourists consider to be the main tourist destination.
A survey of the buildings that make up the Hong Kong city panorama is compared to a triangular graph that is reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
You will get the best views of Hong Kong if you leave the island and go to the opposite coast of Kowloon.
A large majority of the dense city buildings on Hong Kong Island are located on the sea-based area along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists own, so if you're looking for evidence of colonial past territory, it's good to start here.
Sundarbans is the largest band of coastal mangroves in the world, which stretches from the coast 80 km (50 miles) to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was declared the World Cultural Heritage UNESCO. Part of the forest in the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove dams – among them are some of the last remaining sections of powerful jungles that have ever covered Ganga’s plan.
Sundarbans area covers 3 850 km2, of which approximately a third covers water areas or wetlands.
Since 1966 Sundarbans is a natural reserve and it is estimated that 400 tigers of Bengali and 30,000 pieces of Indian axis can be found in the area at the moment.
Buses leave the interurban bus station (through the river) all day long, but most of them, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since inter-urban buses are often full, we recommend buying a ride a few days ago.
Most quarters are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and resistant.
The shared taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Now 150) and Punakha (Now 200).
Oyapock River Bridge is a closed bridge. It extends through the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers are up to 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two roads with a width of 3.5 meters.
Depending light height under the bridge is 15 meters. The building was completed in August 2011, the operation was started until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational in September 2017 when Brazilian customs control points are expected to be completed.
The tribe of Guarani was the most important indigenous group in the area we know today as eastern Paraguay. They lived as a semi-negotiated hunter and also practiced self-defense farming.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as Guaycurú and Payagua, which were fed by hunting, collecting and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called the "Great Province of India", was born as a result of a meeting of Spanish residents with indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has been able to keep enough of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the field in Las Cañitas.
Small tournaments and matches are here to see in other periods of the year.
If you are interested in tournaments and where to get tickets to the field matches, see the Association Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the FKP, whose value corresponds to one British book (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the islands located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British books are generally accepted anywhere on the islands and in Stanley are also often accepted credit cards and US dollars.
On remote islands credit cards will probably not be accepted, but you may succeed in British and American currency. Don’t forget to ask first owners which payment method you can use.
It is almost impossible to change the Falkland currency outside the island, so make the change before they leave.
Because Montevideo lies south of the equator, the summer is here when it's on the north half of winter, and otherwise.
Montevideo is in a subtropical area; in the summer months there are normal temperatures above 30 °C.
Winters can be extremely cold: temperatures rarely fall below the freezing point, but together with the wind and air humidity, it seems to be colder than the temperature.
There are no specific periods of rain and drought: the number of precipitation remains about the same throughout the year.
Although most animals in the park are common to people, it is still about wild animals that live freely, so it should not be fed or destroyed.
According to park rules, stay at least 100 yards/metre from bears and wolves and 25 yards/metre from all other wild animals!
Although they seem peaceful, bizon, deer, salmon, bears, and almost all the big animals will have to attack.
Every year many visitors are injured because they do not keep the right distance. These animals are big, wild and can be dangerous, so leave their space.
Keep in mind, too, that bears and other animals in the wild smells, so avoid the transfer or cooking of aromatic foods and keep the camp clean.
The main city of Samoji is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upola and it has a population of 40,000.
Appia was founded in the 1950 ’ s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was an unfavorable maritime paddle situation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except one British cruiser were flooded, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During Mau’s independence efforts, a peaceful assembly was held in the city in the death of the highest president, Tupua Tamasse Lealofi III.
There's a lot of beaches in view of Auckland lying between the two ports, the most popular beaches are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour period) are located in the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay north to Devonport south.
They are almost sandy beaches with the possibility of safe swimming, and most of them are shaded with a slender tree.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are at the Port of Waitemat in the search districts Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
They're sometimes sloppy family beaches with a large selection of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", which is not a complex but pleasant and refreshing beer. The second local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that you can drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines could be a better choice.
Drinking water from the water is inconvenient here, but if you are afraid, water is usually available packaged.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" is foreign. Small black is "espresso", cappuccino is full of cream (not bean) and tea is given without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are even expensive, but first class.
Throughout the year, many trips to the utse and injury caused by some of these causes are rare.
So accept the advice of the authors, drive with the sign and pay careful attention to security warnings.
Four can be found near the beach and the mouth of the river from October to April north from the city of Seventeen Seventy. Sometimes they can be found even beyond this time.
The sharks really exist, but sometimes they attack people, and most sharks are afraid of people and they float away.
The crocodile is not active in the ocean, its primary refuge is the mouth of the river north of Rockhampton.
The booking of the accommodation in advance will assure the traveller that he will have his way where to sleep.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it is possible to book other forms of accommodation as a camp.
Travel offices usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even combined packages of the airport and the hotel.
They can also keep you booking if you need time for thought or for other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any adjustments or requests should be addressed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel address.
In the case of certain festivals, the major majority of visitors will decide to camp directly at the site and most of the participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be in the center of action, you will have to come as soon as possible to get a place to stay which is located near the music production.
Remember that even though music on the main stage may end, at other sections of the festival, music may continue until late at night.
Part of some festivals are special camps for families with small children.
If you are passing through the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as ice-creaming causes an insatiable noise in exposed areas.
Petrohrad’s environmental navigations include time in the city. Visa requirements are not applicable to passengers (see conditions).
Most casinos try to spend as much time as possible and spend as much money. Most of them lack windows and hours, often hard to find out.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment to keep visitors in good mood and in casino rooms.
Some devices offer alcoholic beverages on the company's account. However, alcohol abuse has a negative impact on judgment's ability, so all good players know how important it is to remain sober.
Anyone who would drive at high altitude or in the mountain range had to consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
There is low friction in the ice and snowed cars and therefore you can't drive the same as on the bare asphalt.
During the snowstorm, snow is coming up in a very short time to make it impossible for you to drive.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or flying snow or pollution or ice on vehicle windows.
Ice and snow are on the other side normal in many countries and operation continues without major interruptions throughout the year.
Safari is probably the largest tourist resort in Africa and for many tourists it represents a gold cemetery throughout the road.
The term safari, in a well - known word, denotes land travel for the purpose of exploring an amazing African beast, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and standard equipment thus enables a good view.
Lions, gepards and levharts are sometimes scary, and so you can better observe them using a remote view.
Tourist safari consists of walking tours lasting several hours to several days.
Paralympic events will take place from 24.8 to 5.9.2021. Some events will be arranged in different places in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two summer Olympics, since it was the host in 1964.
If you have booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay notice, this situation may be difficult for you.
The principles of event disorder may differ, but at the end of March, most principles of event disorder based on coronavir did not apply to July 2020, to which the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that inputs to most actions will be between 2,500 and 130 000 Japanese yen, while regular inputs will be 7 000 Japanese yen.
The ironing of the wet clothing can help him to taste. Many hotels have iron and iron bars available for borrowing, even though it is not in the room.
If you are not equipped with a iron or disliked to wear the radiated leg, you can try using a hair dryer if available.
Be careful that the tissue does not get too warm (which may cause injury or extreme burning).
There are many ways of purifying water, some of which are more effective than specific threats.
In some areas, it's enough to cook water for a minute, in others there's a few minutes.
Filters have different efficiency and if you are worried, you should buy water in a sealed bottle from a trusted company.
Travellers can meet animal pests they do not know in their home regions.
The difficult tissue can cause food injury, skin irritation, or in worse cases of allergic reaction, food spread, or transmission of infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can seriously damage or kill a person do not act as such in most cases between the pests.
Buying free of charge is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and other charges in the given areas.
Travellers travelling to countries with high taxes may at times save significant amounts, especially when purchasing products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco products.
The gap between Point Marion and Fairmont is moving on the road from Buffalo to Pittsburgh, as it often passes between isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving along rural roads, be careful: they control steep angles, narrow lines and sharp curves.
The maximum permitted speed here is significantly lower than in previous and adjacent sections — usually 35-40 miles/h (56-64 km/h) — and its strict compliance is even more important.
Interestingly, though, mobile phone services here work far better than in a number of sections of the road, such as the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German mowers are quite good, and in Bavaria they are rich and diverse, very similar to their southern neighbours in Austria.
Fruit cooking is common. Apples are used in cooking throughout the year, during the years then they appear sober and sweaty.
Many German baked products also contain almonds and liquefied nuts and other nuts. Popular mosquitoes are often suitable for a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to taste some delicious sweetness, you should test out the mucous membranes that are depending on the region called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
