Members of the National Assembly of Wales were concerned that they would be ‘compared to Muppets’.
The members of the National Assembly of Wales shall be assisted by a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a consequence of the plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ in ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name will become ridiculous.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP is ‘stirring on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for pop.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole was 'satisfied' and proposed alternatives.
One member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party 'open' for the name change, but note that the words MWP and Muppet look very similar.
In this context the Welsh letter W is expressed as a short you.
The National Assembly of Wales, which is currently in the process of drafting legislation to carry out the name change, said: 'Of course, it is the members of the National Assembly of Wales itself who take the final decision on their new title.'
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, members of the National Assembly of Wales were given the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be rebaptized to Parliament.
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option received most support in the public consultation.
At the moment, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will find it difficult to reach a consensus.
The legislation on reforms also includes other amendments to the way in which the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the system of committees.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote definitively on their new title when discussing legislation.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the amendment of their country's name
On Sunday, voters vote whether they want to change the name of their country in 'Republic of North Macedonia'.
The popular referendum was organised in an attempt to settle an intrusive dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's requests to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the People's Council on Name Change, said that he will not take account of the outcome of the referendum.
However, advocates of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, point out that the name change is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks of Saint Martin's silence, which Harlem's having it hard
“The older people I spoke to said that there was a café and a church in every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
Today there is neither a café nor a church to be found."
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
‘People now have other social contact,’ he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the district, where people regularly walk along.’
However, he is concerned that the proceeds of the sale of the assets of the churches will be less prolonged if the leaders expect, ‘and early or late they will be back at the beginning’.
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the type of people would live that would not help in the rest of the neighborhood.
‘The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be blank,’ he says, ‘which will lead to these churches being closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these flats will become members of the church community.’
Both churches were once built by a white church community, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church congregation of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church in the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church community led by Honorary John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott from the shopkeepers in 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks but rarely could get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building was seriously damaged by fire, but when the parishians of Honor Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a beaver.
Honored David Johnson, the son of Honorary Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, called the beaard proud 'the watches of the poor'.
The expert who played the beaard in July referred in another way to the instrument: ‘a cultural treasure’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first beaver in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger beaver of the Riverside Church.
Dr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and receivers, some rented by the lay leaders of the church, others by the church.
The Consistency (the governing body of the parish, consisting of laymen) wrote the bishop in July to express her concern that the bishop 'would like to calculate the costs' to the Consistency, although the Consistency was not involved in renting the architects and receivers who had sent the bishops.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the church.
Hail affects 13-year-olds who go to cancer in California
On Saturday, on the first day of the fall season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who died in California. The boy was injured, so it sounds.
The attack took place just 7 hours in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that on Saturday he had showered around half an hour with friends when he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with some others he pedaled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy called because he had caught a receipt, but then he realized ‘that the boy called out, ‘I prayed!
I've prayed!'
His keybone was completely open,' Hammel saw when he approached the boy.
‘I shouted that everyone had to leave the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he claims to be in danger of life.
It is not known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles told a press conference that a few weeks earlier a shark was laughing in the neighborhood, but that it had then been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured in the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and security.
Giles noted that more than 135 shark species live in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury wants to cross the British beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and direct beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in wholesale stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household items continues to decline. The larger beauty departments are tested in 11 shops across the country. If they prove to be successful, they will be introduced into more shops next year.
Investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the ranks of TVs, magnetons and interior items that once existed.
Sainsbury's wants to double its beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brand like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees also has more space, with exhibition space per brand, as in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique-make-up again on the market, now most products are suitable for veganists, something younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfumery will test the Fragrance Shop concessions in two shops of Sainsbury's. The first is opened in Croydon, in the south of London, the second is opened later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
As more and more people shop online and more often on a daily basis buy small amounts of food in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that the shops will increasingly look like big store houses, now the supermarket chains are recording it against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sale of food has increased and the acquisitions have produced more yield.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its departments Beauty and Apothek a make-over, it became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended when a conflict arose about the distribution of revenues from the pharmaceutical department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's are 281 apothecary departments in the shops three years ago for an amount of 125 million British pounds sold to Celesio, owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: ‘We have completely changed the setting up of our beauty department, so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our offer of brands, we offer everything we want, and thanks to the attractive environment and the convenient locations, we make sure that our customers like to buy their beauty products with us, and no longer shop in the old way.'
Peter Jones' anger after Holly Willoughby withdraws from 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of Dragons Den's stars, is "suffering" because TV-presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for True, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of this Morning announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is excited about Holly Willoughby, because she has recently retired from her profitable lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was angry when Willoughby announced on Tuesday at a difficult meeting in Marlow's headquarters, Buckinghamshire, that she did not keep enough time for True, her brand for homewear and accessories through her new contracts (with a value of another half million pounds).
The company is compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and would expect Willoughby's fortune to double 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave True, Jones withdrew to one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said: ‘Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would ensure her long-term future, and provide enough for the next decade.
Everyone was bluffed when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was soon planned.
The warehouse of the main establishment in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.'
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, as a result of the large investments in products from cushions and candles to clothing and household goods, and because the launch could now take place further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two sets often go together on holiday and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production.
Willoughby will soon become M&S brand ambassador and Ant McPartlin will be replaced as the presenter of the I'm A Celebrity program on the British broadcaster ITV.
A source from Jones' entourage said last night: ‘We have no comment on his business matters.’
Hard Language “Then Love Was Between Us ”
He joked about the criticism he would get in the media for a comment he made that some people would find 'unappropriate to a president' and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a new singer when he said,
‘I didn’t give up.’
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
However, negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have taken place.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, top diplomat Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not see a ‘consistent reaction’ by the United States following the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
In the meantime, the United States continues its sanctions to keep pressure on the chain, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
'We're doing very well in North Korea,' he said.
‘We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim led to positive results, the missile tests were completed, the hostages were released, and the material surpluses of American soldiers were returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
"It is so easy to behave as a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to gain access to this busy arena, about 200 people would be standing here," Trump said, while he was in front of the audience.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated an island with hundreds of deaths
In the wake of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their help.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had no more housing, there was no national disaster, which is a requirement for launching international aid.
‘In many cases it is unfortunately clear that they do not apply for international aid, which is difficult for us,’ said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is working with a team to travel to Palu, but it is not sure whether the aid providers from abroad can work in places.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency, said that Indonesian officials were still involved in evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to assist.
Although Indonesia is constantly being attacked by earthquakes, the country is still particularly badly prepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh shelters were built to slide at tsunamis, but along other coasts you see them rarely.
That there was no warning sirens for tsunamis in Palu, even though there was a warning of force, has probably contributed to the number of deaths.
It may also be difficult in ideal circumstances to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship authorized in Lombok to treat victims of earthquakes is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reaches the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's hareless infrastructure was one of the core points of the election campaign by President Joko Widodo, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the government of President Joko has a lack of funding, and he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also being pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority are now following a rather conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic bands were fighting on the street, with machetes, arrows and bow and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool provides impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge served Liverpool last Saturday for losing against Chelsea in the Premier League, with an objective in the 89th minute, during a game in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 metres from the target of Chelsea, at the time his team stood behind with 1-0.
He turned left against the ball and then jumped in the direction of the worst pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty zone, towards the top right corner of the net.
He invented the spring of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
‘It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible,’ Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Edge approaching and I tried. I didn’t really think about it, I just jumped on the ball.”
Chelsea was at peace with 1-0, after an objective of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The peaks of The Blues sped the ball with its whole to Mateo Kovacic, after which he rushed through the middle of the field to the play half of Liverpool.
Kovacic did a quick one-tweet in the middle of the village.
After that, he gave a beautiful pass, which enabled Hazard to reach the area of punishment.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alison Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the back pole.
Liverpool plays Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the group phase of the Champions League against Naples, at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea takes place on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London against videoton in the UEFA Europe League.
The deadly number of tsunamis in Indonesia is up to 832
The number of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832, the Agency for National Disaster Relief said Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that had fallen as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 last Friday, with also waves coming from 6 m high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of ruined buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman died
This morning a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 in Grayson Mews in John Street. The body showed stab wounds. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police ask the locals to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation has just begun, but I want everyone who is near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard a suspect request to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, in particular taxi drivers, to contact them if they may have filmed something through a Dashcam. They can have information that is essential to our research.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends came to think they knew the woman in place to ask questions about the place she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police have confirmed that they are currently bringing the victim's family to the attention.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment, but was told by the police that no one should be allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what happened.
The residents now hear that it will take hours before they can return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
There was a woman crying on the spot.
She just keeps repeating, ‘What's wrong!’.
At 2:00 a.m., two police cars were in the parking lot, and one third were just outside.
A number of agents kept an eye on the apartment building.
Those who have information are asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or make anonymous contact with Crimestoppers on number 0800 555 111, including log 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history' rail
The banning of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of the many cultural and religious objects of art performed by his fanatical puritanic followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Dr. Crick's suggestion as 'wash' and 'an attempt to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: ‘It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the visualization of the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclass of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the past century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that rule in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that many still have to gain recognition.
Dr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of the parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course the monarchy.
Or that it is a completely correct presentation, it is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure that represents one side of that hole.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and acknowledged.'
Murdered Pig Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, only known as ‘Yuan’, was found dead at a stable on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province. His slogan was crossed and he was under the blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to enter pigs at a pig stable on 30 May 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He and his nephew were supposed to have left the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door open to a neighboring pig stable.
According to the nephew, there was a large male pig with blood on his neck in the stomach.
A forensic study showed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the farmer, so the report.
‘The legs of my cousin were bleeding and mutilated’, the cousin said with the last name ‘Wu’, according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
Images of surveillance cameras show that Yuan arrived on the market at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal the man killed was not from Yuan or his nephew.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent the other attack, while the police evidence was collected locally.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are currently negotiating a compensation for its death.
It happens rarely, but there have been cases of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to get seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kg pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News demonstrated that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood aggression can trigger.
‘They are just games.
They're just kids, very curious... they're not about to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The tail of the Orcaan Rosa brings heavy rains to the southwest of the U.S.
As predicted, hurricane Rosa has now reached the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the south-west.
With a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a category 1 hurricane on Sunday morning at 5 o'clock, and was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to land on Sunday to the north.
In the meantime, it begins to form a fortress above the Pacific, which moves east towards the western coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed north-east, to the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will take 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical fluid that reacts with the approaching trunk will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the south-west in the coming days.
Locally it will cause 2 to 10 cm rains of dangerous floods, torrents and possible earthquakes in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to precipitation from 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
However, 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the south-west, especially above most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapid deterioration because the tropical rains can fall very widely.
It is most strongly advised to walk into the desert when the tropical rain falls.
The heavy rainfall can turn rains into desert rivers, and the weather will produce local winds and dust.
The approaching trunk brings local heavy rains to parts of the southern California coastline.
There are rains of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small torrents and smooth roads.
This would be the first rain in the region during the rainy season.
Dispersed tropical rains will approach Arizona on Sunday morning, followed by the rains at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue to fall on Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the U.S. can fluctuate strongly because the North Pole gets cooler, but the troops remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to major differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a fine example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the constant summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In a large part of the middle and east of the US, it is expected that October will start hot, with temperatures ranging around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the north-east.
In New York, it can become 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the chance to mid-October is high at above average temperatures in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people look at Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people look Thursday at one of the six television networks at Brett Kavanaugh's compelling testimony, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an attack that claimed to have taken place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, as regular programming was interrupted for the surprise of Friday: an agreement by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, was scheduled to investigate the prosecution for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee for Justice that she was 100% sure that a drunk Kavanaugh beat her and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Kavanaugh explained in a silent witness that he was 100% sure this didn't happen.
Probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen have been seen on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediate figures available for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble with the number of people who look in an office.
For comparison: that is about as for a playoff of a football match or for the Oscar release.
Fox News Channel, which supports the appointment of Kavanaugh, had most viewers during the day of the hearing: on average 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican stated that he would support Kavanaugh with his vote, the CNN and CBS cameras registered on Friday morning that the fighters shouted to him when he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Commission for Justice.
He stayed a few minutes with his eyes down while he was ridiculed, live on CNN.
'I'm right here for you,' said one woman.
‘Do you think he is telling the people the truth?
Someone cried, ‘You have power, while so many women are powerless.’
Flake said that his office had made a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various senders sent everything out alive when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote in advance with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee against the next week, something that the minority Democrats insist on.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democracy.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flakes' choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who were critical of her plans to leave the European Union 'a political game' with the future of Britain and the undermining of national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In a further interview, on the same front page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit. He said that her proposal that Britain and the EU should charge each other was 'absurd'.
Shooting Party Wayde Sims: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting party where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot to death.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and is in prison on suspicion of murder, said Baton Rouge's police.
The authorities produced a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses in the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA in the glasses, WAFB reports, a CBS television station.
The police interrogated Simpson and later declared that he had known that he had shot Wayde with death.
His bail was set at $350,000, reports the Attorney.
The bodyguard of the congregation in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the crime lab of the state police, the South University police and local residents have all contributed to the investigation leading to a arrest.
Sports director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for their ‘integration and pursuit of justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He won on average 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team 'kapot' and 'in shock' were killed by Waydes.
‘This is an event that you always hope will never happen,’ Wade says.
Fuller than in Mexico City
The ash emitted by the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of Mexico’s capital.
The National Ramp Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater was recorded and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
The center detected several times the volume and vibrations.
On social media, photos of a thin layer appear as on autorotations in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres south-east of the capital. This is the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a force of 7.1 on the scale of Richter Central Mexico.
The volcano, called 'Don Goyo', has been active since 1994.
Police listen to Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona Saturday after pro-independence activists successfully hit the opposition police, while thousands participated in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the independence vote in Catalonia that affected the region in two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists, who were opposed by the opportunistic police, sheltered the agents with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds to emerge in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, the police broke out of the shields, and the agents pulled their fists up to stop the fights.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sing: ‘Do not forget, do not forgive’, while their opponents shout ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they suffered during the protests, reported the local press.
The tensions remain high in the independent region, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters spoke overwhelmingly to become independent, although the rise was low and the people who are opposed to separation were the boycotts.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police had tried to stop the vote in the polling stations in the region, where it came to violent screens.
Pro-independence groups had camped on Saturday night on the spot to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration went on, but they were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who accompanied his wife in the separatist protest, said that he was no longer hopeful of Catalonia's prospects for independence.
“Last year we attended one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties won an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even though it was not, it was difficult for them this year to build on their success. Many of their most well-known leaders are absent, either in exile themselves or in prison, awaiting a legal case on their role in organizing the referendum and calling for independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old montour who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict by politicians was on both sides.
‘The tensions are growing upward,’ he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, declared that he is taking part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"A candidate for European elections is the best way to complain about the decline in democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after home was robbed with a car
Three men from 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after a car was robbed repeatedly in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday at 7.30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the doors and the building themselves had been damaged.
At a given time, a cross-bow was also fired on the car.
Livingstone wins with 1-0 against Rangers thanks to the goal of Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone was to provide them with the victory
The promoted Livingstone surprised the Rangers and worried Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 matches since he was manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came to the same height as Hibernate.
Gerard's team failed to win a race this season during the Premiership. They have to record the Sunday against Leader Hearts, who has eight points on them.
But first, the Rangers Rapid Vienna receive Thursday in Europe League.
The team has won six competitions in its department, and Coach Holt hasn't had any defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses chances against strong visitors
The team of Holt had been able to make a move for the first time. Their direct way of playing took care of all kinds of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a goal point. Then Alan Lithgow, who picked up Craig Halkett's ball, jumped the ball over the goal.
The home team let the Rangers play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances calmly and self-insuranced.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free step and Livingstone provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scored from the crime scene.
At that time, the Rangers had had a whole time of Balbes, but the defense of the household team was unmistakable and targetman Liam Kelly didn't have much to do yet.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure that Kelly had a goal to avoid.
Scott Pittman blew the ball against the feet of Rangers-doelman Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a speech by his colleagues from Livingstone.
They continued to reach the scene of Livingstone, but they were turned over every time. Twice a fine was refused, one after Halketts attacked the invasion of Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
Livingston's Phenomenal Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingstone.
They played excellent without exception and the expectations continue to exceed in their race to the top.
Their style of play and the composition of their team has almost changed since their return to the highest regions, but in particular Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has developed the team since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
The leader Halkett was fantastic, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were running during the entire match at the top of their ten.
However, the Rangers did not know how to break through.
Even though they played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they managed only once to shift the home team) and the Rangers will now realize that they need to play better. They are somewhere in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Keulen
Under a glowing blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went together on Saturday (29 September) breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne for the opening of a huge new mosque.
Keulen is the home base of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police stood up for security reasons when they asked the crowd of 25,000 people to gather for the mosque, but many sympathetic people came nearby to see their president.
Also, hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurden, gave their voice, condemning Erdogan's policy as well as the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The rival protests reflect the disunity of a visitor who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as a autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: biker dies after collision with car
In London a biker died at a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10.15 a.m. local time.
The driver stopped the car and the ambulance staff were present, but the man died in place.
A few months ago, another rider died in an accident with a plane crash on Childers Street, about half a mile from the accident of Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said that agents were involved in identifying the man and his neighbor's family.
The road is closed in different places, buses are being redirected and car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Cypriots injured in order disorder
Six Cypriots were injured in an order disorder in a severely secure prison for men, according to the prison office.
The disorders broke out on Sunday at around 9.30 a.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still in progress.
Specialized ‘Tornado’ receivers have been set up to resolve a situation involving eight prisoners in one section.
The cigars were treated place for slight injuries in the face.
One spokesperson of the Prisoner said: ‘It is specially trained prison personnel employed for an actual incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and in any case the perpetrators are being referred to the police, and perhaps we should continue to follow the trails.'
In HMP Long Lartin, more than 500 prisoners remain, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the director of the prison in the hospital was treated after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the riot police were called to prison for a serious order disturbance involving staff attacked with billiards.
Orkaan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with possible positive effects for drought areas)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that's exactly what's probably going to happen next week.
For Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service has already warned of sudden floods to the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and to the south-east of California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang just above Phoenix on Tuesday. Monday evening it will rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of Arizona border.'
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of impact, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the south-west of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Lakes, will probably get 3 to 5 cm rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
For areas not at risk of flooding, the rains of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, some of this rainfall will probably be favorable, as the south-west is currently going through a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought zones are indicated makes some more than 40% of Arizona at least extreme drought, the weather.com reported on one of the highest categories.
The path of Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland via the peninsula Baja California in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa is still in the hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north with a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits colder waters in the Pacific, causing them to weaken.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive Monday afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm in Mexico.
There may be heavy rains in parts of Mexico, resulting in a significant flood risk.
‘Average of a total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ weather.com reported.
Rosa moves north across Mexico as a tropical storm before she reaches the Arizona border in the early mornings as a tropical depression, which will then take place in Arizona and south of Utah on Tuesday evening.
‘The greatest danger expected of Rosa or her tail is a very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora, and the southwest of the desert’ said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains will be expected to result in life-threatening sudden floods and storms in the deserts and earthquakes in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsummer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was injured at approximately 4 hours local time in the Excelsior Terrace district in Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is 'stable'.
A 17-year-old, two- 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, so the police of Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh 'has been amongst the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the unmistakable and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment procedure, Kavanaugh constantly 'has been under the common, the anger' of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh testified on Thursday for Congress and publicly denied Christine Blasey Ford's statement that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified during the hearing on her statement.
The president said on Saturday that the 'American people saw 'the beautiful and incredible character, quality and courage' of Kavanaugh that day.
‘A voice to recognise Judge Kavanaugh is a voice with which one of the most complete legal opinions of our time is acknowledged, a lawyer with excellent status of service,’ he told the many advocates in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican appearance in the interim elections.
‘Over five weeks one of the most important elections takes place in our lives.
I don't take part, but actually I take part,' he said.
‘That's why I come up everywhere for great candidates.’
Trump explained that the Democrats are on a mission to 'stand by and block us'.
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will be expected to take place on Friday, a senior member of the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll is rising
At a large earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, with many of the land being swept away when giant waves fell on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered on Friday for a beach festival in Palu, when waves of about six meters high hit the country at the time it started to crash. Many people flocked and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake of 7.5 on the scale of Richter.
‘When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not walk straight away and thus became the victim of the tsunami,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian Bureau for help in natural disasters BNPB during a letter in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, he hit everything on the ground,' said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami was travelling over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people flock into a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
On air photos released by the disaster relief agency, many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges destroyed and destroyed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was swept away by shocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released at the huge earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that fell on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has even increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “great” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
Some deadly victims were trapped under the ruins of ruined buildings, he said, so 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could be even greater along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Dongala ‘is completely flat, we have no information at all’, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living," said the Red Cross in a statement. The Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
‘This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,’ said the Red Cross.
The organisation received a lot of criticism on Saturday because it had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
In amateur images shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building screams panicking at people down the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
A few minutes later, a wall of water falls on the coast and is built and cars flown together.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major flood that cut the communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo aircraft with supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuations still have an urgent need for food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city is open only for assistance and remains closed for the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Dodentol of tsunami rises above 800.
It's very bad.
Although the World Vision staff from Dongala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the interior of their office search shelters in tents of December, but passersby of destruction on the way, said Doseba.
"They told me that they saw many houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began with the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers could not travel to Palu with great expertise.
According to the Indonesian regulations, funding, goods and personnel from abroad can only be allowed if the location of a disaster is called out as a national natural disaster.
It hasn't happened yet.
‘It is still a disaster at the provincial level,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
‘As soon as the government says ‘OK, this is a national disaster’, we can provide international assistance, but that status has not yet been proclaimed.’
When the second night after the earthquake and Friday tsunami fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing people hoped that they would find their loved ones again, as in the miracles that people enjoy in terrible natural disasters like this.
Saturday a boy was taken out of a river.
On Sunday, relief workers released a woman who had been trapped for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students also stayed at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandadi.
‘As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional tax,’ he said.
Dr. Gendon said that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread into the paragliding community and that in the hours thereafter he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
However, only one gray angle appeared in his messages instead of two blue angles.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while supplying cash machine in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, 26.750 dollars were stolen from a Brink employee who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press report from the Newport police.
The driver had just put a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, so Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report.
When he was busy, another man walked behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was ready to deliver.
Several suspects were seen fleeing, so the press report, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the perpetrators is asked to contact the Newport police on number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name in Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: ‘It is that being formally known as Kanye West’.
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a short time and used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the course of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singers Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for ‘emotional reasons’, says the show's maker.
You are not only abbreviation of his current artist name. Instead, West told all that the word has religious meaning for him.
In my opinion, 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you',' said West earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album by Radiopresenter Big Boy.
'You're me, I'm us, we're us.
I was transferred from Kanye, which means 'the only', to simply Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are."
He's not the only famous rapper who changes his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced his preference this year for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has worked with and without the link and the letters.
Mexican President promises not to use forces against citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against citizens. The country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use military violence to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, military forces fired a peaceful attack on the square, killing 300 people. During that period left student movements took place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs as a result of unemployment and lack of opportunities to study.
The United States must double the financing of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research by A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He said this because of the announcements about A.I. coming from different departments of the US government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I..
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: by 2030, the country wants the number 1 to be at the level of A.I. innovations.
"Budgeting the budget for research into A.I. would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.," Lee said.
A duplication of funding can lead to a duplication of the chance of the next major achievement for A.I. in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Synovation Ventures, who invested in Face++, one of China's most important A.I. companies.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated the best player in American Othello, and later he was manager of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Google Department.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organised by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place, because it would help to discover the next visionaries.
In the US researchers often have to work hard to obtain public subsidies, Lee said.
‘China does not involve our best academics, the companies do that’, Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years acquired the best powers of universities to work with A.I..
Lee said that American efforts at A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“As a doctor at the A.I. level, you should automatically get a green card,” he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its artificial intelligence development plan for the next generation in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to employees of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Ministry of Defence set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and the academic world in the initiative, and the White House announced the formation of the Selection Committee on Artificial Intelligence (Limited Committee for Artificial Intelligence).
And this month DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, the US legislation which should lead to the establishment of a national security commission for artificial intelligence has been in the loop for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible change of name of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change in the name of their country in 'North Macedonia', thereby a dispute with Greece that has been resolved for decades and that Greece would no longer impede the Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province that is also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its north-east neighbour contains the country's responsibility for Greek territory, and consequently Greece has its veto against Macedonia's inclusion in the European Union and NATO.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and by a boycott campaign it is not certain that the required rise of at least 50 per cent will be achieved, thus the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot is as follows: 'Are you a proponent of NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece?'
‘Providers of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that emerged when the former Yugoslavia fell apart.
"I come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough Members have indicated that they will respect the outcome, which makes it decisive.
The name change would require a second-democracy in Parliament.
The National Elections Committee said that at 1 p.m. there were no reports of irregularities.
At that time, however, it was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent during previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voters in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the name change of the country that would open the way for NATO and European Union membership.
For Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents that were placed by people who had the referendum boycotten.
"We are the proponents of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can move to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European Asian integration.'
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will make necessary investments for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
'I am convinced that the vast majority is more favourable, because more than 80% of our citizens are more favourable than the EU and NATO,' Zaev said after delivering his vote.
He said that a 'yes' would be a result of 'a confirmation of our future'.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required occurrence.
From another painting, performed by the hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, it was concluded that 57 per cent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 percent would vote.
If the referendum is to be successful, the rise must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-western government's policy since it came into power in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and escort
Last Saturday Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short matches with Brighton's defense at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester. Manchester City won the match with 2-0.
It looked like a one-cent float, like Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian peak was given the ball played in the midfield.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, right into the open field.
There Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He knew how to pass a defender and was too fast for some others on the edge of Brighton's crime scene.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the crime zone to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat target man Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
‘Aguero has trouble with his feet,’ coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City told the press.
‘We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That was in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in Brighton's field.
He sent a beautiful stick pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball at his side and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player picked up the ball just before he was too far away.
City takes place on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. against Hoppenheim in the group phase of the Champions League. The match takes place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play and it doesn't make the Rockies easy to reach the playoff
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the play-off, there was not much reason to force a new start.
However, the always competitive Scherzer is hoping to play against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are other consequences for the participation of the Rockies at the playoff. They are currently one match for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least tried a game-off wild card due to their 5-2 win against the Nationals last Friday, but now they want to put everything else in the job to ensure their first section title.
‘Although there is nothing more for us, at least we can pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team is probably playing at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in it?'
The Nationals still have to announce who will be on Sunday, but have been told to set up Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would start his 34th, was in the field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although normally his rest day.
Washington's right-hand helicopter is on 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 inches this season.
Trump organizes a meeting in West Virginia
The president referred directly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while discussing the importance of Republican appearance in the interim elections.
‘Everything we have already accomplished is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections will take place in our lives.
This is one of the really big elections. I don't take part, but actually I take part. That's why I come up everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say: ‘We see a terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they're determined to take the power back, no matter what they have to do for it.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to push away to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "stand by and block us."
‘And we have seen that in the last four days,’ he said, in which he called the Democrats ‘evil and common and false and false’.
He named the name of the Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Committee for Justice, leading to a loud public call.
‘Do you know what she said?
Have you read the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.'
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant to people who say what they think
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
Finally, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour Members who get that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because they resolved against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motive for censorship because I did not agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on ironically enough similar issues as this one, in which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: 'we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.'
And that was the same during most GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I have been a local Labour Parliament member.
Unfortunately, today it is not the show of many meetings and the promise of a 'serious, softer' politics has long been forgotten, if it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a divergent opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is assessed whether or not it is acceptable for party management.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a similar political view as I did, suddenly expected me to turn around and take a position that I would never otherwise have agreed on, from issues such as national security to the European single market.
When I speak to a public, as I say, there are social media shackles calling for the rejection of my candidacy as a member of parliament for the following elections, which exposes the politics of the centre and tells me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I have more happiness than some of my colleagues because the comments to my address are about general politics.
I am impressed by the professionality and determination of those colleagues who have every day to deal with a flood of sexist or racist reactions, but do not be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of politics is that bad bad parties appear to be considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every ‘cause of mistrust’ or change of selection rules, the party is getting smaller.
I have often received the opinion in the last two years to keep me posted, not just to announce my opinion, and then I would ‘not be in trouble’.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since 32 years ago, as a school kid, I was a member of Labour, provoked by the neglect of thatcher's government, which literally disrupted my classroom, I have always prayed for better public services for those who need it most, both in my role as a council member and in my role as a minister.
I have never kept my politics hidden, not in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East was clear about my political positions and my disputes with the current leadership.
I can only say one thing to those who have promoted the motion on Friday: when the country moves to a Brexit that will damage families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I have only one message, which is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are now a member of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a member of parliament for the following elections or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting in accordance with what I believe is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unsuccessed Ayr on the way to the top
Two late trials may have pulled the final result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr is right to triumph in this great competition of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the classification, the only unlucky team of the ten.
Finally, it was both their superior defense and their better chances that the home team provided the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was pleased.
“We’ve had a hard time in our fights, and we’re still unlucky, so I’m a happy man,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose: ‘All honor to Ayr, they have made better use of their opportunities than we do.’
Grant Anderson's trial in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to an advance for Ayr, but by a yellow map of Rory Hughes of the Scottish National Team (which he received during the Warriors' match) Melrose was able to give up the figures and Jason Baggot was able to break down a trial.
Climo took care of an extra advantage for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solotry just for the rest. Thus it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match was a long time in silence for a serious wound by Ruarid Knott, which was performed on a branch card, and as soon as the match was restarted, Ayr could continue through a trial by Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then the leader Blair Macpherson of Ayr received a yellow card, and again counting Melrose with the extra man then no conversion followed on a trial of Bruce Colvine at the end of a very high pressure match.
However, the home team came back, and then Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he took Climo without the ball, took MacPherson behind the throbbing Ayr-maul for a touch-down on the penalty line-out.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did that almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and halfback sent Gregor Henry away for the fifth attempt of the home team.
Star of Still Game is ready for a new career in the restaurant world
It looks like the actor Ford Kieran is going from Still Game in the choirca. Apparently he is appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he himself acts together with his comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the next nine series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official data, he is the director of Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan was looking for a way to take part in the ‘blossoming restaurant business’ in Glasgow.
'The sea is of us': the country included in Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Zeeliui patrols in a seaman's office in La Paz.
At public buildings, an ocean blue flag is gunned down.
On all the marine bases of the Titicacameer to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
Throughout the country, Bolivia is still alive, as is the wish to preserve the Pacific Ocean after a bloody Nineteenth-century conflict with Chile.
This hope may have reached its highest point in the last decade, as Bolivia is waiting for a decision by the International Court of Justice, which should be held on 1 October after five years of consultation.
‘Bolivia has the moment, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the result’, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will look at the judgement of the Court of Justice on large screens, hoping that the Hague tribunal in favour of Bolivia will plead that Chile is obliged to give Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea after decades of good conversation.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who stands next year for a controversial fight for re-election, is much at stake with the statement of Monday.
‘We are very close to the return to the Pacific,’ he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the Court will probably not decide in favour of Bolivia, and even if that were the case, there would be little change.
The United Nations agency established in the Netherlands does not have the power to recognise the territory of Chile and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
That the judgment of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the conclusion states that the case was ‘not complicated’, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive outcome of Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, over the past four years, the situation may have become even worse.
‘The case around the access to the sea is captured by the current Bolivian government,’ Zárate said.
The warlike rhetoric of Morales has all the good wishes that Chile might have been completely undermining, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at a certain time, but it will be extremely difficult to talk later.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court's decision has been made unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will "be given an extraordinary opportunity to start a new period of international relations with Chile" and a chance to "end a 139 year of differences of opinion, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the maritime issue as a political crucible.
‘Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,’ he added.
‘The decision is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind us.’
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is not possible if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington cannot trust it.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the moment that State Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart the ongoing nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says it's a 'autopie' that the continued sanctions and the American opposition against a declaration ending the Korean war will ever get on the knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the statement without first putting important steps in the area of disarmament.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second summit meeting.
But there is skepticism and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious if he says he would reject an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to guarantee his safety.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge headsets, soon to buy near you
If you want to expand your watch collection or keep the sun completely out of your sight, do not search any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversized head coverings for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking set during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical guards were not thinking of Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their blinding creatures to the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a giant beige hat decorated with a square wide edge, hanging over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons possessed with precious stones, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
With many of the colorful masks, the lips were tighter. They looked more on Hannibal Lecter than on high couture.
One creature looked like a duke suit, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a molten ice.
And if you want to follow this stubborn fashion, you're lucky.
Stylwatchers predict that the huge guards will find their way to the clothing shops near you.
The giant shields may have been inspired by 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-metre wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a narrow beach bag that was almost as large as the model in bath pack that the bag accompanied.
The rhodoran raffia bag, set off with raffia francs and finished with a white leather hanging, was the most outstanding piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect the next summer big hats and beach bags to be in the shops. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the question of extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a number of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for continued and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects in excellent schools.
Nelson Mandela said, ‘If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot trust only in English when we want to build relationships and a bond of trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's exam, we can derive that languages are on the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
Data collected from 74 schools connected with SCIS show that 72% of students received a high score (“A”) in Mandarin, while 72% of students German, 69% of French students, and 63% of Spanish students also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now highly rated as STEM subjects (scientific, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
A 2014 UK Employment and Skills Commission survey revealed that 17 per cent of the obstacles to filling vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Thus, language skills are becoming more and more important to prepare young people for their future career.
Now more and more vacancies require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, when he has learned a second language, he has a real benefit in the future with such skills for life.
Contacting people from abroad directly automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage over competition.
According to a YouGov-pillar of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 per cent was unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. French was the only language that exceeded 10%, with a total of 15 per cent.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today's children.
Several languages, in particular those of emerging economies, will offer children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland schools themselves choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are the most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japan.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be different languages to choose in independent schools, with teachers specialising in this area.
Scottish independent schools set themselves up to provide a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
At the moment it cannot be denied that languages remain vital in a global business environment for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It needs to be done well.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut at the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans waiting for LeBron James' first match at the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening match before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It must be determined how many minutes he will play.
‘There will be more than one, and less than 48,’ said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James would probably play a few minutes.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked for his plans for the Lakers scheme for the six previous season matches.
‘At this stage of my career, I don’t need a race before the season to prepare for me,’ he said.
Periods of election rallys from Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, on a long series of election rallys
It is the first of the five planned rallys of Trump in the coming week, including stops in places related to him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now the vote on the appointment of the candidate he chooses for the vacancy in the Supreme Court is pending, Trump wants to build support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of Congress when voted in November.
How late does Trump's rally start in West Virginia tonight and how are you looking online?
The rally of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19 o'clock.
You can view Trumps rally in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably have the hearings for the candidate-up judge Brett Kavanaugh this week. These were additionally charged now Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this series of rallys is to help the republics that are candidates for the elections in November to get more of it.
President Trump's campaign leader said that the following week these five rallys were intended to ‘stimulate volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives’, i.e. Reuters.
‘Congress control is so important for its programme that the president travels to as many states as possible to start the press campaign season’, said a spokesman for the Trump campaign that did not want to be mentioned against Reuters.
The rally of tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and are discussed in the media of Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the stakes.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a boost in the stakes," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep the hope alive in the run to the singles of Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The dazzling ranger of opportunities is a fully invented sport concept, but a true where players really believe, and especially in competitions like this one.
So who's getting the best chances right now?
“They had a lead of six points first, and now that’s four more, so we think that happiness is so little on our side at the moment,” said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of standing four points, while there are 12 still in play.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each three points of the four.
Speeth has been a fearsome opponent of tea to green and he sets the right example.
The typical vocal sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his rounds progressed and he achieved a crucial pot with four successful matches when he and Thomas were behind two points after two matches.
His post, with which she won the 15th race, was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can draw that he believes that the American team has not yet been reported.
"You have to dig deep and just worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all these players can do right now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable but glorious European duo has four to four and can do nothing wrong.
‘Moliwood’ was the only duo that no bogey played Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogeys.
As a result of that series, and the way in which they seem to share energy with their curious audience, they are the players that should be reported Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will ever be the most popular player who will win a European victory when the sun goes over Le Golf National.
Both prefer different holes at the same time.
However, it is a caution to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short matches with Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of that morning, when he made a duo with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles on the front of the Nine led to a retreat for the Spaniard and the Swedish that they did not get over.
Sunday, however, there's no one who can help get your back.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duo's, the opinion they give, the opinion they don't give, and the way in which a strategy can be changed.
So far, the European team has played its best and has a great lead in the course of the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, something that some, especially in the US, have doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe begins with a great lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and four-balls of Saturday they stand in the United States with 10-6.
The seasoned duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, which had a hard time, and they now have four points in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, that the trophy they wanted to lose in Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the stunning Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two matches, but could no longer get back.
The team of Jim Furyk has to score eight points during the 12 singles games of Sunday in order to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points on row, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname ‘Mollwood’ after a sensational weekend, are the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup that wins four points in their four opening competitions.
After they had joined Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were wonderfully played together and defeated a disappointing Woods and American novelist Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who went through two games on Saturday, showed off a beautiful set, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and four-somes and seven on row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
However, it was not a leased roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas, with three points, set the standard for the Americans on Saturday.
They won 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes after they lost the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to pick up a set of four points at the start of the singles, although the team of Fury has enough of the same game, as they currently have the trophy in their hands.
But now that they've been in second place for two days, it seems that an attack on Sunday seems too high.
North Korea says it's going to unarm one side without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions lead to increasing distrust in the United States and that the country would not be able to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations Annual General Meeting that North Korea had taken 'significant goodwill measures' in recent years, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, disarming the location for nuclear tests and the promise not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
‘But we do not see a corresponding response from the US,’ he said.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will not be able to disarm ourselves unilaterally."
Although Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about the ban on a ‘phased’ approach to denouncing, which would reward North Korea as the next step, it suggested that he did not reject unilateral denounization a priori, as Pyongyang did earlier.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on the 'declaration of the Korean peninsula' while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up his nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted the call for strong international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on 'denomination first' and increases the pressure by means of sanctions in order to achieve their purpose in a forceful way and even object to the 'declaration of the end of war'," Ri said.
‘The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an air castle of people who are unaware of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions will only strengthen our confidence.'
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit meeting between Kim and Trump, which the American leader did earlier in the week at the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: ‘If the other party on this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an impasse.’
However, Ri's speech was significantly different from last year, when he said to the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean rockets on the US continent would be directed after 'Mr Evil President' Trump called 'a rocketman' on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea completely last year, praised Kim this year at the United Nations for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that there should be much to do and that sanctions should continue to denounize North Korea.
Wednesday Trump said he had no schedule for this: ‘Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.’
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council must reward the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: 'The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must be continued strongly and firmly until we have achieved the complete, final, verified denouncing.'
Since 2006, the Security Council has imposed unanimous sanctions against North Korea to reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit meeting.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Almost an hour after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, North Korea told him to set 'traffic requirements'.
North Korea promised this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantle a rocket site and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take 'agreed measures'.
He said that Kim had told him that the 'agreed measures' he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and were taking steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course on the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to fight the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
One professor found that the students of the world's largest university often had no idea of the basic principles to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist associated with the Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course. For as far as he knows, this is unique in the US.
He got the idea to start with the course after giving a talk about the influence of sleeplessness on learning.
'At the end of my speech, a girl came to me saying, 'Why am I getting to hear this now, in my last year?'
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, which surprised me, he said to The Telegraph.
In the course, which is organised this year for the first time, students are given the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performances and how they promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the health services of the university, said the university decided to organize the course when it was determined that students had a serious sleep deficit during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections, the students see a picture of a bedroom, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercises and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performances are influenced by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine in sleeping.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
By means of a flat ground of the campus, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think that they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know the effects of the choice of cigarettes on their health, Ceisler added.
The culture of celebration on one night still exists, he says, and due to modern technology and increasing pressure on students is a growing problem in the short term.
Worrying for sufficient sleep, of good quality, the student's 'secret weapon' must be to fight stress, fatigue and fear, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation ensures that the brain gives them a constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to develop the course. He had learned from the professor when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to everyone on the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study programme before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set up an alarm for their bedtime, and not just an alarm to stand up. They also need to be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can trigger your circadian rhythm, making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Target of Menga makes men of Gerrard go down
The Rangers saw their race run again disappointingly when Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak team defeated 1-0 in Livingstone.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first victory during a race since they defeated St Johnstone with 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team took care of the defeat, almost the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 matches. His team now has eight points behind Hearts, which continue to run at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes for rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equal player.
The Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingstone rises to the third, with only a difference in the number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get even more problems, as border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a major necessity after apparently an object was thrown to him by the supporters of the visiting team.
Gerard made eight changes in his team. They stopped Ayr and went to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt remained at the same eleven for Livingstone, who knew a point to cut off the Hearts last week. He would have been up on the way his well-trained team would have managed to block the opponents at each set.
The Rangers may have had the most Balbes, but Livingstone did more.
They had to score after two minutes, when Menga released the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the vision, but the midfield could not finish it.
A deep free step by Keaghan Jacobs reached the leader Craig Halkett, but his colleague-defender Alan Lithgow jumped against the rear pole.
The Rangers did manage to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than believe in it if they could approach the target.
Alfredo Morelos found himself entitled to a fine when he and Steven Lawless were fighting after a quarter, but Judge Steven Thomson denied the Colombian request.
The Rangers were only able to shoot twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was a target man at the Ibrox, was able to withstand Lassana Coulibally's headball and Ovie Ejaria's small shot with ease.
The opening of Livingstone in the 34th minute may or may not be in the extension of the general game course, no one can deny that they deserved this, although it was only for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were not raised against Jacobs' deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball on to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-blooded and chosen Menga, who easily hit the ball.
Gerard took care of a break with the change Coulibally/Ryan Kent. This set had almost immediate effects when the wing player passed Morelos, but an impressive Kelly race from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston kept the visitors forced to play a kind of game that Livingstone likes to play, with Lithgov and Halkett standing long balls.
Holt's team was able to increase its lead in the final stage of the match, but McGregor stood well and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came from the corner.
Invaller Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked for a sentence after an invasion with Jacobs at the end of the match, but Thomson looked the other way.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from the Almanac of our 'Sunday Morning': 30 September 1882, today just 136 years ago, for whom can you TELLEEN... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm 'Hans' Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device with the name Geigerteller.
Since then, the geigert has not been thinking about science, and has also become an icon in pop culture, for example in 'Bells or Coronado', a 1950 film with the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘What in the hell is that?’
Rogers: ‘This is a geigert. It is used to trace radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set up this headphone, you will hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.'
Evans: ‘It’s a real joke now!’
'Hans' Geiger died in 1945, almost a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ harmful cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ and kill malicious cells
Vaccine teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells as part of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to convert them into a laboratory
They can then see a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and are then injected again.
A test vaccine delivers promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells saw her ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method removes immune cells in a patient, then adjusts the cells in the lab so that they can ‘see’ the HER2 protein, which often occurs in various types of cancer. Then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and intestinal cancer, professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and ‘learn these cells’ to treat cancer cells was to work in the treatment of a particular type of leukaemia.
Kanye West hides pro-Trump-thirade and wears MAGA-pet after its appearance in Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go like he hoped.
Kanye West was shown during a Saturday night live broadcast following an unparalleled event in which he won the US President Donald Trump and said he would become a presidential candidate in 2020.
After he had brought his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with a pet on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he cut off a triad against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
‘Sometimes when I talk to a white man, he asks, ‘How can you now have a sympathy for Trump? He is a racist!’
When I was worried about racism, I was out of America for a long time, he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon struck the dragon with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Committee for Justice in connection with the alleged attack of Christine Blasey Ford.
West's triad wasn't sent out, but comical Chris Rock uploaded it to social media.
It's not clear if Rock with his post wants to hit the dragon with West.
West also complained to the public that he had been taken backstages under fire for his pet.
‘They got me backstage.
They said, ‘Don’t step on the stage with that pet.’
They got me.
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see what apathetic looks like?’ He said he would attract her superman-cape, ‘for that means you can’t order me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me a love.'
From the audience, at least twice a book call came and the castes of SNL appeared to be embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was told by a visitor: ‘The whole studio was suddenly quiet.’
West was too guest as last-minute replacement of singers Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with an implementation of the number I Love it while he was dressed as Perrier-Flage.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: ‘To one of our bravest spirits: Thanks YOU THE MASSA TROTSEERT.’
But talk show-presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just ‘normal himself, and that's wonderful.'
‘But I choose to reward someone who is an ideology that damages, supports, and ejects my community (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
We added 'em, too.
Before the show began, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, ‘the being that is formally known as Kanye West’.
He's not the first artist to change his name. He was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collegiate rapper Snoop Dogg also wore the name Snoop Lion and the last musical Prince once changed his name into a symbol and then in The Artist formally known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was thrown into a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to appear on Monday before the police judge in Belfast.
The prosecution will be investigated by the Public Ministry.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington leads to toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as sword fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor picks up the stereotype of the macho hero and says that young boys often think they have to be smart to get respect when looking at such roles on the screen.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought that ‘there was something wrong’ and wondered how the problem of toxic manhood should be addressed in the time of #MeToo.
Kit, recently married to his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem needs to be addressed.
'This is a very important question for me at the moment: where has it gone wrong with our humanity?' he said.
"What did we learn when men grew up, so that we are now faced with this problem?"
Kit thinks that television could be partly responsible for the increase of toxic manhood by its very male characters.
He went on, "What was born and what was taught?"
What is taught on TV and on the street that young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of the big questions today: how do we change that?
'Cause there's obviously something wrong with young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not act in prequels or sequentials of Games of Thrones when the series ended next summer, because he is “clear with battlefields and horses”.
From November, Kit plays with him in a Revival of True West of Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is the assailant.
The actor recently revealed that he finds his meeting with his wife Rose the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the show, so that's how I've kept my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy that was crowned with an Emmy.
The couple were married in June 2018 on the property of Leslies family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
Only 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was not the case in the past.
In the past, HIV has rapidly spread in some parts of China through transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people who are living in this way is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been no longer punishable in China since 1997 but discrimination against LGBT people has been widespread.
According to studies estimated 70 to 90% of men who had sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Diseases are often transferred by inadequate protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication in the context of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff member has leaked data from Republican senators and leads out to 'dangerous lies' and 'complot theories'
The U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters argues that one of its staff members has placed the personal data of three American Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims that the charges are spread by ‘extreme rights’ complaints and websites.
‘Lithuanian lies, lies, and more common lies’, Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and telephone number of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate committee on the charges of sexual misconduct to Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address that indicates the source of the posts is linked to the Waters office and contained the information of a Waters employee, the Hill said.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," said Waters.
‘My partner, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false charges, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unwarranted accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie.'
Waters' statement has already been criticised online, including by former press officer of the White House Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial sounds angry’, Fleischer wrote.
‘From here you can open that she does not have the temper to be a Congressman.
If a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He doesn't have to be rebellious.
He must not question the defendant's motives.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fleischer appeared to compare the response of Waters to the criticism of the Democrats on Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive evil during Thursday's hearing.
Also Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take over Waters' place in the interim elections, gave his opinion on Twitter.
'Fifty, if it's true,' he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement authorities of these false charges.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are known," she said, "and that they are legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff members."
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British impact, we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and that is indeed to apply to this revival of the Johnny English-French, the comic action films with a slow spy in the head, which began with Johnny English in 2003 and was called back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy self-satisfied about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with eye-swimming and flexible faces manages to send everything in a hundred, including his second comeback. From his name you can already derive that he is a general comic character that was considered for bioscopists in countries where one speaks a language other than English.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamorous, a little Clouseau, a member of Mr. Bean and a member of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots or Fire during the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
It is originally based on the traveller and the international mysterious man who Atkinson ever played in Barclaycard's TV spots (who are all forgotten in the meantime) who always leaves a certain mess.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I found it wonderful how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval arms suit and the rotor blades against his helmets.
Atkinson can show how much talent he has for physical comedy in this film, but the humour is rather weak and crazy enough, especially now the "serious" film series such as 007 and Mission Impossible itself include comedy as an ingredient, and do that well.
The humour seems to be intended for children rather than for adults, and the doll disaster of Johnny English is less original and focused on me than the jokes without the text of the character Bean playing Atkinson.
The constant theme is now that Britain is experiencing great difficulties.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, making it known the identity of all active secret agents of Britain, to the great disengagement of the agent in function, a sad little role of Kevin Eldon.
That is the drop that makes the hammer pass by the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and terribly unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson does her very best with this character that makes Teresa May think, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her information advisors, she has to put in place a retired spy, as each active spy has been compromised.
And that means Stunning Johnny English himself, who now works as a school teacher in a chic institution, but unofficially teaches about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the spies of English who are thinking of School or Rock.
English is quickly released on Whitehall for an emergency letter and reunited with his former miserable help Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is the captain of a submarine, an awkward and jubilant role that lies under Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service are thus back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloodthirsty woman fatal Ophelia Bulletin.
In the meantime, the prime minister is unfortunately concerned with the charms of the charismatic technology millennium that claims he can solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start off on their odyssey of funny doll fun: dressed as officers they burn a discreet French restaurant, they kick ladyship on board the luxury of Volta and English reject pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to make himself familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
To that end, all the registers are opened, but how well-intended and unscrupulous the scene is also, she does what she thinks of child television.
It's not all very original.
And just like the other movies of Johnny English, I ask myself: can the British film sector really not think of any role that affects Rowan Atkinson's talent?
Labour rejects the fact that the party is a plan for Britain to work four days a week, but is paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would consider a radical plan for Britain to work four days a week, but pay for five days.
According to the party, based on companies, the savings they make as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence (A.I.) would be passed on to their employees by giving them an extra day of vacation.
In this way, workers can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn a lot.
According to sources, the idea in the economic agenda of the party and the plans to make the country's balance in the direction of the workers is ‘past’.
The transition to a work week of four days has already been approved by the Trade Unions Agreement, which considers it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-ranking source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: ‘A policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not take place from one moment to the other, but a four-day work week is an objective that is appropriate within the party's effort to make the economy more efficient for workers and also within the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party has already promised a four-day work week in the 2017 rural election campaign.
However, the aim is not yet supported by the full Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A four-day work week is not the party's policy purpose, nor is it considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of the 'visible drivers' and the 'owners' in utility companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover the full value of their share, as a Labour government could apply 'debts' on the basis of observed misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the management boards of companies and to set up inclusive ownership funds (Inclusive Ownership Funds) to give 10 per cent of the company’s shares from the private sector to employees who can earn up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 minutes' or the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh may change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court with at least one week's delay and raises the question whether the FBI's findings could allow Republican senators to withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview sent Sunday at '60 Minutes', Scott Pelley, former correspondent to the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI, could discover something that could lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I told the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charge came out, and I asked him, "Have you done it?"
He was resolute, determined, irrefutable."
However, Graham's voice seems to be strong.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamism," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one who was named by her could verify.
It's 36 years ago.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to the reduction of poverty?
This Saturday in New York is organized at the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up will take place on stars and a equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people for the Global Citizen Festival will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting here.
Concert participants who want to try a free card for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, a world leader e-mailing, telephoneing or generating awareness in another significant way for the purpose: ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with another 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea to reward people with a free concert an appropriate way to convince people to demand action or is this just another form of 'clitivating', people feel they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have registered more than 19 million 'actions' of supporters, which have focused on a wide range of different objectives.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to the commitment of world leaders and policy proposals worth more than $37 billion to change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the Group quoted 390 initiatives and declarations on the basis of the actions, of which at least $10 billion has been paid out or brought together by sponsorship.
The group estimates that the funds received so far have had an impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
This group has promised Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after they received more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national governments and of Global Citizens as you can from the social injustice that is undernourished, make a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, the public at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent in which the British government was asked to improve the feeding situation for mothers and children, the government announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, to support 5 million women and children with food interventions.
In response to one of the many questions on the Global Citizens website that asked "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The group said, "It will be a long and difficult path. We will sometimes fall into it and fall into error.
But, like civil rights and anti-discrimination movements before us, we will eventually be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the artists that will take place this year during the New York event presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States is able to deploy the Navy for a 'block' in order to prevent Russian exports of energy - Minister for Home Affairs
Washington may 'if necessary' take refuge in the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, according to Ryan Zinke, the US Minister of Home Affairs, as stated by the Washington Examiner.
Sinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is an obstacle to exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that they are only in the Middle East to act in energy, as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said, according to the report.
And according to the officials, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has this possibility, with the Navy, to ensure that the routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zinkke spoke for those invited at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without a profit target that shows itself as the 'voice of the energy consumer' in the US.
He went on and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that they did not differ substantially.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is to use and replace fuels" he said and referred to Russia as a country that knows only a 'art', with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump government is trying to stimulate and replace the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, a country that offers the cheapest option for European consumers.
For these reasons, officials of the Trump government, including President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw its view from the 'unsuitable' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which according to Trum van Berlin made the 'captive' of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is only driven by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we agree with the idea that energy must not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," said Aleksandr Novak, the Russian Minister of Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Minister of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position triggered a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Federal Association of Deutsche Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third possibility is facing our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'is thinking seriously about it after' to participate in the presidential elections in 2020, says Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, said Saturday that she 'thinks deeply about it' to take part in the presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
At a local meeting in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about participating in the elections.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to restore the corrupt government, and this also holds that a woman in the top position," she said according to The Hill's political newspaper.
"After 6 November, I will think seriously about it to make me the president."
Warren ran out against President Donald Trump at the meeting in the Town Hall and said that he "sent this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm so upset about what Donald Trump brings into our democracy," she said.
Warren was openly critical of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we have to wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on this."
However, an opinion study published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own attachments do not have to make themselves available in 2020.
Eighty percent of the 'probably' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator was not to be elected, according to an opinion study by the Political Research Center of the Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Twenty-two percent was there for her to be elected.
The investigation showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 per cent prior to a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with possible participation in the 2020 presidential elections are former Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
He said that he would officially take a decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about the PTSS of Track Palin during a election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after serving in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence on Monday night.
"Because of what my own son has to do, what he is doing now, I understand for other families who experience the effects of PTSS and the injuries with which some of our soldiers return," she told the audience that was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they're coming back a little differently, they're coming back and they're getting harder, they're coming back and wondering if there's any respect for what their soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given to the country of their father".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, involvement in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new U.S. policy, refusing asylum to victims who are on the run for gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. last Friday, as 'friend-of-the-court', submitted a statement to the Washington court in support of an asylum-seeker who advocated this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace versus Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union attached in August against federal policy, has not been announced.
She says that her partner "and her violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her, but that US officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the states supporting Grace, described by El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people are from asylum seekers in the United States, as countries experiencing major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has withdrawn a decision from the Board of Immigrant Appeals from 2014, which made it possible for immigrants without documents that are on the run for domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the Attorney General of Washington D.C., said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "neglects ten years of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and that such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" is set out in the declaration of 'friend-of-the-court'.
The lawyers further argue that the policy of denying immigrants access to the US is detrimental to the US economy, as these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'provides the necessary labour'.
In June, Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asiel is available to those who flee their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion" thus Sessions in its announcement on 11 June of the policy.
Asiel was never meant to alleviate all problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people get to make each day, everywhere in the world.
Hopeful rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
The situation also worsened for survivors.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while she tried to comfort her short baby in an evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
A clean water is scarce."
Residents returned to their ruined homes and searched their overnight possessions for valuable items they could still use.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals are overcrowded, unless they are damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the scale of Richter.
Some injuries, including Dwi Haris, which have broken back and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the chance of severe shocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was printed against the rest of a wall," Harris told an Associated Press correspondent, adding that he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and then I didn't hear anything.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of 'intimacy' with 'propaganda ads'
One week after an official Chinese newspaper posted an advertisement of four pages’s in an American newspaper, which highlighted the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of the use of the American press to spread propaganda.
American President Donald Trump last referred to China's paid annex Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of interference in the US Congress Elections of 6 November, an accusation that is denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to cope with the U.S. elections marked, according to U.S. officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in a escalating campaign by Washington to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed higher import tariffs.
China's payrolls early in the trade war were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had hit US workers, farmers and businesses.
"China," as Branstad wrote in an opinion poll in Des Moines Register of Sunday, "now doubles the intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese government makes use of freedom of expression and of a free press, a long-earned tradition in America by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at a kiosk in the center of Beijing you will find different voices in vain and you will not see a true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people have made possible on the difficult economic path, because the media is firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent news pages refused to publish his article", when he did not say which news sheet this was.
By the Kavanaugh debacle, the Republicans have just removed female voters from their ranks for the interim elections, warned analysts
Now many important Republicans are cutting themselves around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defending him against various allegations of sexual violence, warning analysts that this will lead to a relapse, particularly among women, during the forthcoming interim elections.
The emotions surrounding this subject have been enormous, and most Republicans have already indicated that they want to go through with the vote.
"These things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that appeared on Saturday.
Reeher said he was wondering if the attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (Republicain, Arizona) to appeal at the last moment for an FBI investigation would be sufficient to satisfy the evil voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, and they will not forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and country spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning demonstrators shouted "November comes to pass!" during their demonstration at the Senate Hall, while the Republicans under the control of the Committee of Justice had things to do to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach record heights," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can go further, especially among women's sleepy voters in the suburbs and among young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who often do not vote even though they do not agree with the president."
Even for Ford's public testimony, in which she further explained her charge of sexual harassment against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that there could be a return if the Republicans were to suppress the appointment.
"This has become a confusing mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican Party, last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote in committee, or about the final vote or the Kavanaugh taking place in court, but also about the way in which the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have dealt with it," says Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats to be elected, clearly to the new channel.
The Americans, however, seem to be divided on the question of who they believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority signing up for the latter.
A new opinion study by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents believe in the testimony of Ford and 35 per cent believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh had certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's proposal, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Ford said last week to the Senate's Justice Committee under oath that Kavanaugh had influenced her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her her genitals during a festival during the time they both studied with Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to engage with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology industry, is a company based on the open source platform Solid van Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the possibility to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world domination' is the leading idea behind Inrupt.
"We should do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own 'Personal Online Data Storage' or POD.
These include lists of contact persons, lists of activities, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is that it completely depends on the user who has access to which information.
The company calls this 'personal power through data'.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to CEO John Bruce that the company provides the resources, processes and required skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers who have been contracted to work on the project, and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not going to have a conversation with "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that puts all their business models in their heads at once".
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Media published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission (of Inrupt) is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that protects the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential vote in the debate on net neutrality.
Also after the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Spiritual and Carrier of the Victoria Cross from WO I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a military is honored in his place of birth 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel, the honorary Bernard Vann obtained the distinction due to the attack at Bellengise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had been honored by the highest British military.
A memorial stone was discovered by its two small zones during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the small zones, Michael Vann, said that it was 'gliant symbolic' that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather was distinguished.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on September 29, 1918 on the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense mist and under heavy fire of field fire and machine guns".
He then stormed through the fire line and led the line forward before he went only to a field-shadow run and three members of the detachment turned off.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German shield guard on October 4, 1918, something more than one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something, which I know I can never touch, but also something that makes me feel humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also put a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honored to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the strength of a real hero is evident from the support he receives from a large number of people".
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and get Peppa Pig in place
Imagine, you've been awake all night to watch a trained Bellator 206 and you won't get the most important moment.
There were 13 matches on the San Jose ticket, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just at the time that Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald prepared themselves for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were unfavorably surprised when the transmitter switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were upset because they had been awake all night especially for this fight.
One fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"In accordance with the rules of the government, after 6:00 a.m., no content that is not suitable for children should be displayed in the morning, and that is why we had to switch to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication with Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
"Puppa it pig," yess.
Scott Coker, business president of Bellator, said that they are going to adjust their programming to ensure that viewers in the United Kingdom also get a chance in the future.
"I think, with a view to the fight back, that we can solve this problem," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, many text messages went over and over and believed me, they weren't all equally friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I can promise this won't happen the second time.
We limit the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual nature
The Olympic janitor Tom Daley says that during his youth he felt inferior because of his sexual character, but that this gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 40-year-old said he didn't realize that 'not everyone is like me' until he went on to continue his education.
In a conversation with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about human rights to give others 'hope'.
He also said that the age had contributed to his less value to winning during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-term show, has been released for a few months because of the disease.
Apparently as a shift to Laverne's first program, Daley told him that during his youth he felt less than others because it was 'socially not accepted to find both girls and boys'.
He said: "To this day are those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was 'someone', so he wouldn't disappoint people if they finally came after his character.
The winner of two sources of Olympic medals has become a prominent campaign leader for the LGBT community and has used his presence at the Community Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he was in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, who met in 2013, "has completely surprised me".
Daley was married to the Oscarner last year, who was 20 years older than he was, but he said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you are so young, he took part in his first 14-year-old Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later, it's hard to find someone in your own age group who has the same height and low points.
In June, the couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "whole perspective" was changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after receiving the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked if they had already received the cards for London in 2012, because he wanted to be on the first row.
"I couldn't get it over my heart to say you won't be there to sit on the first row anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stopped and died, I finally recognized that he was not infallible," he said.
The following year, Daley joined the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"I knew that I had dreamed of this all my life. To dive for a home audience during the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first musical selection, Proud by Heather Small, who had strongly attacked him on the way to the games and where he still got chicken.
Desert Island Disks is listening to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on the bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he has to find his form back to avoid making a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who participates for the 12th time in the two-year event, was placed on the bank by the team Captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and practicing the driving range, in an attempt to find out where it is restricted.
Since he was never even on the top of his career known for his right drive, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the close fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs dangling balls is routinely punished.
And if the job on itself is not scary enough, Mickelson in the ninth match on Sunday will always come the accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against which is linked to the newlywed Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are behind four points at the beginning of the 12 single games start well, the Mickelson match can be absolutely crucial.
Fury made it clear that he had confidence in this man, even though he could honestly say otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a kick on my back, beat his arm around me and said he's ready for it tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He was included in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I would have expected more, but it is what it is and it is the way we have to act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record for the highest number of played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never completely matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has 18 winning matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games standing on his name, but Fury said his presence had a certain despicable influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to get jokes with people and he's a great guy to be on the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players found it fun to keep him out of trouble last week, which was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than his own game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great progress can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable advance ahead of the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Deen made his debut in the game at Valderrama in 1997, where the team with Captain Seven Ballesteros had a lead of five points on the Americans, but finally the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, here, after seeing the lighting of 2018 win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 advantage on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and all the others in the team that this is not yet a game.
Everyone will have to make a full effort tomorrow.
Go ahead and run the plan on the right one.
It's not over until the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's this trophy win, and that's where we need to keep our focus.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Rejoiced over the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead in this area.
A new challenge is waiting for tomorrow.
In the morning, the individual performances will come to an end, and that is a very different discipline.
It's great to be out there with a partner if it's good, but when you stand alone, your abilities as a golfer are just being tested.
That's the message you need to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he has to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who overcame three of the four points.
Fury himself has experience with both sides of this kind on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brooklyn and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Mirakel of Medina'.
"I remember every damn word of that talk," he said in answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had got his players up for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brooklyn, or like in Medina.
When we have the moment, there's a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We have agreed our line-up to this and send the men on their way in the order we think is the best and, you know, we're going to try something out of the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to guide the opposition and puts Rory McIlroy in front of the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
The new warship of Germany is suspended again.
The German Navy's latest fleet should have been in service in 2014, replacing the old warships from the Cold War, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to defective systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The establishment of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, quoted by a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the Navy in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 were to replace the older frgates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a series of air- and anti-shipcraft rockets and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic features.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to put in place the latest frigates up to two years later, away from home ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that the advanced warships, designed to enable Germany to project its power overseas, have been obsolete by the time they are engaged, notes that time.
The fatal frigate F125 had already received the newspapers last year, when the German Navy officially refused to launch the vessel and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but German media quoted a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it was put into a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 seamen, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It was also clear that the ship was heavily overweighted, thus reducing the performance and limiting the possibilities of the marine to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as many as ships of a similar class that were employed by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price card for the complete project, including crew training, becomes a problem.
It is said that this has reached a thousand-dollar €3.1 billion, compared with the original €2.2 billion.
The problems that the newest frogs have in their grip are particularly important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German Navy will decline.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Parliamentary Defence Commission in Germany, acknowledged that the Marine actually "has a shortage of usable ships".
The official said that the problem of the time as a snowball had grown, because old ships had been taken from the company but no replacement vessels had been delivered.
He complained that none of the Frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were yet available to be included in the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of pets
New research carried out on a farm in the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how to use pets in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed fresh light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland follows the usual and small drug-flight mouse, the brown large-flight mouse and the waterflight mouse at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment shall be placed at key locations around the land to monitor the activities of the poultry by the season.
NTS and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the mouse's guts and what kind of action they are doing.
Then a map of the habitat and a report is produced to make such a detailed picture on the landscape scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Advisor, hopes that the results show what habitat areas are most important for poultry mice and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the making of pastures and how we can best maintain the forests for bats and similar species.
Flying mouse populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have been significantly reduced in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and beams can also pose a risk, as can flyers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
Their night hunting habits, however, make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight size.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts who regularly investigate, carry out sleep inspection and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up the first and only reservation for pets in Scotland at the Thrave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of pets live in Scotland.
Land manager David Thompson says that the land is the ideal territory for sheep mice.
"Here in Thrave we have a great environment for pet mice," he said.
"We have the old buildings, very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is so much information about leather mice yet and therefore the work that we do here and in other locations will help us to better understand what they need to do."
It stresses the importance of monitoring poultry before maintenance work is carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping area may lead to the death of 400 female poultry and their young, which may result in the removal of a whole local population.
Flying mice are a protected animal species and it is illegal to kill them, to fall or destroy them.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish Officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, "We still need to learn a lot about our fur mice and many of our species we just don't know how to deal with their populations."
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo accused of assault qualified as 'fake news' and said that people 'want to promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to appeal to the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the charges were published.
The peaks of Portugal and Juventus are accused of assaulting an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of having paid her $375.000 to be silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live named Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the charges were reported, reports 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Ballen on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be named by calling my name, but that's part of the class.
I'm a happy man, and through and through," the footballer added to this, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers prepare a case in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the charges they called 'an irreplaceable reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the footballer wants compensation for the 'moral damage to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they had met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer's room, where, according to the accusation, he had raped her analytics, as is to be read in the prosecution filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a 'good guy' for '99 percent', but that he was sometimes left in the trap that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was mutually acceptable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that there were photos of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed with an extrajudicial arrangement because she was 'fearing the consequences' and because she was concerned about 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says she wants to invalidate the scheme because she is permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go to Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and this summer went to the Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'will have forever regret' leave as auto producers
The United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' if it loses its status as world leader in the field of auto production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that Toyota UK had said to the BBC that, as Britain, the EU would leave without a deal, the company would temporarily put production in the factory in Burnston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese autoproducer said that the impact of delays at the border in the case of 'no-deal Brexit' jobs would be costly.
The factory in Burnston, where the Auris and Avensis of Toyota are made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that as Britain crashed out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory stillfalls," said Marvin Cooke, the managing director of Toyota in Burnston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also revealed their fears about the consequences of a departure from the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most car manufacturers are concerned about the risks in the delivery chains in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
The production line of Toyota is based on the 'just-in-time' principle, whereby every 37-minute parts arrive from suppliers in the UK and in the EU for cars on order.
If, on 29 March, the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there can be an alarming gap between the boundaries that can lead to delays and cuts in parts according to industry.
Toyota cannot save more than one day in stock at the factory in Derbyshire, so the company was informed, and therefore the production would be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU 'exactly agreed to avoid those border checks'.
"We should have a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also take this opportunity," he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4 today's program.
"The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we must be able to go through with this very successful set of delivery chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but in the longer term, it warned that the additional costs would affect the company's competitive position and that this would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is a representative of the United trade union at the factory, said that his members are becoming increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these jobs have been lost, they will never come back again.
One government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Meeting with Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed for another week, while the fight on the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the activities of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, links between Trump and Russia's assistants and possible interference with the presidential process.
The question whether Trump is going to dismiss the Deputy Attorney General and thus endangers Mueller's independence, the Washington wheel machine has been running for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of having a microphone to establish talks with Trump and to dismiss the President through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, they shouted that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he wanted to fire Rosenstein 'no more', but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing by the Senate Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which slowed the vote in the entire Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, the chief of Trump, appeared on Fox News.
Asked for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date for this week, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for a week, given all the other things that are under way with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters have been struggling with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the scariest of press conferences was not caused by a rejection of the 'annoxious' TV journalists, however, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention."
Then she suggested that direct contact will increase between Trump and the press.
"The President does more questions and answers than any president for him," she said, without giving evidence of this: "We have seen the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that is infinitely better than to talk to me.
We're trying to do a lot and you've seen us do that often in the last few weeks, and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with dignitaries visiting.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated perhaps why, he made an open and sometimes bizarre appearance for the collected reporters.
Minister of Health writes a letter about Brexit to NHS Scotland workers from other EU countries
The Minister of Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and the wish that they continue working with the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has been determined to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also drawn up preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know this must be an uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Members from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the NHS activities and offer benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is safe and secure, and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after headache
The linebreaker of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, suffered a rapid operation yesterday after he had suffered a major injury in the 31-27 lost match against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident was short for rest.
"He came to the sideline and sat down there a little bit or more," said Reed.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie direct oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further research.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that 'no details are yet known about the type/range of the injury' and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury has occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in its first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was taken on Saturday in total five times before leaving the field, so he was taken 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK and the proceeds are used to help the homeless according to new plans of the Conservatives
This action will have to neutralize the success of Corbyn to attract young voters
The increase in the fees shall be levied on persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects that this will amount to £ 120 million per year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK and the extra income is used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn, who attracts young voters with promises to ensure more affordable houses and to tell them about multiples.
The increase in the fees is being applied to persons and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional revenue being incurred in an effort by the government to combat neutrality.
The premium, which comes above the current leases, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for rent, may amount to up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise to £ 120 million per year in this way.
According to estimates, 13% of the new construction in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK, thus raising prices and it is difficult for starters to get a foot on the landlord.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically 'spook cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson had pleaded for a reduction in the law to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping their prices high by buying land and not using it, and he called on May to cancel quotas on affordable houses to restore the 'husting damage' in Great Britain.
Corbyn has announced a remarkable series of housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to the exhibition 'without neglect'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said, "Last year, I said that I wanted to spend my time as prime minister on restoring the British Dream, that life becomes better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be as simple as it is for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy houses here if it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people the dream of ever having a house has become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without a roof above the head has already come true."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is managing Scotland'
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says it's his 'ultimate ambition' to ever become Scotland's manager.
The Scot, 42, enjoys the challenge of bringing the club back from the northeast of England, which is currently in the third place in League One, on three points of the first place.
He went to the Stage of Light last summer after returning to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"As a footballer, I wanted to play for my father's country.
But I was selected for the B team and thus the course was off," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child, I saw my father Scotland often playing in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps attracting me.
However, that possibility would only come if I was successful in managing a club."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland's managers include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated to be the successor of these established names at a large club, before he had refused progress from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me is currently being measured by 'can I let this club go back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it must be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful when I bring the club back there."
Ross is only three years old in his career as manager, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from the edge of degradation to winning the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably really a cross-point," he recalled when he took the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I did it right, I deserved quite well, and I knew a few reasonable points.
But football can be tough.
There's a lot of things you're facing each week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the department, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now I'm real, I'm as good in my skin as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, revealed research
The heat wave in the summer has increased revenue from British pubs that have a hard time surviving, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw turnover rising by 2.7 per cent in July, but income in restaurants was 4.8 per cent less, showing the figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA's Business Advisory Office, who collected the figures, said: "Sustainable sunlight and the fact that England has been participating in the world championships longer than expected, meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had turnoverd 2.8 per cent more, with the difference that the restaurants were becoming even harder.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the turnover of restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars aimed at selling drinks paid off the best, with a better LFL growth (like-for-like) than those restaurants went down.
Pubs who are also directed to the sale of food also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It looks like people just went out for a drink.
In pubs and bars under management, the drinking rate was 6.6 per cent higher for the month, while the food market was 3 per cent lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the leisure and hospitality sector, said: "These results are continuing the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for the trade in the end-market.
It is therefore no surprise that restaurant groups continue to fight, although a turnover of 4.8 per cent year-on-year is particularly painful in view of the continuing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer for the food-oriented operators could not have come at a bad time and will only learn time if the more moderate temperatures of August can give the necessary protection."
The total turnover growth in the public and restaurant sector, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decrease in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peak Tracker, the sales monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, performance data are collected and analysed from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One of the five children has a secret account for social media, which they keep hidden for their parents
One of the five children, only under 11 years of age, has a secret account for social media, which they keep hidden for parents and teachers, reveals an investigation
Survey among 20,000 secondary school students revealed growth in 'false Insta-pages'
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say to have a 'main account' that they also show their parents
One of the five children, some not over 11 years of age, makes social media accounts that they keep hidden for adults.
An investigation among 20,000 secondary school students revealed rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the photo sharing site.
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean 'main account' that they show their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally came to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who asked others to 'whack her'.
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference) of independent schools revealed that 40% of the 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half of them had personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being beaten to create online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Elid Doyle becomes the 'vote of the athlete' in the Scottish Council for Athletics
Elid Doyle was elected as a non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the job and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for sports drivers to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilid has a lot of respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from her election in the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can make a contribution and help control the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and 400 meters during the 1996 games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "This month I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that it would only take time to learn if I would recover and to what extent.
It has been awfully hard work, but I am now completely restored, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all your support!"
An ad for breast pump in which mothers are compared with cows, distributes online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has distributed the online opinion with an ad that compares seeking mothers to cows that are milled.
In order to mark the introduction of what is called 'the most silent portable breast pump in the world', Elvie, a consumer technology producer, has issued an ironic, inspired advertisement on music videos to illustrate the freedom that this new pump has to offer to collapsing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a bowl full of high-song that contains texts like: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything' and 'In case you didn't watch it, these are not eyes, these are my breasts'.
The refresher then follows with: 'Pomps, pumps, pumps, I feed the baby's, pumps, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's.
However, the ad, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has directly ensured an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has released hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that it compensates the 'horror' of the dairy industry.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they should be expected and ordered to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days after the order" is written in a response.
The breast pump of Elvie fits discreetly in a feeding beha (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else noted, "Of course, it's traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song 'hilaric'.
"I find this a great idea.
I'd buy it if I was still breast-feeding.
That pump gave me the feeling of being a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been looking too much for it.
This is a brilliant product" wrote someone.
Someone else had the following remark: "This is a funny ad, focused on moms that snakes (often at the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like they just have to be 'coys'.
This ad does not appear at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their behaes.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who are snakes sometimes feel just cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no strings or snakes and fits discreetly in a diet, so that women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they're in cages.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says about this: "The Elvie Pump is a dermaté revolutionary product that earned a bold and provocative introduction.
By comparing collapsing mothers and milk cows, we wanted to put the collagen and the associated challenges in the snowflakes and at the same time show in a supportive and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski's catwalk while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has reached a peak, although the number of monthly cross-border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and the harsh policy introduced by the Trump government makes it more difficult to bring children into sponsorship.
Traditionally, most sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and are afraid of their own chance to remain in the country by registering for a child.
This risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households should print their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to the fact that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as sponsor for unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 per cent of the prisoners had no previous criminal record.
"Almost 80% of those who are sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
We're pursuing these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to speed up the treatment of children, officials introduced new rules, forcing some of them to appear before the court within 60 days, which was the standard, according to the employees at the station, within one month of the beginning of the detention.
Many of them will be through a videoconferencing for the court, instead of in person, to plead their application for a legal status for an immigration right.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for aid will be quickly deported.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to flee, according to the workers at the station and according to reports that have come out of the system in the last few months.
Lawyers said that these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child struggles are more often ignored, because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally for it or to say good-bye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them still struggle with.
Syria recommends that the US, France and Turkey withdraw immediately.
In a speech for the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem has also called for the Syrian refugees to return, even now the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also a vice-premier, said that foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, in the interests of combating terrorism and that 'it will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the House.
According to Moualem, the "was on terror almost past" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been kidnapped and driven from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this holy war until we freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from a "possible illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly involved in training and advising the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the country affected by war.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were favourable for their return and he intended to 'distribute some Western countries irrational fears' so that most refugees would remain away.
"We have made a call to the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are policing a matter that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available for Syria until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major roundabout of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has led to a massive attack by the Russian-based Syrian troops in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that this agreement knew 'clear deadlines' and said that he hoped that the military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front connected to Al-Qaeda, who would be 'cut off'.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN representative, hopes soon to convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government members and the opposition to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and open the way for elections.
Moualem made it clear what the conditions of the Syrian Government were to participate in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited 'to revising the articles of the current Constitution' and he warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the election in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers are likely to hope, his presidency is temporarily terminated by a set-up procedure and scandals.
In what, of course, would be 'the most dramatic end of a presidency ever'.
At this point, however, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s primary-time viewers have doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show of MSNBC is at the top of the evaluations for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers at night with important news.
"It's a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who was responsible for the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitool.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Five Hard Truths About Snaging Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why?
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh'," Scovel told me.
There's entertainment value in chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the stories coming from Washington can affect the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being a well-informed citizen, when you see that you have been looking at a panel of experts for six hours discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', which it has about the Jack of Paul Manafort's pauper who has cost $15,000 ('a piece full of overt' according to The Washington Post) and discussing the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
Anyway, I'll never be able to look at Super Mario the same way again.
"What he's doing to give you the idea that it's a reality show is partly that he allows you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role-sharing of the Trump show and the day-to-day plots (a fight with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss a delivery or you have the idea that you're running behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kaui, but he was looking into MSNBC while he recorded CNN.
He could not escape the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh who had to appear before the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the Court of Justice at stake.
"I remember that we did all those strange shows, not so long ago, and that people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows in the most exciting interim elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees an influx of money, thanks to a redeployment of a electoral district, which requires two people's representatives to fight for the same seat.
The recently re-distributed district of Pittsburgh meets the Democratic People's Representative Connor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district in a special spring.
Lamb must record it against another representative of the people, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is familiar with the new 17th district.
The cards were reclassified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held in January that the old districts were not legally classified ('gerrymanding') in favour of the Republics.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a gap in campaign funding between the financial poor of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a grand victory in a well-known special election for the 18th electoral district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied for more than ten years by a Republican and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China and rejected it
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owns a hotel in Panama until his partners put out the Trump Organization management team.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States have decided to withdraw the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision not to recognise Taiwan' said Heather Nauert, the Prime Minister of the Ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
However, only penalties were considered in the case of El Salvador, as the country received $140 million in American aid in 2017, for control of drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high homicide rates.
While the internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference, which would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from leaving the United States.
But in mid-September, some senior officials from the government were aware that they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible sanctions against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence is giving a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the government attaches to the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further withdrawal, without any hard news about Washington's criminal measures.
A spokesman for the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who was also close to the government and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study history
The next step can be the report of the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible counter-action of justice by Trump, for which serious evidence has now become publicly known.
Mueller's research is likely to focus on co-existence between the Trump and Russia campaign in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If the Congress changes color, Trump must be responsible for that institute, just as he is preparing to go back to the voters, and perhaps he should be responsible for a jury in a court of law.
That is a hope, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will determine how long the battle will take.
In 1938 German officials were ready to perform a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and Czecho-Slovakia had supported in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such bending points and the irrevocable momentum of democracy is thereby accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently confronted with various of these kinds of bending points.
What will we do if Trump Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation, is released?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since he reported that, over the past year, he had proposed to speak to the President in secret and that he had speculated about the President's suitability for his office.
Rosenstein says the report of The Times is wrong.
"How will we react if the new investigation requested by the FBI to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not fair, or if he is appointed in the Supreme Court despite credible charges of assault and an unfair witness?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that will call for Trump to be responsible?
If we fail in these tests, democracy is waiting for a very long winter.
But I don't think we're going to miss the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever owned my ambassador's home.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me, 60 years later, away to add candles for the Sabbath on that table on which a washing was depicted.
With that as my heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the race against Rapid Vienna
Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday visit and know that a victory on the Austrians, after the impressive match in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, places them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the European League.
Because of a kneeblossom, the midfielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first game from the season until the 2-2 match at Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use the outcome as a jumpboard to better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villareal really has a good eleventh," said the 31st.
"We went into the game with the idea that there was something to win and came out with a point.
Maybe we could have even won at the end, but over the entire game, a fair game is probably an honest result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half, we were the best team.
The next Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully, we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough match because they also had a good result in their last match, but if the public is behind us, I'm sure we can press through and we can get a positive result.
Last year has certainly been hard, of all that has happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a fault factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully, we can now press through, let the past season follow us and make it a success again."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of their pension
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few people discuss this with their family members.
About half of the participants in Nationalwide's research said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10% said that they had talked to their children about it.
"People like to see a family member take care of them, but they don't need to take the steps to make this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your spouse(s) and the children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not make your wishes known in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, because these choices can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take a financial advisor in the arm: Your advisor can also give you advice on how you can pay these expenses.
Your long-term financing options may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or invest your own assets as insurance, as long as you have money.
Create legal documents: Avoid legal battle when insurance is to be used.
Take care of a health care authority, so that you can indicate a trusted person who can review your medical care and ensure that professionals stick to your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider, too, a mandate for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make your financial decisions on behalf of you and to make sure that the invoices are paid if you cannot do this yourself.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Put these details in a written plan, so you have the information at hand.
"It is not only the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medications are being used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes."
Fired several times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air - pressure gun when he walked home after an evening.
The victim, forty plus, was in the Oxford Grove near Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents describe the designation, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'willing act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the expectation is that the mortality will continue to rise.
As the communication media have been disabled, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Dongalla Regent, a region north of Palu which is closer to the epicenter of the movement with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Midden-Celebes and is at the end of a small bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was the fourth 40th anniversary of the tsunami.
Dondakala is a regency that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwestern Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region just under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the Middle-Celebes province, in particular in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Dongala have been regularly hit by tsunamis in the past hundred years, according to the Indonesian Disasters Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck west of Dongala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh in northern Sumatra on 26 December provided a tsunami that struck 14 countries and required a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Atjeh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 on the scale of Richter took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that struck the southern coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 on the scale of Richter met the city of Padang, capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 on the scale of Richter met one of the Mentawai islands, on the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed tens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: An in-depth earthquake struck Pidie in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic, as the people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people found death by falling buildings.
2018: More earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where more than 500 people were killed, for the majority on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and made sure that thousands of tourists were temporarily beached.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and the candidate for the vice-president, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and the provision of opposition during the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged arrests, he dropped her phone.
Palin is held in custody at the Mat-Su storage house with a bailout of $500, reported by KTUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday and declared himself 'innocent, certainly knowing' when he was asked this, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three violations of Class A, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also accused of a Class B violation, which is punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017 he was accused of mistreating his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case is now before Alaska's veterinary court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon of influence in connection with the incident.
His friend claimed to have shot her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised in 2016 by a group of veterans, after she had linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSS, that he would have abandoned his service time in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after an earthquake in the Indonesian island of Celebes met on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 on the scale of Richter has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks are off, while the expectation is that the mortality rate will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the centre of Celebes, which lies to the northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York require the death penalty for Sayfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people were killed, a rare penalty that has not been implemented in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, reportedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he was on his way with pedestrians and bikers, almost already in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov 'votely' killed the eight victims and 'votely' has caused serious physical injuries, according to the declaration of intent in which the death penalty is required, which has been filed in the Southern District of New York.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the charge with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a rocket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack requires 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and they describe the way in which Siepov carried out the attack as 'cruel, cruel and destructive'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellaevictsj Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" is in the statement of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is more than ten years ago that a case was brought in the Southern District of New York where the death penalty was demanded.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder on two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after they had been sentenced to espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953 by means of the electric chair.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not give evidence of breach in the days and months following the attack, according to the legal documents.
He let the investigator know he felt good about his action, she's the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after viewing videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the prosecution.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, the police told him.
He did not claim to be guilty of the charge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saypov, said that he was 'naturally disappointed' with the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a debt confession in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," Patton said.
Sajpov's defense had already asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Preservative Member says that NIGEL FARAGE should guide the Brexit negotiations
Today, Nigel Farage promised to mobilize a folk leader during a protest at the Conference of the Conservative Party.
The former leader of Ukip said that the politicians should feel the 'hot' of the Eurosceptic, while one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians proposed to guide him in the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants in Birmingham in March that the UK 'would already be out' as Mr. Farage Brexit was.
But the challenge that may be faced with the reconciliation of the heavily divided leaders is underlined by two conservations that are pro-Remain and that participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on the road while this is being attacked by Brexitiers, Remainers and the EU.
Fellow Members were confident that she would continue and try to close a deal with Brussels despite the obstacles, forcing Eurosceptici and Labour to choose between its package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to throw 'Chequers in the dirty man'.
He proposed that Farage be addressed and that it be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was out of service, we'd be out of it now," said Bone.
The Members of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw Chequers into the lunatic."
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone suggested that the public opinion has been changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
The conservative Brexitier Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: "I just say: prime minister, listen to people.
Chequers is unpopular with the big audience, the opposition is not going to vote, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure we get elected.
Let Chequers fall and listen."
In a message addressed to May, she added: "Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the 'hot' if they betray the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them, 'we're not letting you get out of here."
In a message to the most enthusiastic mass, he added: "I want you to put our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, on fire.
We mobilize the national army of this country that has taken care of our victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we are again an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and ended this March with a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists swam with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood after the group was set up in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, member of the Labour High House, made jokes about the security problems of a Conservative party at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide for IT systems and for all technology for Canada plus, for the free limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren's plan to "think good" about presidential candidacy
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll be 'well thinking about her presidential candidacy' after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told about her future at a meeting in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, a Republican member of the Trum campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was the center of speculation that she might be fighting Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
A visitor asked her if she would be eligible for the presidency.
Warren answers that it's time for women to go to Washington to restore our defective government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after killing Wayde Sims of LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the shooting of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, during an ET conference at 11:00.
They gave a video free of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man in the movie.
Sims, 20, was shot down and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and was killed with its consequences," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot down by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and was known to have been present at the crime scene, in possession of a firearm and have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and is arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1.98 meters who was raised in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches and started last season in 10 matches. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel has left him the victory after team orders
When Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that a team of orders from Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from pole position and almost let Hamilton stand in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the chest and left Hamilton in the dusty rides in the tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went in a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on his head after a wheel-on-wheel action that forced the Ferrari driver to release space on the inside after a double movement in the third curve.
Max Offappen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was a long leader of the race, because he stayed at his band selection and had a quick finish so he could pick up Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally, in the 44th round, he went to the chest, until he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen became the fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valteri did his best all weekend, and he was a real gentleman and left me behind.
The team did its best for the places one and two" said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a Saturday election meeting on the fact that she was not entirely the source of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at a election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not have the testimony given directly by Ford to the Senate's Justice Committee. Instead, he showed that what took place in the Senate showed that people could be 'common, unworthy and unworthy'."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful display that takes place in the last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and common and rude and rude," he said.
"When you look at the press and the leaks and they say 'oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it.'
You still know that?
Diane Feinstein, did you smell?
You still know her answer... you licked the document-- 'oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't smell.'
Well, wait a minute.
No, we haven't." He added this, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter stating the charges to the address of Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was leaking.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to go confidentially, and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked."
But the president failed to believe her denial, and he made a comment at the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you something, that was not a good body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst language I've ever seen."
Following his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who is accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back the power, with all the necessary means.
You see the community, the indifference, they don't give anything to who they hurt, who they have to drive to seize power and get control back" the president would have said according to a Mediaite report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have repaired the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had taken the lead with two goals by scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team along the way, before Dwyer de Giants took the lead again.
Francois Bouchard made the equaliser for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen with two goals made sure the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make a stand on Friday night to defeat Dundee by 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, where the Giants won the previous three matches.
The opening ball of Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assistant from Kendall McFaul. David Rutherford gave the assistant with whom Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt presented the proposal for the equalizer of Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants had the first rest in advance, when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team repacked and Bouchard brought them back to a level with a power-play ball at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen to lead Dundee for the first time in the match, late in the second period. He took care of the win with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies while ensuring that hundreds of aircraft can escape the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after his death because he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people could board safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Strong shocks still afflict the area and many are buried under the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild-and-flight traffic jams of the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He continued to make sure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was then ready for take-off, could rise safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic lights when he thought they were crashing.
He died in the hospital later.
Yohannes Sirat, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had a helicopter scheduled for Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter had reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths may rise to the thousands and that the country's disaster management agency is aware that access to the cities of Dongalla, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"But it assumes that the mortality continues to rise because many bodies are under the clean layers and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a massive funeral will be held Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are introduced by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted all over the world."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is designed in a race to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the military in attendance: "I appeal to all of you to work day and night so that all the tasks necessary for evacuation are completed.
Are you ready for it?" reported CNN.
earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that ran the flight that was crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that another man is missing after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the congested plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger will be missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they were working with the local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the questions for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew, after the plane had hit too much water during landing at the Chukeland airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people were brought to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What has caused the crash and what is the exact order of the events remains temporarily unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say that the plane has landed in the lagoon and the runway has missed.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has been shot over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told me that he himself and some others were able to walk through the water, which came to their midst, to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewards were panicking and shouting and that he had a no serious headache.
The U.S. Navy announced that seabirds who were near work on a ship also helped with rescue operations by bringing people to the coast with a breathable boat before the plane sinks in about 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last 20 years 111 people have died in crashes of aircraft companies registered with the PNG, but that does not apply to Air Niugini.
Analyst sets the timeline of the night a woman is burned alive
On Friday, the prosecutor concluded a requirement in the reopening process of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Ministry of Justice, gave a testimony for a few hours as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made clear to the jury how he had used the phone records to determine the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she left life.
Rowlett told that he had received the location data from various mobile phones that showed that Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went back to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was in the witness bank on Saturday and told me he wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he told him he was at Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was 'lying because my truck was in Nashville'.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told me he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The cell phone data indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis knew some time after the death of Chambers the texts, calls and contact details of his phone.
"He knew her from his life," Hale said.
The defense begins Sunday with the closing arguments.
The judge said he expected the jury to begin the day after the consultations.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hippop'?
A hipoptrio wants to put the negative image of the genre into discussion by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol points out that hippop is alienated from the origin of political opinions and addressing social problems.
They want to return to the root and make 'conscious hippop' popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently had an experience in Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York New Year's wife gives a couple to the judge because of a 'racist' text
A New York student married a married couple because of being dismissed for discriminatory reasons, after receiving a wrong-sent text in which the mother complained about 'the weather'.
The spouse refuses to be a racist and calls the case 'dispression'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her disillusionment when she discovered that the new girl, Giselle Maurice, appeared to be a Negroid woman when she met her on her first working day in 2016.
'NEEEEE WERE ZO'N ZWARTE', Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the American newspaper New York Post, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman, who felt 'uneasy' when she realized that she was blind, said that her previous stepdaughter, who was African-American, had done a bad job, and that she was expecting a Filipino.
Mrs Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home by a taxi.
Now Maurice holds the couple before the court to get compensation of $350,-- per day for the 6 months she was hired to be brewed inside the family, or without contract.
'I want them to feel you don't do anything like that,' said Maurice last Friday in the New York Post, adding: 'I know it's discrimination.'
The married couple abstained from claiming that she was racist by saying that it was reasonable to dismiss Maurice after they were afraid that they could no longer trust her.
My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists, partner Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
'But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Get out of here.'
Comparing the case to 'pressing', Plasco said that his wife expected a baby in two months and was 'in a very difficult situation'.
Would you follow someone like that?
That's not so nice, the investment banker added it.
While the case is still under way, the public opinion is quick to capitalize on social media, where it is geared to their behaviour and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would have little interest in a talking bear, revealing a newly arrived letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said about the letter: 'It's hard to get into the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even for the first publication.
With what we now know about the enormous success of Paddington, it is very pleasant.'
She told her father that, before he was inspired to write the children's book on a small toy bear, when the cameraman worked with the British broadcaster BBC, he was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book felt bitter after his death last year.
About Paddington, who describes her as 'a very prominent member of the family', she said that her father was homely proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But because Paddington was so lively for him, it almost looked like a child's performance; you're proud when you did nothing for it yourself.
I think he's had about the success of Paddington.
While Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he made the bear himself for success.'
My daughter was dying and I had to tell her on the phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was brought to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
'Nad had called several times to say that it was very bad and that it was expected that she would not get it,' said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then came Nad's phone to say that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
Then I'll be back with you.
The medications the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping, slowly worked out and left her body.
She had died some time before, and this process turned everything out further.
I could just sit there knowing what was going on.
I couldn't complain, scream, or cry because I was in the middle of all kinds of people and families.
I really needed to be big."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperous, who was now mourning the death of her daughter, took part in the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what kind of trial she had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
'I sat down with my head down and the tears remained coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I got an overwhelming sense of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Ruining women put messages on the bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are strong enough to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are picking up inspiring messages and phone numbers that can call people in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he first became depressed and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel like every day," she said.
Mrs Davis, 45 years old and residing in Lydney in the English county Gloucestershire, tells us that her son was a promising chef with an attractive grin.
'He was known for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up every room.'
Yet he already stopped working for his death because he was deep in the well."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found him after he had robbed himself of his life.
Mrs Davis said, 'I constantly worry about a chain reaction.'
Mrs. Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and where you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't be silent - talk about it.'
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say that he felt dark or depressed or something," she said.
'A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He sat all the way to the ground on Christmas Day - when the children took out their gifts he didn't look at them at all or so."
She said that his death was a great trauma to her, but that they had to process it: 'It broke the whole family apart.
It'll tell us.
But we must all go on and continue to fight.'

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain while the FBI research starts
'I thought that if we could indeed get what he asked for, a research limited in time and scope, we might be able to create a little more unity again', which was Mr Flake's last Saturday, to which he added, that he was afraid that the committee was falling 'out of each other', in the middle of a tightly anchored patchage within the party.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct a study?
Their restraint has everything to do with timing.
The interim elections have been held in five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as the Republicans are expected to do, their efforts to get their husband elected in the highest court in the country are seriously difficult.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus his wife Ashley, who the Bush was his personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has finished the report?
There will then be a vote in the Senate, which currently holds 51 republics and 49 democracies.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to deliver the final vote to confirm the appointment of Mr Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Number of passersby in North Korea 'remove' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean crossings to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-and seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Single Warding, explains that there were 1,127 overruns last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park states that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for human smugglers, are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded in public.
The vast majority of North Korean survivors are finally offered the South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreas.
China considers the survivors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often exposes them to violence.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still formally capable of war, have improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier this month the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, which discussed in particular the stagnant negotiations on denuclearization.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, with great agreement to work towards the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of the lack of progress in lifting US sanctions since then.
'Without faith in the conduct of the US, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament,' said Mr Ri during a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and finds him unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
President of the House of Deputies, Nancy Pelosi, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, and finds him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview on Saturday at the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I could not help thinking that if a woman acted like this, she would be called 'hysterical'', Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate justice committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the charges that he would have abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very excited; he sometimes screamed almost and was especially from the area when he told about his family and his high school.
He also strongly condemned the democrats in the committee, in which he called the charges against him 'great and coordinated murder', organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not fit to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudices against the Democrats.
'I think he is disqualifying himself with his statements and by the way he speaks about the Clintons and the Democrats,' said Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if she would try to set up an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he were to be appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
'That's what I can say about it; if he does not tell the truth at Congress, or against the FBI, he is not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is now serving,' said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District of Columbia Court (usually abbreviation D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a democrat that Kavanaugh would speak against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (law on affordable health).
Kavanaugh asked questions about the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation sessions.
'Don't expect us to stand merry when a hysterical, prejudiced person is appointed in the Supreme Court,' said Pelosi.
Women just have to admit to this.
It is a just triad of months and years of intense anger that passes, and they can only cry to get it out.
"We'll cry if we get angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later to me.
'I don't think that's funny, do you?'
She continued: 'I was greatly helped by a woman who was in charge of something and who told me that she was crying when she was angry. She developed a method, where she was always angry, and she cried. She said to the one she spoke to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just cried.
I just thought it was brilliant."
Tears are partly permitted as an expression of anger, because they are essentially misunderstood.
One of my best remembered memories from a previous job, in a man-dominated office, was when I had to cry awfully because I was extremely angry. An older woman, a kind of business leader who was a little scared of everyone, grabbed me in my neck and dragged me into a stairwell.
'Never let them see you cry,' she said to me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're glad they got you on the box.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart at his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was set up in an extraordinary case on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means 'kattenkwaad' or 'apentraken') and withdrew from the race, Mrs Schroeder, deeply disappointed that there was no reason why she would not apply herself.
'It wasn't a well-thought decision,' she told me 30 years later laughing.
'There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about 'Snow White and the Seven Horses'.
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind fund-raising, and so she didn't promise to join if she couldn't afford $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give $1,000 to men, wanted to give her only $250.
'Maybe they think I'm getting a discount?' she asked herself.
When she gave her speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overcome by feelings - of gratitude for the people who supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to raise money, and to reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger about sexism - that she was in trouble.
'You will have thought that I had a nerve,' recalled Mrs Schroeder about how the media responded to her.
'They'll have thought that Kleinex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my gravestone?
"She's crying?"
How to extract trade war between the US and China in favour of Beijing
The openings of the trade war between the US and China were overwhelming, and although the war has not yet been fought, a gap between the two countries could be drawn up in favour of Beijing, according to long-term experts.
Earlier this year, Donald Trump, the President of the United States, gave the first warning by raising taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation was known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (150 billion) in goods; half of all goods coming from the US from China.
Peking has taken repressives every time, most recently by raising prices from 5 to 10% for $60 billion to US goods.
China has promised to equalize the U.S. every time, and the world will probably not quickly cut its eye on a after-market economy.
To let Washington bend, requests must be granted, but publicly bending for the US is too painful for the Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing is playing the smart, the war on trade with the US, China could be positive in the longer term, by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
'The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could bring one of the two countries into a free economic fall is indeed much more dangerous than viewers have recognised earlier,' said Abigail Grace, a research associate of the 'Centre for a New American Security', a thought specialized in national security issues addressing Asia.
Syria 'prepared' to allow refugees to return, thus Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by war for over seven years.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, said Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, that the circumstances in his country would improve.
"Today, the situation is more stable and safer on the ground, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he says.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and to normalise the situation on the ground.
All circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are still about six million people in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' in southwestern Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when Danish leader Thomas Bjorn's team received the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was almost all the tournament fighting, left his long battle in the water at par 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, skimmed in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever got 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by playing the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest-ranking player on the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play from Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who possibly played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spanjaard Segrio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
'I don't cry so fast, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He gives the fable to his countrymate, John Ram, who went to defeat the American legendary Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
'The huge pride I feel because I've reported Tiger Woods. I followed that guy all the time when I grew up', the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics of one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only after Jack Nicklaus.
The American team fought the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level tournaments throughout the season.
The American leader, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team: 'I'm proud of these boys, they've fought.
Soon this morning, we have made Europe a little more difficult.
We're offering opposition.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their leader.
You have to take your hat off for the opponent.
We're overplayed."
Red glass update: Concentrations take off in the provinces Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
