“Good luck, I didn’t do anything, but I saw a terrible picture when people tried to break windows so that they could disappear.
People had a lot of glass on their seats, but the windows didn't.
One of the glass finally burst and they started to slip through the window," said the surviving Franciszek Kowal.
The stars emit light and heat because by connecting (slowing) hydrogen atoms to form heavier elements, energy is generated.
Scientists aim to create reactors that can produce energy in the same way.
However, this is a very difficult problem, and we will only see the useful synthesis reactor built after many years.
The clay needle shall float on the surface of the water due to surface tension.
Surface tensions occur because the water molecules on the surface of the water draw much stronger than the air molecules above them.
The water molecule on the surface of the water consists of an invisible film that allows the needle to float on the surface of the water.
The modern-day blades have two ribs, between which there is an entrailment. Two ribs allow better fit into the ice even on the back.
Since the bottom of the axles is slightly bent, the blade that touches the ice also bends to one side or the other.
This allows the rider to make a move. If the trigger is pushed to the right, the trigger is turned to the right, and if the trigger is turned to the left, the trigger is turned to the left.
In order to return to the previous level of energy, they must remove the additional energy they have received from light.
They do this by reflecting a small light part called a photon.
Scientists call this process "privileged in light radiation" because light stimulates atoms, which is why light photons are reflected and light is a type of radiation.
The next picture shows photon radiation atoms. Of course, photons are much smaller in reality than in the picture.
Photos are smaller than particles that make up atoms!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the fire extinguisher finally burns and the lamp no longer works.
The lamp must then be changed. The lamp must be changed carefully.
You must first turn off the lamp switch or turn off the switch.
This is important because in a blister containing a metal part of the lamp, the electric current can cause a strong electric shock if you slide the inside part of the blister or the metal base of the lamp until it is at least part of the lens.
The main organ of the bloodstream is the heart; it pumps the blood.
The blood comes from the heart with blood vessels called arteries, and the heart is returned with blood vessels called veins. The smallest blood vessels are called capillaries.
The trieratops’ teeth could be broken not only by leaves but also by very hard roots and roots.
Some scientists believe that the trieratops ate cicumuns, such as plants that were spread during the period of bedtime.
These plants are similar to a small palm tree with sharp, large leaves.
Perhaps the trieratops used their powerful blade to rub off all the leaves before eating the rock.
Other scientists claim that these plants are highly poisonous, so it is unlikely that anyone who eats dinosaurs will eat them, even though today’s insects and other animals, such as frogs (dinosaurs’ offspring), may eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
If you would stand on the surface of it, you would weigh less than the earth.
A person weighing 200 weights (90 kg) on the earth weighs about 36 weights (16 kg) so gravity, of course, attracts you less.
The sun has no flesh on which to stand, like the earth on it. The sun is full of gases, fire, and plasma.
The gases become more intense as they move away from the center of the sun.
The visible outer part of the sun is called a photosphere, meaning "lightball".
After some three thousand years in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo noticed that Venus has phases like the Moon.
The phases exist because only one side of Venus (or Moon) is lit up – the one that turned to the sun. The Venus phase supported Copernicus' theory that the planets revolve around the sun.
A few years later, in 1639, English astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks observed the phenomenon of Venus transit.

There are many theories of Sanskrit’s origin. According to one of them, migration from the west to India has brought its language.
Sanskrit is an ancient language similar to that of Latin used in Europe.
The oldest book in the world, of course, was written in the Sanskrit language. After the Spanish collection, the Sanskrit simply disappeared because of the hierarchy.
The continent is a very complex and rich language, which has become a source of many modern Indian languages (as well as Latin, which is a source of European languages such as French and Spanish).
After the French invasion, Germany began preparing for the invasion of the British island.
Germany called the operation a code name "Sea lions". Most of the heavy weapons and stocks of the British army were lost evacating from Dunkirk, and the army was quite weak.
But the Royal fleet was still much more powerful than the German fleet ("Krígsmarine") and could destroy any invasion fleet sent to pass Lamanša.
However, very few of the Royal Shipships were based on unlikely invasion routes, for the Admirals feared that they would be destroyed during the German air raid.
First of all, let us explain the plans of Italy. Italy was mainly the "small brother" of Germany and Japan.
Their army and their fleet were weaker, although they had built four new ships before the war began.
The main objectives of Italy were the African countries. In order to occupy these countries, they needed a military exit site so that they could cross the Mediterranean and enter Africa.
To that end, they had to remove British bases and ships in Egypt. In addition to these actions, there was no need for Italian military vessels to do anything else.
Now about Japan, Japan, like Britain, was a state of the island.
Submersible vessels shall be such that they are designed to sail under water for a longer period of time.
The submarines were used in World War I and World War II. They were then very slow and had a limited range of shootings.
At the start of the war, they were mainly swimming on the surface of the water, but when they improved and began to operate more accurately for radar, the submarines were forced to be soaked that they would not be noticed.
German submarines were called "U Boat". German submarines navigated and managed well.
Since the Germans have successfully used submarines, they are not allowed to have much after the war.
Yes, King Tutanchamon, sometimes called the King Tutu or the boy, is one of the most well - known kings in modern times in ancient Egypt.

We know a number of Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Probably the most famous of these cultural personalities is the legendary blind poet Homer, created by two Greek literature masterpieces: the poem "Iliada" and "Odysa".
Sofoklis and Aristotle are still popular playwrights, and their tracks are among the world’s best literary works.
Another sound Greek is the mathematician Pythagorean, best known for his famous theorem, which describes the relationship between the vertical triangles.
The number of people speaking Hindi varies. It is believed to be between the second and the fourth most commonly used languages in the world.
The number of speakers in the native language depends on whether or not very closely related phrases are included.
It is estimated that there are around 340 to 500 million users in the language and 800 million can understand that language.
Hindi and Urdu words are similar but different; everyday topics can usually be spoken by users of both languages.
In the 15th century, the culture of Northern Estonia had a strong influence on Germany.
Some of the Germans were lonely and wanted to draw close to the local people, so they created a veritable language of the East.
It was based on a German alphabet, and a single word was added Õ / õ.
Over time, many of the German - speaking words came to life, and then the period of prosperity began.

In order to learn to create interactive media, standard, traditional skills and tools, acquired and managed through interactive learning (infrared, audio and video editing, speech development, etc.).
By taking interactive design you will have to reassess your assumptions about media production and learn non-linear thinking.
The interactive design needs to connect the components of the project with each other, but also have meaning as individual entities.
The lack of objects that alter the visual mind is that the number of lens complexity and lens elements needed to reach the distance range of the lens needs to be significantly more basic lenses.
This problem decreases as the producers of poultry achieve higher standards of poultry production.
This allowed the use of the approximate lens to take photos of the quality of which is equivalent to the quality, obtained by using the fixed focus distance lens.
Another lack of an objective with an optical enhancement function is that the maximum aperture (speed) of this object is usually lower.
It is therefore difficult to use non-synthetic targets without light under poor lighting conditions.
One of the most common problems in trying to convert a movie to a DVD format is that the image expands beyond the screen display limits.
Many televisions are produced to meet the needs of the general public.
For this reason, everything you see on TV was surrounded from the top, the bottom, and the sides.
This is used to cover the entire screen. It is called a screen that expands beyond the screen edge.
Unfortunately, when writing a DVD, its edges will probably also be broken, and if the subtitles of the video were too close to the bottom, they will not be fully displayed.
Traditional middle-aged elephants have long admired people’s imagination – a lot of people remember the rider’s struggles, the dramatic shifts and the King’s time.
Even standing in the midst of thousands of years of caves can easily imagine the sounds and scents of ancient battles, almost hearing canopies smoking on the rocks and swallowing the fear that sparkles from the ground.

A possible balance was a system that was used by European nations to maintain national sovereignty in all European countries.
The idea was that all European nations should have tried to prevent one of them from becoming powerful, so national authorities often replaced the allies in order to maintain balance.
The Spanish succession war was the first war, with the main object of the dispute being a force balance.
This has been an important change because the powerful Europeans have lost the title of religious wars, and therefore the Thirty Years' War is the last war called the religious war.
The festival of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed in 356 B.C.E. at the inauguration of Herostrata's temple on 21 July.

The plans of the Roman Empire contributed to medical progress.
The Emperor Augustus began to hire doctors and even made up the first body of medicine in Rome to be used after the slaughter.
The surgeons had knowledge of the various ruminants, including morphine obtained from apothecary seed extracts, and scopolamine obtained from larynx seeds.
They managed amputation to protect patients from gangrene, as well as tournaments and artery prints to stop the flow of blood.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire has reached great success in medicine and has acquired many knowledge that is important today.

As children are quite young, they begin to perceive racial and racial stereotypes, and these racial stereotypes influence behavior.
For example, if a child meets a racial minority that, according to stereotypes, does not succeed in school, he usually takes a bad course when he learns the stereotype related to his race.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States that currently has 54 million profiles.
These sites were of great interest, especially in the field of education.
These websites have positive aspects, such as easy identification of a class page, which may include blogs, video recordings, photos and other features.
This page can be easily accessed by providing only one website address, so that it is easy to remember and introduce students who may have difficulty using a keyboard or writing.
It can be adapted to be easy to read, as well as to add as many or as few colors as desired.
A lack of attention "is a neurological syndrome defined by three classical symptoms: impulse, exposure and hyperactivity or excess energy".
It's not a development disorder, it's a learning disorder, "from which 3 to 5% of all children, perhaps 2 million American children".
For children with a problem of activity and attention, it is difficult to focus on such things as learning, but they can concentrate on doing what they like, for example, playing games, watching favorite cartoons or writing words without distinction marks.
These children can cause a lot of problems, because they are "risking, bullying and opposing officials", in order to stimulate their brains, because this is not done in ordinary ways.
The problem is that other children do not understand why they behave like this, why they write, or do not understand that they are at a different level.
The above-mentioned change in the ability to acquire knowledge and learning has changed the basic rate of acquisition of knowledge.
Information was obtained in another way.It was no longer forced to remember separately, but more attention was focused on the ability to remember the text.
Renaissance has significantly changed the attitude towards learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands to move, maintain weight, or burn under trees.
The width and length of the fungus are similar to the width and the foot, and this shows that the weight of the fungus is maintained when walking on the curves.
The human part is shorter than the foot, the part is closer to the finger.
This splendour of the speculatory system reveals 2-3 million-year-old bone fossils.
Some people feel that a lot of and often a lot of artificial dreams can be very distressing.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of clear dreams that prolong the time between the restless sleep (REM) phases.
When the night is less of a REM phase, this state, when you actually sleep and the body recovers, becomes quite rare and it causes problems.
It's as if you'd wake up every twenty or thirty minutes and watch TV.
The effect depends on how often the brain tries to dream consciously at night.

Perhaps the most common type of tourism, which many associate with travel, is recreational tourism.
This is when people go to a place that is very different from their normal everyday life in order to relax and enjoy themselves.
Usually beaches, thematic parks and campsites are most frequently visited by holidaymakers.
If there is a place to be visited in order to know the history and culture of that place, such a kind of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different places visited by a particular country or can simply focus on one area.
In view of this activity, the colonists also encouraged the reinforcement.
The opposition groups of the New Hampshire team, led by Colonels John Stark and James Reedo, were 1st and 3rd.
Strong men took positions outside the fortress at the northern end of the colonists.
As a result of the avalanche, they quickly extended the dam to the northern end of the water border on the small beach.
Gridley or Starks built a pillar about 100 feet (30 m) away from the bow and indicated that no one would shoot until the soldiers crossed that boundary.

The colonies of crustaceans grow and also grow at different stages.
At the klojklinje stage, the legionnaire’s night shines, and the day stands to camp.
The colony begins a cliché phase when it decreases the food available. At this stage, the colony has made temporary blisters that are being changed daily.
Each of these clumsies or ticks continues for about 17 days.
What is the cell? The word cell is derived from the Latin word cell, which means "small room", and this term was first conceived by a man who examined the structure of the microscope.
The cell is the primary part of all living creatures, and all organisms consist of one or more cells.
Cells are the basis of everything and are so important in life research that they are often referred to as life building blocks.
The nervous system supports homeostasis by sending nerve impulses across the body, ensuring continuous flow of blood.
These nerve impulses can be sent to the body very quickly, thus helping to protect the body from potential danger.
Compared with other heavy storms, tornadoes cause damage in a small area, but they can destroy everything that happens on their way.
Tornads are exploding trees, draining them from the roof plates, taking them to the sky cars. Two percent of the best tornados remain for more than three hours.
The wind speed is 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
People have been producing and expanding their wings for thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were created in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
A combination of two lenses was used for these telescopes to make the distant objects appear both closer and larger.
Valuableness and selfishness will never disappear, and this is the nature of cooperation that, when the majority benefit, always, acting on their own, will benefit more in a short period of time.
Let us hope that many people will understand that the best long - term choice is to work with others.
Most people dream of the time when mankind will be able to go to a distant star, others wonder who, after all, third believe in the future or in another form of life that is possible on another planet.
But if this happens, it's probably not going to happen very quickly. The stars are so distant from each other that between the stars the "stones" runs the trillions of miles.
Will one day your ancestors stand on the ground of a foreign world considering their ancestors?
The animals are made of many cells. They eat and digest food. Most animals are moving.
The brain has only animals (though not all animals, for example, do not have brains).
Animals can be found anywhere on earth. They live underground, swim in the oceans and fly in the sky.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of the living organism.
The word "cell" comes from the Latin "cella", which means a small room.
If you look alive after a microscope, you will see that they consist of small squares or balls.
Robert Hukas, a biologist in England, saw small squares through the microscope in the box.
They looked like rooms, and he was the first to watch dead cells.
Chemical elements and compounds may be transferred from one state to another without changing.
The properties of nitrogen gas are the same as liquid nitrogen. The density of the liquid structure is greater, but the molecules are the same.
Another example is water. Its compound consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
Its molecular structure remains unchanged, whether it is gas, liquid or solid.
Although its physical state may change, the chemical composition remains the same.
Time is around us and it works all our activities, but it's hard to understand.
For thousands of years, researchers in religion, philosophy, and science have studied.
It is time for us to face the consequences of the events that lie ahead in the future.
The time can also be understood by comparing the length (long) of events.
You can select your own time by monitoring recurring cyclical events. cyclical events are all recurring events.
Photos and videos are being processed using computers today.
Useful animations can be created using computers and this type of animation is increasingly used on television and movies.
Music is often recorded using more complex computers in order to be able to process and mix sounds.
For a long time in the 19th and 20th centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Maori, who hunted huge birds of mya.
The theory then emerged that the Maori came from Polynesia and took over from the moratoriums of New Zealand by establishing an agricultural society.
However, the new data show that the mortars were a group of mammals living in the lower part of the country, moving from New Zealand to Chatham Island and establishing a peaceful culture.
In the islands there was another generation, Maori, who migrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves martyrs; there were a number of clashes, and finally the martyrs were destroyed.
People who have been involved for decades have helped us to assess our advantages and enthusiasm by openly pointing to difficulties and even failures.
We have received valuable insights into the past by listening to the stories of people, families and organisations shared and by some people who have had a positive or negative impact on the culture of the organisation.
Understanding your history does not yet mean understanding culture, but at least it helps people to understand how they fit into the organization's history.
In assessing the success and knowledge of failures, persons and all participating persons are better aware of the values, mission and driving forces of the organisation.
In this case, the memory and success of previous examples of business behavior helped people to open up new developments and give a new direction to the local church.
Such success has reduced the fear of change and has encouraged a positive view of change in the future.
Convergence thinking models are the methods of problem solving that are sought through a combination of different ideas or areas.
In this case, the focus is on speed, logic, accuracy, fact-finding, re-use of existing methods and the collection of information.
The most important aspect of such thinking is just one correct answer. You can only think of two answers: right or wrong.
Such thinking is related to certain scientific or standard procedures.
Such thinking can lead to logical thinking, trends, problems, and scientific tests.
People are the most advanced kind, best able to understand others.
This means that we can successfully predict what other people understand, intend to do, know, or want.
One of these abilities, the understanding of the intentions of other people, is very important. It allows for the possible uncertainty of physical action.
For example, if you saw someone smashing a car window, you would probably notice that this man was trying to steal a foreign car.
It would be assessed differently if you had left your car keys and tried to access your car.
MRT is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered by Felix Blochas (worked at Stanford University) and Edward Purcels (worked at Harvard University) in the 20th century.
Because of this resonance magnetic field and radio wave, the atoms are forced to release small radio signals.
In 1970, doctor and scientist Raymond Damadian found the basis for magnetic resonance images to be used as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent was issued, which was the first patent in the world, issued in the field of RTD.
In 1977 Dr. Damadian finished constructing the first "complete" magnetic resonance reader, called "unaccomplished".
Asynchronous communication gives time to think and react to others.

By using the Internet and the Internet, learners can always obtain information.
Students can also submit questions to the instructors at any time of the day and expect a rather rapid response rather than waiting for the next meeting to look into the eye.
Postmodern attitudes toward education when freely manifested by absolutes. There is no one good way to teach.
In fact, there is not one good thing to learn. Training takes place in the atmosphere between the learner and the knowledge presented.
This idea demonstrates our current experience regarding television broadcasts about how to do things for themselves, and information and training based broadcasts.
So many of us are beginning to watch any television show that informs us of a process or experience that we will never study and will not adapt to that knowledge.
We will never rebuild a car in which we will not build a fountain, we will not move to Peru to experience the old ruins, and we will not renew the neighborhood.
Because of the underwater fibre optic cable that connects with Europe, and the broadband satellite of Greenland has a good connection – the internet has 93% of the population.
You will probably have a wireless connection or a computer connected to the internet, and you will find an internet café or any place where the public wireless connection works in all locations.
As mentioned earlier, although the equinox is acceptable for the use of the United States, many peoples outside the United States, especially in Canada, view it as depressing.
Although you can hear this word from local citizens of Greenland, foreigners should avoid it.
The local residents of Greenland in Canada are called Inuit (inuit), in Greenland – Kalaalleq (influenza – Kalaalit), which is Greenland.
