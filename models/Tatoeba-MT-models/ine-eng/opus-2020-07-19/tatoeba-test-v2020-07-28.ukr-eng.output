I think Tom's a friend.
We didn't have much time.
I like to play cards.
He's a joke.
What's a computer?
I'm not illiterate.
Did you sing yourself?
What are you doing?
Tom decided to do it.
Your medication's ready.
I thought you were curious.
Well, every one of them, huh?
I was so excited that I couldn't sleep.
Tom's alive.
I was nervous.
Tom recently changed his job.
Tom refused to give Mary what she wanted.
Tom was sad.
She was a foreigner, and she was treated like a foreigner.
Karen went there alone.
Do I seem nervous?
The girl we saw waiting for someone at Tomâ€™s house is Mary.
Why don't you stop smoking?
We all make mistakes.
He wondered why his wife had left him.
I think I put on too much sugar.
Do you know how to jump on the cossacks?
I know how to do this.
Tom's daughter?
I don't have to cook dinner tonight.
I have something to say.
The hotel can accommodate 300 people.
That's why I broke the pie.
She can ask questions and answer them.
Tom said he had an alibi.
Tom has two girlfriends.
What does Tom do in Boston?
Tom didn't think Mary wanted to do that.
Tom and Mary were told that they were not ill.
I've got a lot of time.
One more, please.
I'm a member of the team.
I had a stroke last year.
Mom's busy preparing dinner.
Horses are useful animals.
Come back quickly.
He's incompetent.
Foma's been training.
He's impatient.
He's sure it's a test.
Tom voted for the proposal.
Tom told you how long it took him to do that?
Let's get started!
Attention!
I'm completely exhausted.
The prospects are not too bright.
I don't believe in anything supernatural, but I'm fascinated by the literary song of the devil.
It's sad she's not having enough experience.
I spent some time in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary named their son John.
I wonder if Tom's actually going to Mary's concert.
Tom said he did that last weekend?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us to sing.
Let's not do anything at all.
Tom wants his father buried next to his mother.
You think we wouldn't notice?
Your dinner was so delicious!
I just found a solution to the problem.
Tom promised me he wouldn't cry.
I'm a dejay.
I hate Christmas.
Was the money enough?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It's too expensive.
The child is lost.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You need to learn to refrain.
We're all right.
My wallet's stolen.
He knows a lot.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We're losing.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
Talk to me.
The air sphereâ€™s surface is a non-euclideal space, so it does not comply with the euclideal geometry rules.
The talks were successful.
I'm sorry about that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I tried to call you.
I never killed anyone.
Be honest and straightforward.
Hope is always there.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You're twice my age.
The journalist was stolen by terrorists.
I lost the ball.
I hate this city.
He lives in Tokyo now.
Programming languages are his hobbies.
I'm glad to hear that.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
How much time do you have in the watchhouse?
Tom's deaf.
So it's not like eating fish.
I don't like any of them.
Follow us.
Tom is writing to you very much.
Your doctor says you'll be fine.
You're a cop.
You want to know?
Tom needs to wash his clothes.
I need that money.
My orange tie.
Tom's gonna cry?
That's why it would be too high.
I have to help Mom.
His book inspired me.
Are you brothers?
It's not my idea.
You have a plan, right?
He's playing.
Tom's not in town.
I'm wearing my shoes.
The next year will be worse.
Mary in the yellow dress.
It's a bitter taste in love.
The meeting is over.
You should've done it last year.
I thought I couldn't do that.
I've got an old machine.
We understand why.
I'm going every year.
I felt helpless.
I like a teacher.
We went to the elevator.
Tom is a professional hockey player.
We went to the woods looking for insects.
These tables are different.
I saw her a week ago.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
Motherly love is greater than anything else.
He persecuted a thief.
I worked at the restaurant.
I'm not strong enough.
It won't be as boring as you think.
He accidentally put salt in his cup of coffee.
Tom forgot to tell you.
I'm interested in music.
I don't really want to eat right now.
The mirrors were scattered on the floor.
You're so weird.
The country is rich in natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a beautiful car!
She went to school.
Tom sat by the window.
Tom is the same as the rest of them.
Tom, I don't think I should do that.
Government debt is rising.
Why am I me, not you?
Tom is probably never going to do that.
It's a doll.
Save yourself!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is right now.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widow.
I read this story in a book.
Tom still got a bike?
Speak briefly.
Tom's smarter.
It was a difficult night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who could do that.
I'm a teacher.
You had a good time, didn't you?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends too much time online.
You're adorable.
Tom said he'd complain.
Let's meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't take it.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's leaving in 30 minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car.
We can talk.
The computer can count very fast.
You don't have to.
Excuse me, can I open the window?
What's the weather?
I'm 30 years old.
You won't be worried about that anymore.
Would you like some more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for lunch today?
You can't even change the vampires.
Are people still using webcams?
I wonder if Tom had ever asked Mary why she had quit school.
This word is borrowed from Greek.
Am I going to die?
I'm dying, so I want to see them.
He's sick.
Don't push.
The car's outside.
I was weak.
Please make me a cup of coffee.
Mary lost her money.
There's no rules.
Leila got pregnant very quickly.
He's not a liar.
Do you know how to make cheese salad?
Tom knew what Mary knew.
Tom's cooking breakfast.
There's no doubt that it's raining.
Tom did not mention Australia.
Clearly, Tom and Mary are more than just friends.
We really drove to Boston.
In Iceland, there are many volcanoes.
John's older than me for two years.
Better or worse, but television has changed the world.
I'm a little thick.
He answered my questions easily.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Tom's looking for something.
He's probably innocent.
I love children.
Who's left?
When does she come?
It's not my style.
Try to focus.
I'm so glad I did it yesterday.
Tom's still living with you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't throw stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a wizard.
Don't interrupt me when I'm talking.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you often meet him?
You'd like that.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She has wine.
You're gonna stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was two thousand years ago.
Tom's probably gonna do it.
It has to be the right color.
Tom's got a very strict mom.
After a short peace, the war was relaunched.
It's better not to trust that.
Just talk to Tom.
May I remind you of your promise?
The capital of the Netherlands is Amsterdam.
I don't understand your French.
What's this restaurant called?
Excuse me, couldn't you hand me the sugar?
Where is Tom planning to build his house?
"Where's my notebook?" "On the table."
I don't think there's gonna be any problems.
Tom broke up?
You need to hurry.
Green suits you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary plays football.
How does it work?
You're very handsome.
Hurry up, guys.
I'm fixing my shirt.
When does his return come?
I had a good rest.
He's no better than his sister.
Tom's gonna beat Mary.
I'm making too many mistakes.
He's not afraid of death.
It would be good if there were 28 hours at the time, wouldn't it?
Kobe is the city where I was born.
He would like this disaster not to happen.
We don't expect victory.
I don't have any money.
I'm not teaching here anymore.
We didn't find the boy.
Get on the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
That's why I need to call.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a dejay.
Soon Tom will learn how to swim.
What's wrong with how I did it?
They can catch fish.
Tom came out of the room.
I'm still doing this every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He got the first prize.
Tom teaches French.
I tried to contact her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thinks he can do it.
I don't have any books.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My job is very boring.
He, in effect, is a man of work.
Answer the question!
You need it in the hospital.
I can't find any backups.
It's a trick.
It's not Tom's asking Mary to do it.
He's got green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom often makes mistakes.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
I'm sorry, but that's true.
Is it true that Tom was never in Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, there was a Gran-Pri broadcast.
Tom's a daughter.
Don't remember.
I'm rich.
Have you considered amputation?
I was wondering what Tom wanted to do.
English is not my native language.
I had no friends in Australia.
You think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's the girl's name?
We shouldn't have let her go.
So don't do it again.
They live here for ten years.
Tom ran into Mary.
Her neighbor will take care of her children until she's gone.
I'm cooking right now.
Did you see Tom's passport?
You want to dance?
He's often late.
Do you remember that summer when Tom shaved his head?
Why did Tom do that?
I know the father of this girl.
This is my third marriage.
Tom can't go with us.
I got 30 points.
If I don't, Tom will be mad.
Aren't you a psychologist?
Don't you write that down?
The big tree fell on the road, and when I was on my way, it gave me a way.
I like Tomâ€™s company.
Not all the gold that shines.
I don't have a lot of friends.
Do you believe in the existence of a God?
I live in Boston.
Tom's blind since he was born.
He didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Aren't you getting bored?
What do you like about men?
Why do people still smoke?
I won't work for you.
I can do this for her, unlike you.
I'm a student, and he's not.
I was trying to do that.
I wrote a book.
Quiet, please.
I bought my son new sunstains.
I know Tom's wife.
She was born the same year as me, and now she's preparing for the exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Have you completed your homework?
Monday might be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
Maybe you should help, so paint the park.
Why do people act like big monkeys, and on the contrary?
Can you help me?
Mudak.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should go to the doctor.
I put the papers on the visa.
The snow is coming today.
She kept working.
The moustache broke when we got up.
Tom's driving.
If you ate less hamburgers, you'd probably be healthier.
Tom helped Mary.
Good choice!
Don't you want ice?
Mary's not coming, is she?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to be taken to the hospital.
I had to go personally.
Please show me how this is done.
Aren't you seeing anyone?
All the benches are busy.
I haven't made a decision yet.
What date is it today?
Where's Dad?
Lock the door.
I'm not talking to Tom French.
Apples don't fall far from the apple.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?
Grandpa is your father's brother or mother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She's got red eyes.
They're not coming back.
I was in the jeans.
I'll see you after the show.
I'd like to ask you a question.
It's my grandmother.
It's a whale.
This bag of mine.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined Satanâ€™s Church.
I still want to do this with you.
Tom doesn't have any money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
You don't mind?
I haven't seen you forever.
You're obviously right.
Whose books are they?
That's what you want to do, isn't it?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom walks out the dog twice a day.
Let me take a look at this book, Tom.
The main islands of Japan are the Hockeydo, Sikoku, Honsu, and Kusa.
You're probably very busy.
Tom doesn't have much money in the bank.
I think we should go now.
We didn't.
You think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I'm not gonna help you.
Get out of here.
I'm not great.
She closed her eyes.
No one can compare with him in tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you get that?
She committed suicide.
We've got our office computers.
We have to pay in due time.
Are you sure?
You think Tom's gonna die?
Aren't you planning on staying?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I still teach French.
Tom will do it right away.
Let's sing the song together.
Tom has three more books than I do.
You missed a lot.
I'm wearing boots.
You can count on me.
His book became the object of criticism.
This is going to be great.
I'm really scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
It's much worse.
I'm under the flies.
You didn't waste your time.
Who knows when Tom will do this?
Tom was a witness in Maryâ€™s case.
I thought you were gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
Can I ask you what your name is?
I wrote you ten letters.
What do we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You need to stop smoking.
I think Tom's cheating.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Can you play the script?
Can you give me the salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks French well.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
It was popular with both students and teachers.
You can't help with the tears of grief.
Tom's playing football and running.
You can go wherever you want.
We'll see Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom can't speak French?
He always sings when he takes a shower.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung his earpiece.
I'll be right back.
The church is at the bottom of the mountains.
Where's your assistant?
Why did I do that to you?
Another coffee, please.
Tom will try to convince Mary to do this.
He's calling you, Tom.
You have to tell him to do it.
He's talking to an expert with a little French accent.
It's not yours.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't care.
She's got nice manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom comes to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a lady's fiancÃ©.
I'll deal with it.
Have you found any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
You're a witch?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Let's go.
So you're gonna let me get out of here?
You're a good woman.
Hope is.
When I was a child, I was very shy.
Did he really move to Boston?
Tom extended Maryâ€™s beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?
Children grow up so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He went back to the hotel.
When did you get back from London?
Aren't you still cold?
The language carries the rules of their language deliberately, even without realizing them.
Tom's on vacation.
What if I press this button?
The designers put their guns on the elephant.
Nobody cares.
They tried.
Tom and Mary still here?
Tomâ€™s wife is Canadian.
Do you have any allergies?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary were unable to help me do this.
I'd like to take the money.
I'm holding Tom's hand.
They'll be all right.
Half of these apples are rotting.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
You should not worry about tomorrow's exam.
Tom voted?
I'll be back.
Tom won't make Mary do it.
Tom didn't even start.
Instead of going to school, he stayed home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the park.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You don't have to trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom still wants to come.
Don't run away.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where did you take the cannicles?
This year, did you receive a Christmas present from Tom?
I'm still a little bored at home, and so many things seem strange to me.
Sometimes I have a memory problem.
Where's Mom?
He recovered three hours after the accident.
You speak Macedonian?
You don't have to talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me now.
Is Tom all right?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
Do you know why?
Check the voice mail.
She speaks three foreign languages.
Tom's a little bit off the chart.
Tom's not a hero.
Can you catch a cab here?
Come on, you're gonna be late.
It's gonna be hard.
Is Tom always acting like that?
I like to play golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk so loud.
Our team needs your help.
You never miss.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It's working, you'll see.
She threw it away.
Tom's safe.
I finally got the water rights.
I'm not a student.
That's why it was bad for Mary.
I'm just looking at the news right now.
Tom checks the phone all the time.
How's your wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom's not rich, Mary's rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite handle.
Everyone's late, except me.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I don't plan on blowing up the boat.
Money won't smell.
Tom's got a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with the client.
I'm disappointed with your efficiency.
Didn't you have a car before?
Were you at work?
What are you learning?
I'm sorry I ate those scissors.
Hello.
Please write your name with a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She totally ignores me.
Tom's going to bed tonight.
I was talking.
She went to the airport.
She is studying Portuguese in Brazil.
What will you tell them?
How did you know it was going to happen?
What's there?
If natural language can be compared to a tree that develops over time, the experiment can be compared to a plastic tree that was made artificially.
They wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this expression?
I think Tom's staying in Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what he needs to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a nice garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you've just done your job.
We'll walk.
Tom said that's what happened?
I finally realized I wasn't in love with you.
You said 'cause I was joking?
So it was awfully boring.
Tom said I was nice.
I'll be in the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's impatient.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
What do you understand?
They suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Bring out the garbage.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Your sister's always great.
This will be very difficult to do.
The child was paralyzed with fear.
Do you like these perfumes?
How terrible!
Are you in a hurry?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him at work, you should take his youth into account.
We're sure it wasn't an accident.
It's his compelling idea.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom was reluctant to leave the room.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe that.
I was in a white dress.
Check again.
Tom has a son-in-law.
I know it's not gonna be possible.
Do you have any major pain?
Children imitate friends, not parents.
Tom's falling.
Tom wants to play with his friends outside.
Whatever happens, keep calm.
Tom sent Mary a message.
He's always happy.
When Mary arrived at the bus stop, the last bus was gone.
Tom's in the black coat today.
I'll wait till 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We usually spoke French.
Bananas are delicious.
They're eating.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
They're useless now.
Did you try to talk to them?
Doing so was much harder than it seemed.
Her friends laughed at her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I was saying.
I doubt Tom can win.
The Inplanetians are flying and taking our work away from us.
Don't worry.
Bell invented the phone in 1876.
Are you going on a train?
Tom said Mary was nice.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still asleep, aren't they?
So he still likes Boston?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad, and he didn't come back.
Get your toys together.
Doing so was much harder than it seemed.
I think I got it wrong.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You should do what Tom tells you to do.
I'm getting better.
Are these people crazy?
That's why it's interesting.
Have you finished your job yet?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's not hard to do that.
Tom's gone.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but higher than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the butterboats.
I never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
This box was heavy.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I still wanted to sell it.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would.
You missed something.
That's why I called right away.
You looked interested.
That'll help.
I'll sleep.
I told Mary in French that I loved her.
We really don't have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to reach his goal.
Ken's got two cats.
I realized what was wrong with me.
I love traveling.
The phone's not working.
That's what we want.
Tom in the sunglasses.
Tom's doing a good job.
All you have to do is click on the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can you get a suit for Halloween?
Tom's busy and he can't help you right now.
We don't have money.
He wants to see you as a student.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm getting hot.
Why don't you go to sleep?
Does Tom really think that someone is listening?
You don't have to!
Tom, you can say good.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I had to go before.
I met him by accident.
Why do you like her?
The problem is that solar energy is too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's got a cloud.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
Do you understand?
Tom wasn't rude to me.
How do I say "thank you" in Japanese?
She's asleep.
Tomâ€™s wife asked him to quit his job.
Can't you open the door?
Are you comfortable?
This table is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.
Don't you know how?
He adopted the orphan.
I was playing baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I got a free ticket.
You're such an impatient person.
What's going on here?
Tom said you speak French.
I did everything I could.
No, sir, it's free.
I am very interested in studying French.
It's all right with the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a flashlight that I could borrow from you?
I'm going to the store.
I don't believe anyone.
I'm glad you're satisfied with your job.
You work around here?
You admit it, don't you?
I have things tomorrow.
I don't care.
You're always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but grew up in Tokyo.
You're very materialistic.
I don't understand, and I'm not used to not understanding.
I share everything.
The options are obvious.
The only person Tom is talking about is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
It was canceled.
My country is densely populated.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom's okay.
I don't sleep well.
Don't you buy that?
Women are beautiful.
Wouldn't it be great if Tom did it?
Did you do that?
I'm having trouble sleeping.
Tom sometimes hates me.
I'm dancing pretty good.
You can ask Tom for help.

We lost three games in a row.
Tom really told you that?
The glasses themselves are somewhere in the garden.
We're trying.
Don't worry, she won't bite.
My phone number is two, four, six, eight.
Is there a nearby yacht stand?
I don't have time, I don't have money.
We can pay.
I think I did it wrong.
I'm looking for a book for kids.
I doubt Tom will come.
He doesn't care what others say.
Tom took the ball.
Why is life so difficult?
Some people are very tense.
I don't know how many years that's why.
Mary was the only girl at the club.
It's a complicated problem.
Mary's at work, isn't she?
I told him to speak French.
He's a teacher, isn't he?
Tom's surprised.
I tried to help you.
I wasn't trying.
No one's gonna take me to work.
Don't you want to have kids?
Tea without ice.
Philosophy is not a word you can learn in six months.
You want to lose weight?
Tom thought no one was looking.
My father's too busy to go for a walk.
This place should be visited twice.
I'm just going for a walk.
He sells cars.
They were my friends.
I found something very interesting.
I'm not afraid of your dog.
Did you live here?
Maybe Tom's tired.
I don't think we can do that.
Tell me because I'll call you.
We'll try.
Tom shared Maryâ€™s pain.
They're tired of playing.
I can't forget her smile.
I hope Tom didn't do what you asked him to do.
I don't like fish.
I'm not the kind of person I'm giving up.
I feel tired.
I have food.
Mary asked Tom to let her drive.
Tomâ€™s justification was sad.
Warsaw's cheaper than London?
I'm ashamed of my bad English.
Are you hungry?
How did you get out of prison?
You can't bring anything.
You're successful.
I have a sea pig.
You've got a blue face.
Who were you going to dance with?
Thank you for jumping all six files.
Tom died of tuberculosis in 2013.
Good job!
My whale is so sweet.
I like cake.
He looks exhausted.
Look, there's your train coming.
This is my watch.
What are you looking for?
Life is beautiful.
It wasn't easy.
You like chocolate milk?
Are you a ghost?
You have restored my faith in mankind.
How's your mother?
He doesn't believe in evolution.
I hurt my back.
Where did you work last year?
Your secret will be safe with me.
I'd be very proud of you.
He came personally.
I really want to eat.
Tom died the same year as Mary.
We went to the street.
I think exams suck education.
Very cold.
That's why you came back from Boston, right?
Did Tom believe that?
Actually, he was never in New York.
Tom thought that Mary and John might be involved in arms smuggling.
I was sober at the time.
Here's your hand.
Tom was waiting for Mary.
Rio de Janeiro was founded in 1565.
I'm going to Boston with Tom.
I don't think you can do that.
First, you have to understand yourself.
I was there yesterday.
I'll wait here until he comes.
Tom can drive.
I read the novels of intent.
I was going to say that, but I forgot.
I'm a hero.
They love us.
I really need your help.
Tom betrayed you.
I got up around six.
I don't want to boast, but I'm pretty smart.
Does that matter?
Can I give you a minute?
Tom may not even be on the team.
I wonder if that's why you can trust me.
What's wrong with her?
Are you drinking?
I was angry.
When did he get here?
Where's your dirty bear?
How you doing, Tom?
Maybe this year we will finally win the European Cup.
Where could Tom do that?
I think you're wrong.
I'm careful.
Do you have a passport?
I tried to forget my wallet.
Cats catch a mouse.
You can go.
Tom said he didn't mind doing this for Mary.
Where's Tom going?
I'll call them myself.
I forced Tom to do it.
What miracle would Tom want to do?
Birds can see the earth's magnetic field through their eyes.
You need a car?
It's Tom's signature.
What really happened here?
Oh, my God!
Don't come in, I'm naked.
Are you planning on doing this?
Am I clear?
I'm free today.
Tom is probably punished for what he did.
No matter what, Tom is happy.
There's no need to hurry.
Are you satisfied?
At first, I didn't believe him.
The phone's not working right now.
Tom and his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Come in, please!
Get inside.
Tom can be punished if he does.
I know you're not an idiot.
I'm the strongest.
It's really crazy.
Tom is my older brother.
Tom told Mary that he saw John in January.
You always get up early, don't you?
She's going to oppose herself all the time.
They live in the same state.
My dog follows me wherever I go.
Thank you for your help.
Tom said he didn't want to die.
I wouldn't do that in your place.
Tom's already in French.
The earth passed from father to son.
There's no trunk without the blades.
I hope it's not them.
Don't drink too much, okay?
Wait for a surprise tonight.
You'll never be alone.
Why should we not do that?
There's nothing to celebrate.
I like watching TV.
He left the family.
Let's go?
I don't need to get in touch with Tom.
I'm bored.
I'm the chief.
Tom didn't make it.
You should go home by 9 o'clock.
Tom and Mary danced all night.
Tom admitted that he did.
Tom can't drive.
Tom spent the day with his daughter.
Each student has his own port.
We were ready.
I'm worried about what they can do to me.
My family lives here.
Tom's listening.
It came out of my hands.
Tom speaks French well.
I know I've learned a lot.
I went fishing on Monday.
Mary loved her dog.
The party's over.
The unicycle has one wheel.
"Daddy, look there, shark!" "It's a whale, Tom."
I know you're hiding something.
People always say I'm very friendly.
I'm a botan.
I think Tom knows something.
It was my fault, not Tom.
The congregations have gone quite well.
At this time of year, the wind blows from the ocean.
I saw Tom smiling.
Hyda, let's go!
I'm sure he's an honest person.
Tom has a surprise for Mary.
I never mentioned that.
Go and kill this hooligan.
It's our car.
Hi, I'm Bashir!
Tom bought Mary a rose.
I'm ashamed I did it.
Should I go to the hospital?
In her free time, she makes dolls.
I think Tom sings the country music better than any of my acquaintances.
He's drinking a moderate amount of coffee.
What does Tom want to do?
I can't pay them today.
She doesn't care how she's dressed.
Did you see his new movie?
I'm good at it.
Why did he give up?
Tom said Mary was gone.
I don't have enough money to buy it.
Mary said she wasn't sick.
If you want.
We have suppliers.
My unbiased idea is that it's a horrible movie.
You're very elegant.
Whatever you want.
I could change.
It's important.
Are you trying to be nice again?
Tom doesn't trust us.
She's in Tom.
Tom was a Bosnian.
I did everything I could.
If you see an error, correct it, please.
We tried again, but we didn't.
I wanted to talk to my lawyer.
I'm not sure if you're ready to do that.
I think Tom and Mary are right.
You should help her.
I'm crying. You don't cry.
He did his homework on his own.
It was a hot day.
I need a vacation.
We want to go up that mountain.
Tom missed lunch.
You speak well in English.
He loved his parents.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom's not very organized, is he?
I'm looking for someone who speaks French.
How often do you do that?
I hope you'll be back.
Tom wants to be a baseball player.
Love cannot be bought.
If you didn't want to come, you had to say something.
I'm ready to work.
What the hell is this theater?
Did you see the white?
Mary told her that Tom had told her.
Tom was not a very good witness.
I visited my grandmother.
I hate weddings.
I heard the front door burst.
I'm not following you.
Mariak dances beautifully.
My grandfather is from Osaka.
I want a massage, I need to relax.
Tom's such a lucky guy.
Why are you doing this, Tom?
I think so.
Did you sleep?
I was very sincere.
I'm not sure who did it.
What do you think, when Tom's here?
Is the snow coming tonight?
Do you mind if I give it to you?
Are you seeing someone here?
I live in Milan.
When did she do something for me?
I ate orange.
The square root of two is an irrational number.
He's small.
Didn't you know it was going to happen?
Bad thoughts lead to bad actions.
Did you bring the fan?
Tom's not wrong.
Do you have a report from this computer?
Tom seems a little shy.
We can't go without water.
I can't get along with my thoughts.
Tom came to talk to Mary.
She lives in the village.
I would never give up.
I speak French freely.
Tom wasn't wasting his time.
Help me.
You're disgusting.
I think I could help them.
I'm going to work.
He drank a lot.
Tom says he's satisfied.
How do you feel now?
How many boys in your class?
It's a big apple.
Choose the gift carefully.
I'm going with her.
Why would you do something like that?
The richest man in the world could not buy his love.
Where did they go?
What do you want from me?
I need new tires.
The absence of the news is good news.
Why are you late this morning?
Computers will save us time.
Do not interrupt our conversation.
You're obviously sick.
You were in London three times.
I'll be back.
Tom didn't see you.
I'm walking slow.
After the movie, they fell asleep.
I started coughing.
We'll get married in June.
I wonder if Tom left Boston.
I threw my bones away.
The book lacks a number of pages.
I raised the coin.
I have to go to the meeting.
Tom never violates his promise.
We need to protect ourselves.
You know that Jamal and Sarah don't get too close to each other.
Every student has his own party.
I spent twelve hours.
I'll be sorry about that.
I'm not sure Tom's telling the truth.
It's none of your business.
Don't go.
Tom doesn't have any effort.
I learned to get a cow.
I'm thirsty.
I'm sorry I'm not rich.
The news really upset her.
I've got a lot of time.
With the New Year!
You'll see for yourself.
I never killed anyone.
What's your name?
She's holding flowers in her hand.
Have you talked to him yet?
We're used to it.
I'm nine years old.
This coffee is so hot that I can't drink it.
Where did you get that?
Are we done?
You from Boston?
Have you known her since 1990?
You're doing well, aren't you?
These apples are delicious.
Can I have your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
Tom's special.
You're not a doctor.
I was afraid to say no.
She's got red blood.
What happened?
I owe you $10.
Listening to music is my favorite way of rest.
We were ready to attack.
When does the celebration take place?
Did you help?
Are you a cop?
Tom didn't do anything we told him to do.
You didn't see him.
I know Tom told us the truth.
Tom heard that Mary was married.
I've learned a lot.
How much does this parasol cost?
They were both different.
What happened?
It's possible to do that.
Tom thinks Mary's exhausted.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
Everyone in Tom's class was infected with flu.
Remember when you first heard the Beatles?
Did I hurt Tom?
I want you to come to my party.
No toilet paper.
Word is silver, silence is gold.
Please sit here and wait.
I love this football.
Drink water from the stream.
I'm usually more busy than Tom.
I moved last month.
Tom, he'll probably still be mad.
I'm going to the airport.
Don't pay attention to her instincts.
I'm glad Tom will help us.
Tom's gonna be here for a minute.
I'm glad they're both on our team.
Where can we sit?
You like chocolate milk?
I always keep my word.
How much time does it take?
Tom, are you okay?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I will see you again.
He didn't suspect anything.
I invited her to a date.
Are you Japanese?
Tom looks scared.
When did you get to China?
Do you approve of what Tom is doing?
Tom showed Mary the house.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
It's a perfect opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary that she had to do it.
I don't expect them to win.
I slept.
How is that my fault?
With regard to Switzerland, have you been driving there for winter?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It's getting better.
I'm studying Vietnamese.
I'll meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay off his debt.
Try to look at it from Tom's point of view.
The window has been opened.
No one thinks so.
I took off my shoes.
Help me.
Tom couldn't find a place to park.
You'll be happy.
Tom had a pretty sick look when I saw him last.
Tom's still seeing Mary?
You didn't even smile.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
You think you're funny?
I usually work from ninth to fifth.
Let me take care of this with you.
Mary watched a romantic comedy.
Grab him!
Someone knocked at Tom's door.
Tom's such a fool.
You want more potato powder?
Tom sat down.
Tom's got a nose.
I have three questions for you.
I met Tom several times.
Are you using a text processor?
Tom and Mary do a lot together.
Please move.
What are you doing this evening?
Why did you paint a spoon in red?
No, it's not my house.
You speak French freely, right?
As you wish.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
You can't speak French, can you?
You're not.
Let's go home.
I greeted Tom.
Tom took off his lunch.
I'll arrange breakfast for you.
Tom was listening.
Who broke this window?
Your ideas are a bit old.
