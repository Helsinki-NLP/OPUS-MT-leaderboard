The members of the Valuing Congregation are concerned that they are "like Mupetka"
Some members of the congregation were threatened with the proposal to appoint MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, etc.) after a new term.
This was due to plans to change the name of the congregation to the Valianian Parliament.
Members of the congregations in the whole political spectrum are concerned about smiling.
A member of the Laburist Congregation said that they were cared for in their group, "which is the name of the Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: in the suitcase, twp means crap and pwp to pop.
A member of the assembly from Plaid Kimru said that their group as a whole was "not satisfied", and proposed other options.
The Valijan Conservative said that his "open spirit" group was about to change the name while pointing out that between the words MWP and Muppet there was a small difference in the statement.
In this context, the expression ‘w’ is similar to the word ‘u’ in the Yorkshire word.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing a draft legislation for the presentation of amendments to the name, said: 'The final decision on possible descriptors for members of the assembly will of course have to be adopted by members themselves'.
The Valijan Congregation has been authorized by the Government of Wales Act 2017 to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Valijan Parliament.
For members of the assembly, the Commission has chosen the name ‘Welsh Parliament Member’ or ‘WMP’, but in public consultation it has received the most support ‘MWP’.
Members of the assembly obviously propose other options, but reaching agreement will be a difficult task for President Elin Jones, who has to present a draft legislation on amendments within a few weeks.
Reform laws will also include other changes in the way the congregation operates, including rules on the incompatibility of the functions of members of the congregation and the establishment of a committee system.
Members of the assembly will participate in the debate on legislation in the final vote on their appointment.
Macedonians will decide by referendum to change the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday to change the name of their country to 'North Macedonia'.
They wish to resolve a ten-year long dispute with the neighbour of Greece, who has his province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbours represents the right to their territory and has repeatedly opposed its request for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not take the votes.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including the President of Zoran Zaev, claim that the change in the name is the price they have to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells in the church of St. Martin’s have been silenced because the churches in Harlem are facing problems
“The older people I spoke to say that they used to be bar and church on every corner,” Adams said.
‘Today neither one nor the other’.
He explained that the disappearance of the bar is understandable.
"People are different today.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of neighbors where people start regularly.’
In churches, however, he is concerned that money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that soon they will be back in the beginning.
He added that the churches could exchange housing buildings with common administration (condominium) where people who would not help shelter in the neighborhood that remained.
“Many people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and that is why the day will come quickly when all these churches will be closed, as it is unlikely that people who move to these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built Belgian religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s decade later.
The original Belgian Methodist Church community moved in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by the black religious community that served more closely.
St. Martin’s took over the Black Church community under the leadership of Honorary John Howard Johnson, who on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, led a boycott of sellers who did not want to hire or support the dark police.
The fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but when the parishioners planned to rebuild Johnson’s father, they ordered the bells to run.
Honoring David Johnson, the son of his father Johnson and his successor in the church of St. Martin’s, he proudly called the bells “the bells for poor people”.
The expert, who was involved in July, called them a little different: ‘cultural foundation’ and ‘unreplaceable historical instrument’.
Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first bells to be played by a dark-haired musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to the Church of Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he was calling on larger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said that he was not replaced in the church of St. Martin’s.
In the church of St. Martin’s, in the last few months, a complicated story has been carried out with architects and contractors; some have brought the church’s time, while others have the bishops.
Zacristi – the administrative body of the parish, composed of time – wrote to the bishops in July that she was concerned that the bishop would "try to carry the costs" to the parish, although the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the transparency of the shed.
The Marine Dog injured a 13-year-old while hunting lobsters in California
Officials report that on Saturday, the California Marine Dog attacked and injured a 13-year-old lobster hunter at the opening of the lobster fishing season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. in the vicinity of the Beacon’s Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the TV KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning, about half an hour he drowned with his friends when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then with the group he sailed to him and helped him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that first he thought the boy was just excited because he caught the lobster, and then he realized that he was screaming "He bit me!
He bit me!"
When he came to the boy, Hammel noticed he had a broken entire key.
"I have every thought of going out of the water: "There is a sea dog in the water!" he added.
The boy was transferred with a helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The type of marine dog responsible for the attack is unknown.
The water saver, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press statement that a few weeks earlier, a marine dog had been observed in this area, but it was found not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe damage to the upper part of the body.
The responsible persons were prevented for 48 hours from accessing the beach Ponto Beach in Casablanca to the beach Swami’s in Ecinitas for investigation and security.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of marine dogs in this area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s comes in Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with beautiful corners, as they have in the lobbys, and with expert staff.
As part of the entry into the British beauty market, worth GBP 2.8 billion and is still growing, while selling clothes and household appliances falls, more beautiful corners will be tested in 11 shops per country, and in more shops next year if they prove to be successful.
They decided to invest in beautiful products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill out the poles used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
At Sainsbury’s, they say that they will double the offer of their beauty products to 3,000 products and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing offer of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space in areas with trademarks similar to those in stores such as Boots.
Supermarket also revitalizes its botanical offer of cosmetic products, so that most vegan products – something that younger buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury’s shops. The first week was opened in Croydon in southern London, and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham until the end of the year.
Due to online purchases and daily purchases of small quantities of food in local stores, supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said that retail shops would be similar to wholesale shops because the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl discounts with multiple services and non-food products.
The Sainsbury’s group has opened the Argos outlet in several hundred shops and also Habitat trade since it bought both chains two years ago, which has increased food sales, and the takeovers have been more profitable.
The past attempts by the supermarket to renovate their parts with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products ended unsuccessfully.
Sainsbury’s was a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 21st century, but the bond ended after the dispute over the sharing of drug profits in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical company with 281 sales to Celesio, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy three years ago.
They announced that Lloyds would play a role in this plan, as they would expand in four shops the offer of luxury brands for leather, including the La Roche-Posay and Vichy brands.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the appearance and impression of our beautiful points and thus improved the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who will be available for advice.
Our brand offer is designed to meet all needs, the attractive environment and the convenient location means that we are now an interesting destination that is a challenge for the old way of buying."
Peter Jones 's angry 'cause Holly Willoughby got away from work worth 11 million pounds.
The star plays Dragons Day (Good Business) mad because the TV leader Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from work worth 11 million pounds, with his trademark of life-style to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand clothes and Truly's accessories.
The company was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The head of this morning's show, 37, announced on Instagram that he's gone.
Holly Willoughby angered the Dragons Dan Peter Jones star, as she recently withdrew from their lucrative work with a trademark of the lifestyle to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The Viri say Jones was "barred" when a golden television girl on Tuesday during a tense meeting at his Marlow's office in Buckinghamshire admitted that due to his new business – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – there is no longer time to dedicate their trademarks to True clothes and accessories.
The company compared the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and predicted that it would double its assets estimated at GBP 11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones fled from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source says: "Truly was far more important to Holly.
It would be her long-term future to survive the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw completely dubbed all involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was going on, because the opening was so close.
A warehouse full of goods prepared for sale is located in Marlowa’.
Experts believe that the departure of the leader of this Morning, which is among the most interesting links for banks in Britain, would have cost the company more than a million because of the large investments in products, from lasins and candles to clothing and accessories, and additional delays in opening.
Moreover, it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were a good friend of ten years with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby set up True together with Cappovo in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
In addition, Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I’m A Celebrity's I'm.
The source near Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business matters."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
He complained about the criticism of the media because of a comment that some feel to be “unprecedented” and a positive opinion on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up like that?
With his grinning ‘newer’ voice, Trump said:
"I didn't give up anything."
He stressed that Kim showed interest in the second meeting. Her first meeting in Singapore in June marked Trump as a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see the "response" of the US to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He stressed that instead of this, the United States continues to be subject to sanctions that continue to exert pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his contract.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
But now we have a good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kimo led to positive results – they stopped testing rockets, helped free hostages and brought home the afterlife remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in talking about relationships with Kim.
"It can be very Presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded theater, we have 200 people standing here," Trump said and pointed to the crowd directly in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island, more than a hundred dead
For example, when dealing with the consequences of the disaster in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok have been displaced, natural disasters have not been declared, which is a condition for sending international aid.
“In many cases it was very clear that they did not require international aid, so the situation was somewhat complicated,” Sumbun said.
The Save the Children is a team that will travel to Pala, but it is not clear if foreign personnel can help on the ground.
Sutopu, a representative of the National Disasters Agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu and ascertaining whether they would be able to help international agencies.
In view of the fact that the earthquakes in Indonesia are at stake, the state remains totally unprepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh they built shelters after tsunami, but on the other hand, this is not common practice.
The apparent absence of a warning siren for tsunamis in Palu may have contributed to the loss of life, although the warning was valid.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands is also a challenge at the best of times.
Because of natural disasters, logistics is even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which is to help victims of the earthquake in Lombok, swims against Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the scene of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put the improvement of destroyed Indonesian infrastructure ahead of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit is a problem for the Jokov administration in re-election next year.
Yoko is also faced with the pressure of long-term tensions among the sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and more than ten thousand were evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim armies fought on the streets with swords, bows, and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge score for late settlement against Chelsea
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool in 89 minutes before defeating Chelsea in the 1st English league.
Sturridge has accepted the delivery of Xherdan Shaqiri of good 25 meters before Chelsea's goal while remaining his team 1-0.
He gave the ball to his left and shot at the remote door.
The arrow traveled high above the criminal space against the right upper corner of the neck.
The ball finally went down through the door of Kepé Arrizabalage and fell into the goal.
“I’ve simply tried to get to the right position for the ball and players like Shaq, always drag it as far as I can, so I’ve only tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch I didn't think much more and decided to shoot."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the afternoon with the hit of the Belgian player Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
In this fifth action, the Blue Attacker gave the ball back to Mate Kovacic and fled to Liverpool's half.
He put the money in the middle quickly and got ahead.
Then he gave it through the defense and Hazard fled to the prison.
Hazard took the lead in the defense and shot his left leg against the remote door through the Liverpool gater Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet Naples in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 p.m., at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, in the group part of the League of Champions.
Chelsea is waiting for videoton in the League of Europe on Thursday at 3 p.m.
The number of deaths of tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832 and the state accident agency reported on Sunday morning.
A representative of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told the press conference that many people had been affected by a fifth-grade earthquake of 7.5, which triggered six-metre waves captured in the ruins of buildings.
The palace, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is a wasteland of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for murder after a woman was stabbed to death
Police launched a murder investigation after they found a woman's body in Birkenhead in Merseysid this morning.
A 44-year-old with stab wounds was found at 7.55 in the Grayson Mews building on John Street Street and arrested a 32-year-old man for murder.
The police are calling on everyone who was in the area and who saw or heard a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in the initial phase, but I invite everyone who was near John Street Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious about getting in touch with us.
I also call on all, especially taxi drivers who may have caught something on camera footage to get in touch with us, as they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
The police representative confirmed that the woman was Birkenhead, and they found the body inside the property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the crime scene and asked where they found her this morning.
The investigation is under way, and the police inform the women's property.
The cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
When he found out what happened, he was left speechless.
The residents were now told that it could take several hours before they could reenter.
Police heard him explain to the man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
It goes on to say, "It's so horrible."
At 2:00 a.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon, and another one outside immediately.
Several policemen stood inside the cordon and observed the housing block.
All who have any information request that they write to @MerPolCC call 101 or anonymously contact the company Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and enter the journal 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has become the most recent memory target of the dispute about "rewriting history"
His removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical followers of puritanism.
But Cromwell Society has designated Crick's proposal as "absoluteness" and "an attempt to rewriting history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s debate on the removal of the statues, it became clear that Oliver Cromwell’s image outside the West Minister’s palace would become a target.”
An iconoclassism in the English Civil Wars Cromwell did not even carry out orders.
Maybe he's going to be a victim of his predecessor from the past century.
A brilliant presentation by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of the 19th century, Cromwell, is a part of the history of a personality that some believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell's numerous (maybe even more late in the 19th century than today) are seen as parliament's protector against external pressure, in his case, of course monarchy.
But it's a very accurate performance, it's the subject of continuous historical discussions.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our people, and Cromwell is a recognized individual who represents one side of this division.
His achievements from the time he was Lord's protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
Killer pig killed a Chinese peasant until death
After reports of local media, a Chinese pig attacked and killed a farmer on the market in southwestern China.
A man who was identified with only the "Yuan", found a dead man with a cut artery and a blood clot near a pig market in the town of Liupanshui in Guizhou province, was reported on Sunday at the South China Morning Post.
The pig breed is being prepared for the vaccination of pigs at the pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
After reporting, she and her siblings were supposed to travel from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big pig's male in the pighouse with a bloodthirsty goblin.
The forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig killed the farmer until death.
“Brothers’ legs were bloody and mutilated,” the cousin with the title “Wu” was quoted as saying in Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage showed that Yuang came to the market on Thursday at 4.40 p.m. to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pigs were closed so that they wouldn't attack anyone else while the police were collecting evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and market manager are supposed to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rarely reported, cases of swine attacks have been reported.
In 2016, the pig attacked the woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, with a man suffering serious bodily injury.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig pressed the rolling farm at the tractor, but then the woman snatched the animal.
After the pigs ate the farm from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba for CBC News said that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "launcher".
"We'd just play.
They're like little children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
They just need to show them a sufficient degree of respect," he said.
South-west U.S.A. due to the remains of the Rosa hurricane, heavy rains are coming
According to the predictions, Orkan Rosa is moving against the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico and weak.
But in the coming days, Rosa will bring the rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
From Sunday from 5.00 a.m. to the east time, Rosa is category 1 with wind speed 137 km/h and is located 620 kilometres south-west of Punta Eugene in Mexico.
She's expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, above the Pacific Ocean, the area of low air pressure is strengthened, moving east towards the western coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm and will suppress high tropical moisture against the north to the south-west of the United States.
Rose will bring up to 250 mm of rain in the parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then a tropical moisture mixed with a low air pressure area will create heavy rainfall in the coming days in the wider south-west area.
Locally between 25 and 100 mm of rain will result in dangerous flooding, flooding and the possibility of land use in the desert.
Due to high tropical moisture, the amount of rainfall in some places will be approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in the parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-west parts, especially above the larger part of Arizona, there is expected to be between 50 and 100 mm of rainfall.
Floods are possible due to the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the widespread nature of the tropical rain.
A very thoughtless step would be taken to the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn cannons into river basins and storms will bring local wind and dust to the air.
The approaching low air pressure area will bring local rains to the south coast of California.
Rains above 12 mm are possible, which may result in lower precipitation and off-roads.
This will be the first rains for the region in the rainy season.
A few scattered tropical vessels will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday afternoons and Monday mornings, late Mondays and Tuesdays will spread.
Heavy rains will spread across the sky on Tuesday and will also take place on Wednesday.
In the United States, in October, large temperature fluctuations can occur, as the Arctic cools, and tropical areas remain very warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
The week is an excellent example of the dramatic difference in temperature in the central part of the United States.
Between Kanas City in Missouri and Omaho in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, there are 20 degrees of difference.
In the next few days, summer temperatures will try to stop and expand again.
Most of the Central and Eastern US will enter the warm October with temperatures around 27 °C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the north.
In New York we could have 27 °C on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term forecast shows good possibilities for temperatures above the average for the east of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people on the six television networks have seen an interesting fourth story of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman charged with a sexual assault in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political position continued, as television stations interrupted the regular program due to Friday's conversion in the last minute: an agreement by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, that the FBI would carry out a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Justice Committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh had dumped her in a guilty state and tried to drag her to high school.
Kavanaugh said in the burn story that he was 100% convinced it didn't happen.
Nielsen reports that more than 20.4 million people would see their testimony on Friday.
The company accounted for the average viewing of TV networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that gave their testimony, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems with the damage of the viewers who watch the program in the offices.
For a easier performance, watching is similar to playing the football game of the finals or awarding of the American Film Academy.
Televisy Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support the appointment of Kavanauch, leads to all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reports.
The second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
The interest also remained high after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican stated that he would vote in Kavanough's presence, CNN and CBS recorded on Friday morning that the protesters shouted at him when he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearings of the Justice Committee.
In a few minutes' time, he showed a view, which was captured alive by CNN TV cameras.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said some woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the state?
You have power while many women are weak."
Flake said that his office had made a statement, and he added that he would have more to say in committee hearings, and then the door was shut.
All television networks were also broadcast live hours later when the Justice Committee voted on the submission of the Kavanaugh nomination to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do it if they agreed that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate next week, to which the minority party of the Democrats called.
Flakea was in this part of a conversation with a friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decided because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes for the appointment of Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump initiated an investigation by the US Federal Investigation Office (FBI) regarding the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused criticism of "playing political games" in Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, criticised her plans for leaving the European Union 'playing political games' with the British future and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Therese May's arrival at a conservative party conference in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In a further interview with her on the cover of the magazine, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit Plan and said that it was a proposal that Britain and the EU pay the other customs "very absurd."
Shooting Waydea Sims: police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of death of the LSU team player
Police arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Waydea Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
After reporting to the Baron Rouge police, a 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison for a second-degree murder charge.
Officials published a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police indicated that during the struggle Sims lost his sunglasses.
The police found sunglasses on the scene and on them Simpson's DNA, CBS TV complements WAFB's TV reports.
After Simpson's hearing, the police made a statement that he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
Security is worth $350,000, the lawyer reports.
A mirror from the East Baton Rouge Parish district issued a previous report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the neck.
The police are grateful for the assistance of the investigation leading to the arrest of special units for the Lausiian state police, the criminal police lab, the South University police and the inhabitants of the area.
The director of the LSU Joe Alleva team thanked the local authorities for their "care and search for rights".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-centimeter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
The previous season, on average, collected 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps at the game.
On Friday morning, the coach of the LSU Will Wade team told us that the team was "struck" and "in shock" because of Wayde's death.
“That’s what worries you all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano ash in Ciudad de Mexico
The ashes that were blown by the Volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern vicinity of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano, as activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center has observed several cases of thunderstorms and earthquakes.
Photos on social networks showed thin layers of ash that covered the windshields of cars in the vicinity of the main city of Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysics have observed an increased activity in the volcano, which lies 72 kilometres south-east of the main city, after a 7.1 degree earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with the Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters supporting independence clashed with anti-police police units and thousands of people joined the rival demonstration, marking the first anniversary of the Catalan polarized withdrawal vote.
A group of masked separatist supporters, who kept anti-police police units, wrapped them with eggs and metal in dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually flooded with tourists.
Later, there were also fights, where policemen had to use hangings to stop the clashes.
Supporters of independence, who have been calling for many hours "no memory, no forgiveness", have faced Protestants who support unity and shouted "Let's live Spain!".
As local media reports, fourteen people in protests have suffered more damage.
The year after the referendum on 1 October, which was marked in Madrid as illegal and the Catalan separatists celebrated, tensions in the region supporting independence remain.
Most voters voted in favour of independence, although the participation was low, since the opposition to the withdrawal had greatly boycotted the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police tried to stop the vote on the polls in the region in violent conflicts.
Groups supporting independence camped at night in front of the polls to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take a different path.
68-year-old Narcis Termes, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said there was no hope that Catalonia would become independent.
“We had one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents crying out of happiness because they could, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although important, although close to the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties supporting independence are difficult to maintain this year's initiative, as many of the most well-known leaders are in voluntary exile or are awaiting trial because of their role in organizing a referendum and later declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest with the phone in support of the police, explained that the protests had defeated politics on both sides.
“Temployment is getting high,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders, who have been in detention since the end of last year before the start of the trial, announced that he will run for elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Courseing at European elections is the best way to condemn regression in democratic values and repression that we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: arrested men who flew into the house by car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years of age, were arrested because they took their car into Londonderry’s house several times.
The incident occurred on the street of Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19.30 after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said they were damaged by the door and the building itself.
At some point, they're supposed to shoot at the car with a single shot.
With the cover of Mengaya, Livingston won with 1:0 against Ranksom
Dolly Menga with his first goal for Livingstone won
Livingston was suspicious of Rangers and Steven Gerrard had to admit his second defeat in 18 matches as a coach of the Ibrox club.
The Dolly Mengai arrow made the difference, as Gary Holt's team was the same as the Hibernian team in the other place.
Gerrard's team thus lost the victory in the guests of this year's championship, and the next week they are waiting for Hearts, who lead on the ladder and behind them behind eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone has increased its series of failures in the six-game division and Master Coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet experienced defeat.
Livingston has made opportunities against direct guests
Holt's team should be running a long time before the strike, as with its direct presence, Ransom has caused many problems.
Scott Robinson made a breakthrough, but the ball sent through the door frame, then Alan Lithgow hit the door, and Craig Halkett shot his head through the goal.
The guests left the game Ranksom because they knew that the guests could be dangerous when the attack breaks.
And in this way, they also came to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingstone a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Mengai, who shot and beat out of the middle of the prison.
The Rangers had a bigger possession of the ball, but the domestic defenses couldn't break, and the doorman Liam Kelly didn't have much work to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos was defending Kelly.
The doorman of Rangers's Allan McGregor, with his foot, defended Scott Pittman's gun, and Lithgow was shot naked from another Livingstone stop in the attack.
The proposals continued to come to Livingstone's penal area, but the domestics refused all attacks, two violations – Halket's violation of Glen Middleton's replacement and a hand-playing violation – and the judge did not arrive.
“Excellent performance” Livingstone – analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Excellent performance and result for Livingstone.
They were all excellent and continue to exceed expectations in this way.
The game style and bets have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holta needs to be assigned credit for the way he woke up the team from his income.
The hero was big.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and made good provision for a well-organized defense, while Menga kept ready for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
However, there was a lack of inspiration.
Although under the leadership of Gerrard, they are severely lacking in these standards.
There was a lack of targets – only once they successfully defeated the host’s defense – and this is some kind of wake-up for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogana were accepted mixed in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leader of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue skyscrapers prevailed.
Today is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes about human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's approach to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 heads from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters were able to get closer to seeing their president.
Its opinion was also expressed by hundreds of Protestants – many of them Kurds – who do not support the Erdogan government and condemn Erdogan's policy and decision by the German government to greet him in the country.
Contrary protests reflect the separation of the visitor, whom some German Turks celebrate as heroes and others despise as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: the biker died in a car racing accident
There was a fatal accident in London during the race in which the car was involved.
An accident occurred near the crossroads between the streets of Bestywood Street and Evelyn Street, on a road in Deptford on the southeast of the city at about 10.15 after British summer time.
The car driver stopped and the rescuers arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The accident occurred only a few months after the bike died in a race in which the car driver fled, about 1.5 km from the accident on the Children Street street.
Police have made a statement that police officers are checking the identity of a man to be able to inform the owners.
They set up roadblocks and rerouted the bus lines and advised the motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six guards injured in an emergency
Six prison guards were injured in an emergency in a strictly protected male prison, reported by the prison administration.
Nered broke out in HMP Long Lartin's prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at approximately 9.30 a.m. after the British summer and is still running.
Police officers from the “Tornado” unit have been called to take care of an emergency involving eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
Less damage to the face was provided to the guards on the spot alone.
The representative of the prison staff said: “We have called a specially trained staff who will take care of the emergency in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members suffered injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the police will be responsible for this and may therefore be further behind bars."
In the HMP Long Lartin prison there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous perpetrators of crime in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was in hospital because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, they called the anti-police unit in prison to intervene in a serious riot in which the personnel were attacked with billiard bullets.
Orkan Rosa threatens Pheonix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, as the remaining energy of Orcana Rosa narrows the way through the southwest of the desert and brings the danger of sudden floods.
The National Time Service has already issued a warning to the sudden floods of Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, south and east Nevada, south-west California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Orkan Rosa is supposed to get mad at Phoenix on Tuesday, and he'll be approaching late on Monday with the rain.
The National Time Service in Phoenix stated that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 300 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Orkan Katrina (1967) was well within 60 km of Arizona.’
The latest models of the National Orca Centre provide 50 to 100 mm of rainfall with individual rainfalls up to 150 mm on Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest, including Rockies and Great Basin, it is expected that from 25 to 50 mm of rainfall, individual rainfalls up to 100 mm are possible.
For areas beyond the danger of sudden flooding, the rain of the Rosa hurricane may be a blessing because the region has been affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, part of the rainfall is likely to be useful, because in the south-west there is now a dry period.
“According to the US drought tracking centre, good 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought,” reports weather.com.
The path of Orcana Rosa leads first to the land of the Mexican peninsula Baja California.
Rosa, who still has the force of hurricane on Sunday morning at the maximum wind speed of 137 kilometres per hour, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenie in Mexico and moves north at 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm comes in contact with colder waters in the Pacific and therefore weakens.
It is expected that the land in Mexico will reach with the power of the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The falls in the parts of Mexico may be heavy and therefore represent a great danger of flooding.
“From the Baj California peninsula to the north-west of Sonora we expect 75 to 150 mm of rainfall with a 250 mm rainfall,” they reported on the weather.com website.
Orkan Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and against the south Utah until late Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger that we expect from Orcana Rosa or its remains is abundant rains in the north-west of Baja California and in the south-west American desert," said the Orcana National Centre.
These rainfalls can result in life-threatening sudden floods and floods in the deserts and land-times in the mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested for the sum of attempted murder after they found a 16-year-old in Somerset with stab wounds.
The early teenager was found in the Excellence Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4.00 after the British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, reports the Avon and Somerset police.
The cops are calling on everyone who may have picked up their cell phone to respond.
Trump said Kavanaugh was a "suffering and angry" democratic party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against intolerance and the unheard of tactics of a democratic party," Trump told the assembly in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was a "suffering and angry" democratic party in the process of its appointment.
Kavanaugh spoke in front of the convention on Thursday, with Christine Blasey Ford's accusations clearly and emotionally denied that he had been sexually assaulted by her in her early teens.
At the hearing, she also talked to Ford about her accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that the day “Americans saw the brilliantness, quality and courage of Kavanaugh”.
"The vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for the appointment of one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an exceptional record of public service," said many supporters in western Virginia.
The President specifically mentioned the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the electoral participation of Republicans in the interim elections.
"For five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I am really trying with the candidacy," he said.
"That's why I fight for excellent candidates everywhere."
Trump argues that democracy is on the mission of 'responsibility and obstruction'.
The first key procedural vote in the Kavanaugh meeting was to take place no later than Friday, the advisor of the Republican Party told CNN.
In the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami of hundreds of people killed, the number of victims increases
On Saturday, the authorities reported that in the earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people died, many of the giant waves that were on the coast were taken away.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Pala, when six-metre waves hit the coast and took many to death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
“When there was a danger of tsunami yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not run away, so they became victims,” said a representative of the Indonesian agency for the mitigation of BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he dragged cars, trees, houses, everything down the ground," explained Nugroho and added that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said that some people went to the trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the accident agency show destroyed buildings and shops, wrecked and destroyed bridges and mashed with water.
The stormy suns continued to search the coastal city on Saturday.
In the area of 2.4 million people, they felt a series of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in the Fridays is about 200 times greater than the power of the nuclear bomb in Hiroshima in the second world war.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of the long and narrow valley, is to increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “beneficial” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were trapped under the ruins of buildings, and he added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho explained that the victims and the damage may be greater on the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the area of Dongal, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
As Nugro said, the communications are completely interrupted and have no information from the Dongal area.
“More than 300,000 people live in the area,” said the statement of the Red Cross and added that staff and volunteers are moving away to affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it can get worse,” they said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms, since it did not inform the public that the tsunamis had affected Paul, but officials say the waves had arrived just in time of the issue of the warning.
On the amateur video published on social networks, it is heard that men on the top floor scream warnings people on the street in the approaching tsunamis.
In a few minutes, the water wall ran along the coast and took the buildings and cars with it.
At Reuters, they could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunamis have resulted in a failure of electricity, which has disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
The authorities report that the military has begun to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other basic necessities of life.
The airport was opened only to provide aid and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims in the Indonesian tsunami increased to over 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Doseb, the World Vision members of the Dongale organization arrived safely in Pala, where they were employed in the courtyard in front of their rooms, but on the way they saw numerous scenes of desertification.
“They told me they saw many destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with much experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
In accordance with the Indonesian Regulations, the overseas funding, stocks and assistance of personnel shall be authorised only if the accident is declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still treated as an accident at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'okay, this is a national accident', we can accept international aid, but there is no such status."
On the second night after a Friday earthquake and tsunami in Palu, the missing friends and relatives hesitate to hope that their loved ones are the closest miracles in sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped for two days and her mother's body was lying next to her.
Gendon Subandano, a coach of Indonesia's Naval Fall, trained two wrong sailors for Asian games that ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
The other, caught at Roa Roa Hotel, were his students by Mr. Mandagija's words.
“As an old man in the field of nuclear waste, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that in an hour when the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel passed through a community of sailors, he sent messages to whatsApp competitors in Palu, who attended the festival on the beach.
But his messages were marked only with one gray pencil instead of two blues.
‘I think this means that the messages were not delivered,’ he said.
Tatov stole USD 26.750 while filling the ATM in the center of Newport on the Levee
After reporting to the Newport police, the dads stole 26,750 USD from the security staff of Brink’s, who filled the ATM at the center of Newport on the Leeve, on Friday morning.
The car driver left the ATM in a fun complex and was preparing for the delivery of money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a public statement.
While he was employed, another man “approached to the staff security service Brink’s from the back” and stole the money bag for delivery.
After the report, the Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not indicate the exact number of people involved in the event.
All who have information about the identity of suspects should call the Newport police number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name in Ye
Raper Kanye West changed his name – in Ye.
The change was posted on Twitter on Saturday and wrote: "Betje with the official name Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has a title Yes for a while and he also used it for the title of his eight-year-old album, which he released in June.
The change comes just before his performance at Saturday Night Live, where he was supposed to present his new Yandhi album.
He will replace the singer Ariano grande, who has rejected the performance for ‘special reasons’, told the performer.
The word is a reduction in his current professional name, and West has already said that the word has religious significance for him.
“I think that “ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where “you” means “you”,” West said at the beginning of this year when speaking about the title of the album with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you and I'm all me.
Kanye, which means “one”, I have changed into Ye – this reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of everything we are."
Kanye is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed his desire for Love and Brother Love.
The former West co-worker, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with thought or without it and with large letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected Mexican President Andress Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed that he would never use military forces against civilians, just as the country nears the 50th anniversary of the violence against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza market that "he will never use forces to stifle the Mexican people."
At a time when left-wing student movements began to operate in Latin America, on the peaceful demonstrations on the market on October 2, 1968, 300 people were shot and killed.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans and students to provide monthly grants and open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities to educate young people drag on to criminal associations.
U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
Since China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the resources it spends on research in this area, says the investor and expert for the artistic intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come from the fact that various parts of the U.S. government have predicted the use of artificial intelligence, although the US does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan: their goal is to become the best in innovations in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Adjudication of the budget for artistic intelligence research would be a good start, given that all other countries are very much for the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The duplication of funding could double the possibility of the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence in the US, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month, was the founder of the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, a company president of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most visible intelligence companies, Face+.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University developed an art intelligence system that won the highest-ranking U.S. player Othello and later was executive director of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee said he was familiar with the previous American government technological competitions, such as the match in the robotics organized by the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and asked when he would find the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. must work hard to receive state support, Lee said.
“It’s not the Chinese who takes the best academics, but it’s the companies,” Lee explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been working best with the university in recent years to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the US strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that you should offer a green card automatically to people with an artificial intelligence doctor,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a development plan for the artificial intelligence of a new generation.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences is funding people in academic institutions, like the National Scientific Foundation and other government organizations are distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the US Ministry of Defence set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House has announced the establishment of a strong committee for artificial intelligence.
This month, the DARPA announced an investment in the AI Next initiative of $2 billion.
The National Scientific Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than USD 100 million per year in artistic intelligence research.
In the meantime, American legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for artificial intelligence, has not done anything for months.
Macedonians will decide at the referendum to change the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted on Sunday at the referendum to change their country's name to the 'North Macedonian Republic'. This would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which opposed their application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to their territory and has put a veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments concluded an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, but the boycott campaign expressed doubts that participation would be at least 50 percent, as much as it is necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum sheet was: 'Are you to join NATO and the EU by adopting an agreement with Greece?'
The sponsors of the referendum, including the President of the Zoran Zaev government, claim that this is a price worth paying to join bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that have emerged since the collapse of Yugoslavia.
I came to vote today for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote which will be decided.
The amendment of the name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission has notified that no irregularities have been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters gave their vote.
“I came to choose for my children, our city is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjos Tanevski, a favourite from the capital of Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško, gave their votes in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018 for a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country that would open the way for NATO and the European Union to join.
In front of Parliaments in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small oven and set up chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads raised, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Mediterranean integration."
The President of the Zaev Government says that NATO membership will make a strong investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his ballot.
He added that it would be a positive result of 'confirming our future'.
The survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday showed that the referendum would take place between 30 and 43% of voters, which is less than the required election participation.
The second survey conducted by Macedonian TV Telma showed that 57% of respondents would prefer Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would vote for them.
In order for the referendum to succeed, there must be a 50-percent vote plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious impact on the policy of the Western government, which took over the mandate last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has played the entire Briggton defense and victory
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defense at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester in England on Saturday in Manchester City with 2-0.
Aguere's baby in 65 minutes was looking ridiculously simple.
At the start of the action, the Argentine attacker accepted the surrender at the center of the game.
He ran between three Brighton's defensive players and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He played one of the defense players and was faster than the others at Brighton's prison.
Then he gave Sterling to his left.
With his first touch in the prison, the English attacker returned to Agueru, who with his right leg beat Brighton's doorman Mathew Ryan and sent the ball to the right side of the network.
“Aguero faces problems in his legs,” the journalist told the coach of City Pep Guardiola.
"We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he hit the goal at that moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave the blue son the initial advantage in the first English league.
The goal was reached in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton's half.
The ball on the left hand gave Leroy a nice hand to Sane.
The dream touched the ball several times, and then sent the ball to Sterling against the remote door.
The blue boy's attacker pushed the ball into the net just before she ran out of naked space.
The city will meet at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. in the Group of League champions.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies and ruin their title options.
The Nationals team came out of the finish line, so there's no special reason for a new attack.
But always the competitor Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he will be able to rise to metal crickets against the Colorado Rockies team. This will only happen if Rockies still have the opportunity to play in the final because in the Western League they have the advantage of the Los Angeles Dodgers team.
Rockies on Friday with a 5:2 win over the Nationals team provided at least the organizer's invitation, but they are still waiting for their first address in the division.
“Although we can’t get anything, at least we can play in the great air in front of a lot of people here in Denver and the opposite team will play at probably the highest level this year.
So why don't you want to compete?"
Nationals have not yet published the names of the first metal in a week, but in this case it will probably be metal Scherzer.
Scherzer, which will be so first metal 34 times, is Thursday as a burden player and would have had enough days of rest by Sunday.
Washington's right-wing winner collected 18 wins and 7 wins with an average of 2.53 and 300 hit-outs in 220 2/3 changes this season.
Trump at the meetings in West Virginia
The President directly addressed the situation regarding his election to the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican electoral participation in the interim elections.
"Everything we've done will be on the dice in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This will be one of the biggest – I really try to run a candidacy, so I fight for excellent candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump went on to say: "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats and it is happening now.
They are determined to take over the area again, using all possible resources.
They care about who they hurt, who they have to cope with to get power and control. This is what they want, power and control, but we will not give it to them."
According to his words, democracy is on the mission of 'responsibility and obstruction'.
“And you could see this in the last four days,” he said and labeled the Democrats as “serious, evil, low and false”.
A member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, was nominated as a representative of the community, and there was a loud rejection.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you published the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, no, wait, that was a really bad body speaker, the worst I've ever seen."
The labyrinth is no longer open to different views.
To those who express their opinion, she is impatient.
When Momentum's activist in my local party told me not to trust me, it was no surprise.
Finally, I am the last in a number of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party who are not interested in expressing my opinion.
My colleagues, Ambassador Joan Ryan, have happened the same way because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, it went on the proposal of a non-confidential about my non-compliance with Jeremy Corby.
Given the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
In a briefing on Friday's meeting of the Nottingham East Labour Party, we wrote that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In eight years, as a member of the parliament of the local laboratory party, Friday meetings were mostly exactly like that.
Today, the majority of the meetings do not use such a tone and the promise of a “more friendly and gentler” policy has been forgotten for a long time.
It is increasingly evident that different views in the labyrinth parties are not allowed and that each opinion assesses whether this is acceptable for the client’s management.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and my colleagues, whom I had previously thought to share similar political views, expected me to change my opinion and take a stand that I would never agree with – whether in the area of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak in public – and it is not important, in fact, what I say – they follow criticisms on social networks that call for a non-election, condemn the politics of the media and tell me that they should not be in a labyrinth.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I have more luck than some of my colleagues, because the comments I make are purely political.
I admire the expertise and determination of those colleagues who meet each day with the flood of sexist or racist complainants, but they are not allowed to be frightened.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this policy period is how the levels of abuse have become something quite common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that a laborer must promote a culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions and with any proposal of confidentiality or amendment of the rules for the choice of a party becomes more sensitive.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice to turn my head off and not be so loud, and I will be "all right" with me.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student – the reason for this was the greed of the Tatcher government, which has caused my elementary school to be literally destroyed – I have tried to become a local minister or minister for better public services for those who need them most.
I've never been hiding my political beliefs, including the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused because of my political position and the areas I did not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I do not understand their wishes after the waste of time and energy to discuss my commitment to the leader of the laboratory party at a time when the state is swimming against a brexit that will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my right message is not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters and voters, whether or not they are members of a labyrinth party: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threat of choice or political suitability will turn me away from doing the best interests of all of you.

38:17 Blessed is the man whom the Father honoureth, not the head the son of man.
Two well-known attempts have caused a few to fail, but there is no doubt that Ayr won the victory in this wonderful fun first-class game of the day.
Now they're at the top of the ladder and they're the only unencumbered team of ten.
In the end, the weight cut off their top defenses and better use of the opportunity and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason for satisfaction.
"In our advanced games we have endured many trials and we are still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "Happy Ayra teams, opportunities have taken advantage of better than we have."
Grant Anderson's mission in the 14 minutes that Frazier Climo turned, Ayr took the lead, but the Romanian carton for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who received it in the game with Warriors, meant a number of beats for Melrose and Jason Baggott was a forceless attempt.
Climo increased his leadership for Ayr at the time of the fall and then turned himself into a self-test for score 17:5 for Ayr at sea.
But Melrose started the second half and tried Patrick Anderson, who transformed Baggot, to reduce the remainder to five points.
It followed a long interruption due to the serious injury caused by Ruaridh Knott, who was taken to the carriages, and then Ayr progressed with the attempt of Stafford McDowall, who transformed Climo.
The provisional Captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received the Romanian cardboard and Melrose again took advantage of the game with the player more with an unreformed attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of the period of intense pressure.
But the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card due to the conflict with the Clim without the ball, MacPherson got hit.
Climo reached the point after Kyle Rowe shot David Armstrong's throne and sent Gregor Henry's wing player in the fifth attempt of the guests.
The star of the Still Game series starts a new career in hospitality
The star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is clearly presented in the hospitality, and is expected to become the director of the licensed company with restaurants.
A 56-year-old in a popular BBC series, also written for the script, plays Jack Jarvis together with a long-term partner in comedy Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that after the next nine seasons of the last season, Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official documentation, the Director of the company Arigingmorn Limited is.
The player did not want to comment on the stories, but the source for the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan want to join the "flowering hospitality" in Glasgow.
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings are surrounded by the blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicak to Amazon are covered with a slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to return it."
In northern Bolivia, memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody dispute due to natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive, as is the fluttering of the Pacific Ocean.
This hope may now be the greatest after decades, as Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice, which will receive it after five years of consultation on 1 October.
"Bolivia has a beginning, a spirit of unity and impartiality, and of course a positive spirit awaits the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Hague Court will decide in the province of Bolivia, which insists that, after decades of unrest, it must negotiate Bolivia's access to sovereign access to the sea.
Here Morales, the Bolivian charismatic native president, who is waiting next year for a controversial battle to be re-elected, has also high expectations about Monday's judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the Court will not decide on Bolivia’s arrival – and even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN headquarters in the Netherlands has not authorized Bolivia to allocate Chilean territory and will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after hearing the final arguments means that the case ‘was not complicated’,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the past four years, they haven't spoken in Bolivia, but they may have a lot to do with it.
"The current Bolivian government has used the question of access to the sea," Zárateev said.
Morale’s aggressive rhetoric has made it clear from the Chilean people’s best wishes, which may have remained.
Talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but then it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
The countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, the Bolivian representative of The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusually quick decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an exceptional opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "end of 139-year disagreements with each other", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular Latin American presidents – used the maritime issue as a political resistance.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to predict that we must overcome the past."
North Korea said nuclear disarmament would not happen if it couldn't trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never destroy their nuclear weapon first if they could not trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri had a speech at the United Nations General Assembly.
The United States has called for their promises to be fulfilled at a meeting between the leaders of the rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when US Minister Mike Pompeo was apparently before the relaunch of nuclear diplomacy, which was at a dead end, more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says that the United States is wrong if they think that the continuation of the sanctions and the contract of the Korean war's end will put the Koreans on their knees.
Washington is careful in approving the prediction without first taking decisive measures to disarm Pjonghang.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want another meeting.
But he is overcome by the general doubt that Pyongyang thinks seriously about the rejection of the weapon that the state sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare everything for another meeting of Kim and Trump.
In fashion magazines in Paris, discover the latest line of huge cover coming to shops with affordable brands near you
If you want to complete your collection covered or completely hidden from the sun, you do not need to search further.
The designer Valentino and Thom Browne discovered in their collections for spring and summer 2019 on fashion trails a collection of strange superstars that blinded the style in Parisian fashion week.
Very impractical coverage of this summer's Instagram, and the designers sent their spectacular creations to fashion trails.
Valentine's piece, which was most outstanding, was the hat in the beige color with wide edges decorated with feathers similar additions in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other too many fashion supplements included skulls with precious stones, magic hats and even pineapple – but your heads will not warm.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks – exactly the right time for the night of witches.
Many colourful masks have succulent lipsticks and are more similar masks to Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation was similar to a blower with a breath and glasses, and the other was seen as a grain with a degree of ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're lucky.
Modern knowledge predicts that the giant cover will come to a store near you.
Wide hats are closely followed by ‘La Bombi’, broken hat with 60-centimeter edges, among other things, were observed in Rihanni and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand for an extremely non-practical hat that flooded the social network sent another great creation – a broken beach bag, which was almost as big as a maneken in the baths it was wearing.
The bag of raffia in a burnt orange color, surrounded by rafia resins and with white leather gloves, was the central part of the La Riviera collection in Paris in spring/flight 2019.
The founder of the famous Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to arrive in the store for the following summer – because the designer made such a powerful impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many supplements.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is key to global citizens
Scottish independent schools enjoyed the titles of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a number of outstanding results on the exams that further enhance individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, you are represented by the Scottish Single Schools Council (SCIS), trying to provide the highest level of service for your students and their parents.
Self-employed schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, the chosen career path and the city they have as global citizens.
As the education sector, which can shape and implement the adapted school programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, the conversation will come to his mind.
But if you speak with a man in his mother tongue, words will come to his heart."
This is a good reminder that we must not rely solely on English when we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s results from recent studies show that the languages at the top of the ladder are at the highest levels of success in independent schools.
68 percent of students who have learned that language have achieved a good score.
The data collected in 74 schools in the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS) showed that 72 percent of students achieved a good grade in Mandarin and 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated as a selection item in the school plans of independent schools, and others are treated as objects in the fields of nature, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A study carried out by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014 showed that for reasons why employers are struggling to fill free jobs, 17 percent of us attribute a lack of language knowledge.
Therefore, language knowledge becomes increasingly urgent in preparing young people for their future career.
For future employment opportunities that require language skills, these skills are essential in the global world.
If someone learns another language, he has a great advantage in the future, regardless of the career path he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge.
A multilingual person who can agree directly with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage over competition.
The 2013 YouTube survey, covering more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, showed that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to speak, with French being the only language spoken by the two-thirds of respondents, that is 15 percent.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding adequate employment.
Schools in Scotland differ in the languages they teach.
Numerous schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that should be the most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, you will always be able to choose a number of languages taught by experts in this field in independent schools.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and arm children with the knowledge they need to succeed, regardless of what the future brings.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, so this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be treated as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It needs to be done well.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will be debuting in San Diego on Sunday in Lakers' dress.
For fans who are pleased with LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers team, waiting will soon end.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would play in the Sunday introductory match against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
He doesn't know how many minutes he'll play.
“More than one and less than 48” explained Walton on the official website of the Lakers team.
The director of the Lakers team Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six Lakers games before the season.
"At this stage, I don't need a race before the season," he said.
trumpet assembly in West Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today in Wheeling in West Virginia begins a series of meetings in his campaign.
This is the first of Trump's five planned meetings next week, including the formations in its countries, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his candidate for a free place in the Supreme Court is not yet confirmed, Trump wants to receive support for the upcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress after the November vote.
At what time will Trump's assembly in West Virginia and where on the Internet can he be seen?
The trumpet assembly in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 a.m. after East Time.
The trumpet collection in West Virginia can be viewed live online on the YouTube channel.
Trump will probably talk about candidates' hearings for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court this week, which has become tense due to allegations of sexual misconduct, which is why the confirmation in the Senate is expected to be postponed for one week in order to conduct an investigation by the FBI.
However, the primary objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans, who are awaiting important elections in November, to win a new start.
Therefore, in the campaign of President Trump, these five meetings were intended to "encourage volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"Observation at the Congress is so important for his programme that the president will travel in as many countries as possible during the hard season," Reuters told the representative of Trump's campaign, who did not want to be appointed.
Today’s meeting at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling would also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania after the report of West Virginia MetroNews, which would attract the interest of the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia again in the last month, in which he received more than 40 percent of the points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in public research.
"For Morrisey it is a bad sign that the president must come and "get him up" in public research," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, after the Reuters report.
Ryder's Cup 2018: U.S. team still wants to win and maintain hope before Sunday alone matches
After three foreign games, the two foursomes may have been what Ryder's castle needed this year.
There was nothing completely invented about sports, but players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So where did it go now?
“They have had six points of advantage, but now they have four, so this is probably a new start for us,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, since it leads by four points, and 12 more can be achieved.
But the Americans feel that they have wind in the sails, among other things, in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three points of four.
Speeth was killed from the initial strike to the greenery and gave a good example.
The crickets of happiness continued to become louder and led to a decisive blow when Thomas and he were left with two points of equality in the fourth game.
The hit that won them on the 15th of the hole has set them up with a similar scream, such as to let you know that we believe that the American team has more possibilities.
"You just have to look for your inner power and focus on your game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes to slaves.
The only players with more points than Speeth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable story of Ryder's kiss.
An unusual but charming two of Europe has won four points out of four and are infallible.
The two "Mollwood" were the only one who didn't hit the bug on Saturday afternoon, but the buggers also avoided on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and at the last nine holes on Friday mornings.
Such a game and the way in which the energy flows between them and the deaf community obviously confirms the fact that the players who are going to win the game on Sunday are the ones who will have to win it, and no other player could better seal any European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun falls over the Le Golf National.
And if you can, you can do both in different holes at the same time.
But talking about the European Celebration would be too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergia Garcio, a morning hero in the game with four balls, who was in a couple with Alex Noren.
Because of the buggy and the two double buggers in the first nine holes, Spain and Sweden fell into a crisis from which they could not find a way out.
But on Saturday, the players won't have any help.
Games with four balls and doubles of two are exceptionally interesting to monitor closely because of communication between couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way in which the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has so far played better than the team and has a great advantage before the last day, but the two of them have shown that the US team also has a wish for victory, which some, especially on the American side, have questioned.
Europe leads 10:6 before Ryder's last day
Europe goes on the last day of Ryder's kiss with a good advantage after the four-balls and two-two-two-ball games are played on Saturday, with 10:6 against the United States.
The excellent couple made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari gave all of himself and with two victories over Tiger Woods and at Le Golf National played four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to win the trophy that she lost in Hazeltin two years ago, had in the morning games four balls of power over the American team that was wrong, and said in a series of 3:1.
The U.S. team was better able to fight in the two doubles, where they won two games, but the rest could not be rewarded.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual fights if they want to keep a trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newspaper to win four consecutive points, while with Molinary (a couple called Molliwood) after a sensational weekend only the second pair to win four points in its first four games in Ryder's history.
After winning over Woods and Patrick Reed in the game with four balls, they again proved to be more convincing to beat the spent Woods and American journalist Bryson Dechambeau with 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliantness at the moment, but lost 19 of the 29 games in the four ball and two two games, of which seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the morning game with the four balls, returned for the two doubles and in a couple with Henrik Stenson with 2 and 1 beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who are ranked on the first and third world ladders.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, not everything went according to the plans of the European team.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new criterion for the Americans on Saturday.
With 2 and 1, they firmly won against Spanish Jon Rahmu and Ian Poulter in the game with four balls and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in two, losing the first two holes.
Only once in Ryder's history did the team return after the remaining four points in front of the single battles, although Fury's team only needs equality to maintain the trophy.
But after two days in the second place, the Sunday attack may seem too much to attack.
North Korea: "Without confidence we will not be isolated"
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continued implementation of sanctions would cause increasing mistrust in the United States of America and that North Korea would certainly not unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapon.
At the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this World Authority, Ri Jong Ho said that North Korea had over the past year adopted a number of 'significant measures in good will', such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, substantiating nuclear testing sites and promising that they would not expand nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not see a corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not be convinced of state security and under such conditions we will never be the first to become unilaterally disarmed."
While Ri reiterated the well-known claims made by North Korea regarding Washington's resistance to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking progressive measures, his statement was important because it did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pjongang had done in the past.
Ri made a joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current president of the United States and North Korean leaders, which took place on 12 June in Singapore. Kim then pledged to strive for "the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised North Korea security assurance.
North Korea wants the official conclusion of the Korean war, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States said that Pjongang must first renounce nuclear weapons.
Washington also did not allow the call to release the strict international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
"The US insists that we must first be nuclearly disarmed, and step up the pressure with sanctions to achieve its objectives by force, and even object to the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
“In thinking that sanctions could put us on our knees, it is an unrealistic hope for people who don’t know us at all.
It is a challenge, however, to make further implementation of sanctions exacerbate our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kimo and Trump, which the US President presented to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kimo and South Korean President Mun Jae Inom, which took place in the past five months, and added: "If the problems of nuclear disarmament were to be discussed with South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not be agreed upon at such a dead point."
Nevertheless, the tone of Rije's speech was quite different from that of the year when the United Nations General Assembly said that the attack on the North Korean missile-related coastal part of the United Nations was inevitable, after "Mrs. Evil President" Trump referred to the "ruling man" on the suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim and his courage in taking disarmament measures at the United Nations meeting, but said that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should remain valid until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that this was not a time frame for this, and he said: "The duration may be two years, three years or five months – it does not matter."
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongang for the measures taken.
Nevertheless, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be firmly continued without exception until we recognise the complete, final and verifiable state of nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously accepted additional sanctions for North Korea in order to prevent the financing of North Korean nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeii and Río met at the United Nations General Assembly and later said that Pjongang would visit again next month for preparations at the second summit.
Pompey visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When he left Pjongang in July, he said that he had made progress, and North Korea had criticised him in a few hours, if his demands were "gangster".
At the meeting with Muna this month, North Korea committed itself to the support of the missile test station and the nuclear test infrastructure if the United States adopts "appropriate measures".
It should be said to Kim that the ‘appropriate measures’ mean the security assurances that Trump promised in Singapore and the measures to normalise relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard University attend a course that teaches them how to take enough time to rest
The aim of the new Harvard University this year is to teach all pre-graduate students how to get more sleep. They want to fight against the growing masquerade culture of “celenonic” learning, where the powers are mixed with caffeine.
The university professor found that students of the best universities in the world often do not know the basis for caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham Women's Hospital, formed a course of his first kind in the United States.
In order to implement such a course, he decided after his lecture on the impact of the lack of sleep on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl approached him and said, "Why do I know this just now that I'm in my last year?"
She said no one else told her how important a sleeper was, and for The Daily Telegraph, the professor said it surprised him.
The course that is first held this year is about the key importance of good sleep habits for study and sports success as well as for improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, says they decided to do so when they found that during the week, students had a significant lack of sleep.
The single course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, the picture is the door of the student's home, where students can click coffee cups, curtains, sports blankets and books to get information about the effect of caffeine and light, the effect of lack of sleep on sports success and the importance of sleep routines.
In the second section, participants find that long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of cardiac arrest, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the student village with interactive icons encourages the participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that the behaviour of students will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to get acquainted with these facts, just as they have the right to know how their health affects smoking cigarettes," adds Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride in "lifelong learning" is still present. He adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students, as a result of lack of sleep, are growing problems.
Professor Czeisler says that a sufficient amount of quality sleep should be “covered weapons” for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety. This can also prevent the gain of weight – the brains, because of the lack of sleep, are becoming hungry and the students are constantly hungry.
A 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology Raymond So helped Professor Cheisler to form a course. Last year, he attended one of the professors' lectures at Harvard.
He says the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct courses throughout the student village.
It hopes that in the next phase, the undergraduate students will be able to request the completion of a similar study programme before entering the competition institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students continue to wake up to sleep as well as to wake up. He also wants to remind them of the harmful effects of the “modern light” that electronic displays and LED lighting can cause the imbalance of the circus rhythm, which makes it difficult to sleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga mit zadekom subtopil upe Gerarrdo's team
Rangers once again defeated in guests: Dolly Menga in Livingstone convicted Steven Gerrard of defeating 1 : 0.
The team from Ibrox hunted her first guest victory after the February victory at St. Johnstone Stadium with 4 : 1, but Gary Holt's team beat her second defeat in 18 matches, since she was at the head of the Gerrard team, leaving his team behind 8 points.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the chosen species of Rangers did not give the impression that he wanted to equalize.
The Rangers fell into a common place, and Livingstone progressed into a third place, but with the difference of heads, the Hibernian team remained.
The weight of Rangers was not over with this. Calum Spence, a foreign judge, suffered a head injury when, after reporting to him, he flew an object from the city of fans of the guest team.
Gerrard, in a crew that beat Ayr without any trouble and classified himself as a semifinal Betfred Cup, made eight changes.
On the other hand, Holt was holding the audited unit of Livingstone, which had taken over the hearts team's point a week earlier, and was no doubt excited about how his affected team had effectively neutralized all the guests' attempts.
The Rangers had a higher possession of the ball, but Livingstone made better use of it.
The first chance came two minutes after Menga first found Scott Pittman, and then went to the goal of Allan McGregor, but he was linked to the implementation inaccurate and missed the opportunity.
Long free shot Keaghan Jacobs then reached Captain Craig Halket, but the ball then his defense assistant Alan Lithgow failed to get into the goal.
In the last third, Rangers took control, but the game said more hope than the actual wish after the victory.
Alfredo Morelos was pretty sure that after the race with Steven Lawless after 15 minutes of the match, he had to get a criminal shot, but Judge Steven Thomson had thrown the Colombians into a car.
In the first half of the year, Rangser managed to set up only two shots on the goal, but he did not shoot with the head sent against the goal by Lassana Coulibally, nor did Ovie Ejarija's ball, nor did it pose any danger to the doorman Liam Kelly.
Livingstone’s initial goal in 34 minutes may have surprised everything, but it has already been fully deserved because of its endurance.
Ransom has not been able to complete another Jacobs' sequel for a long time.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher brought the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Mengi to deliver for a simple conclusion of the attack.
Gerrard took action and, during Coulibaly's vacation, replaced Ryan Kent's wing player, who immediately showed up with Morelos, but Kelly effectively pulled out his lines and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in its role and forced guests into its game, with Lithgov and Halkett taking care of several subjects before the goal.
Holt's team could have increased the leadership by the end of the game, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs and then Lithgov was out of line.
At the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given the opportunity for a criminal shot after contact with Jacob, but Judge Thomson did not admit it.
Almanah: Geiger's Designer
We present a side from the Almaty of our Sunday editions: September 30, 1882, so today more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who later became a world-famous physicist, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed the method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, this invention was the basis for the development of a device called Geiger's shield.
This became a stable in the scientific world, and it also got its place in pop culture, such as in the movie “Bells of Coronado” in 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's shield. It's used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect on atoms of radioactive activity in materials.’
Evans: "Madunca, but now they're really going to cry!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
Imagination with his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can be learned by the immune system to identify attackable cells
A new cancer vaccine can be learned by the immune system to identify and destroy attack cells
The vaccine in the treatment teaches the immune system to recognise the attackable cells
This method includes the acquisition of immune cells in patients who have subsequently been modified in the laboratory
Thereafter, ‘see’ protein, which is characterised by many forms of cancer, may be returned to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received the vaccine that the immune system learns to recognise attack cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes the acquisition of immune cells of patients that are modified in the laboratory so that they can “see” HER2 protein, which is significant for many forms of cancer, and then inject again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute for Cancer Research in Bethesda in Maryland said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several different types of cancers”, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and fat intestines.
A similar approach to the acquisition of immune cells in patients who are “taught to target cell cancer” has also worked in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye West made a protruding point on the SNL with a letter from MAGA on the drop.
The community was not thrilled.
Kanye West was excited at the Saturday Night Live show studio at a strange point, during which he expressed his support for US President Donald Trump, and also said that 2020 would compete for the president's chair.
After the third song of his performance, called "Ghost Town", during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Make America Great Again", West began with an attack on the Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
“It often happens that I talk to a white person and he says to me, ‘How can you like Trump, because he’s a racist?’
"Well, if I were to worry about racism, I should have moved from America a long time ago," he says.
This time the SNL performance began with a parody with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood player was humiliated by Bretta Kavanaugh in front of the Justice Commission in a Senate accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
The video of the West Monologue was not screened, but it was uploaded to a social network by comical Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock was going to make it out of West.
West also complained to the community that he had some problems during the war because of writing on the drops.
"They've got me behind the suit.
I was told not to go to or with that kapo.
I've been seconded!
But they say I'm lost," said Washington Examiner's report.
West continued: 'Do you want to see the lost scene?' and added that you must find 'Superman's border, because that means that no one can point to me. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love."
His comments were made at least twice by the community and the members of the SNL team were obviously upset, and someone else told Vanity: “There was a death in the study.”
The West recently invited a goat exchange for Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
The West has caused a lot of surprises already with the video post for the song "I Love It", where he wore the costume of the Perrier mineral water bottle.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, who tweeted: "One of the bravest souls: Thank you for being UPRL RAJI."
But the leader of Karen Hunter's talk show insisted that West is simply "what it is, and it's totally fine.
However, I will not reward anyone (with the purchase of his music, the clothing or the support of his 'artivity') who, in my opinion, welcomes and spreads ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he changed his name and will then be “a being, formally known as Kanye West. Now I’m YE.”
He's not the first musician to decide to change his name. He's already done this to Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His roommate Snoop Dogg was once called Snoop Lion, but we can't forget another musical legend: the Prince changed his name into a symbol, and then he was an Artist, once known as the Prince.
A man charged with attempted murder because of the arrest of a person at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after he was stabbed by a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police say an event happened in Ballyhackamore.
The accused must be brought before the Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the public prosecutor.
The star of the game of the throne, Kit Harington, fiercely attacked the toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known after his match celebration in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval fantasy series of thrones.
A 31-year-old player who strongly condemned the stereotype of a machistic hero says that due to the appearance of such applications on screen young boys, they often feel that they can earn respect only with perseverance.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture that in his opinion something went wrong, and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood during the #JazAldi period.
A player who recently married a 31-year-old soloist from the Rose Leslie Prestoll, admitted to having strong convictions about this topic.
“I’m particularly seriously wondering where we’ve made a mistake when it comes to manhood,” he said.
“What did we teach men during our upbringing about the problems we now face?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing the toxicity of men due to the display of very powerful characters.
He continued: “What is born again and what is taught?
What are we taught on television and on the streets to make young boys feel that they have to choose the exact amount of manhood?
I think it's one of the important issues of our time, how can we change it?
Because apparently there was something wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also said that after the end of the series of the following summer he would not participate in the recording of any preview or continuation of the Game of thrones, because he had “completed with battles and horses”.
Kit will play in the main role of the new True West Sam Shepard show, which is the story of the film producer and his brother rapper.
The player recently found out that the best thing that happened to play the throne was that he met his wife Rose on the tape.
"Because of this series, I met my wife, so she gave me my future family and life from here on," he said.
Rose played the Ygritte, the love choice of Kitt's character Jon Snow in a fantasy series, awarded with Emmy.
The couple were married in June 2018 at the possession of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: 14% of new cases are reported from China
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say there are more than 820,000 people in the country.
Only around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been transmitted with sexual intercourse, which is a change compared to the past.
In some parts of China, HIV has usually spread rapidly due to the transfusion of infected blood.
However, according to Chinese health officials, the number of people infected with HIV in the province of Junan has decreased by almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS is still increasing annually in China for 100,000 people.
In the Chinese community, the transmission of the HIV virus with sex is a very serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very prevalent.
As conservative values still apply in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men are eventually married to women.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in such situations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised general access to medicines for the treatment of HIV as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that the staff issued data on Republican senators, condemning “hazardous lies” and “theorie of conspiracy”
On Saturday, US Congresswoman Maxine Waters dismissed the charge that a member of her staff published information about three American Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
The Los Angeles democracy has insisted that these accusations come from individuals and websites on the right.
"Failure, lies, and more unresolved lies," Waters wrote in a statement on Twitter.
The published information is based on domestic addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Hatcha from Utah.
This information appeared online on Thursday, which was published by an unknown person with Capitol Hill, during the senate's meeting on charges of sexual assault against the Supreme Judge, Bretta Kanaugh.
Information was obtained following the conclusion of the three senators hearing from Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicate that it is possible to identify through IP the source of the publication to be associated with the office Senator Waters and to conclude that the information has been published by some of the staff, reports Hill.
“These unsubstantiated charges are absolutely wrong and pure lies”, Watersov continues.
‘My employees whose identity, personal data and security are threatened by these false charges are not at all responsible for the termination of this data.
These unwarranted accusations are completely false and pure lies.’
Senator Waters' statement quickly ran into criticism online, including by former White House representative Aria Flescher.
“From this denial of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This may mean that it is not from the right test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something he hasn't done, he can't show his anger.
He can't resist.
And he must not doubt the motive of the accused.
You must remain calm.’
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the fourth hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is moving to the town of Waters in the interim elections, was on Twitter.
"If that's true, it's serious," he said.
Watersova stated in his statement that her cabinet informed "the relevant institutions and prosecution authorities regarding these false charges.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be disclosed”, she continued, “and that they will be responsible for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to all of them.”
Johnny English again in action - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
Looking for clues on Brexit in any new British film has already become traditional, and is also applicable to the recovery of Johnny English action comedy, which came into force for the first time in 2003 with Johnny English and continued in 2011 with Johnny English 2.
Will the fun satire about how we're done be a new export opportunity for us?
The uncompetent Johnny English, with his eyelids and unusual grimas, gets permission to remix the strips; already his name indicates that it is a comic character created for a cinematographic audience in non-English speaking areas.
It is an ingenious secret agent who, despite his bizarre moves, contains a part of Clouseau, Mr. Beana's canal and the smallness of the one who contributed to the last note of the Chariots of Fire at the ceremony at the opening of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
It is also based on the travel and international mystery network that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ad, leaving behind a real chaos.
One or two pleasant moments are presented in the latest film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, wore medieval armor, and the rotor lists were short on his helmet.
Atkinson's comedy gift is clearly displayed, but humor seems a few mild and unnecessary, especially because ‘real’ films such as 007 or Mission are now impossible without bad news.
It seems that humour is intended for children and not for adults, so for me to deny the adventures of Johnny English are not as innovative and targeted as Atkinson does not jump into the role of Mr Bean.
The constant theme is now obvious that Britain is in serious trouble.
The web hacker infiltrated the network of British most secret agents and revealed the identity of all British agents, causing major problems to the competent agent, which Kevin Eldon represents in a remarkable small role.
This is the point of a break for the premier, a pitiful figure that has already experienced a break because of political unlovedness: Emma Thompson did indeed try to play the role of the alleged Teresa May, but there is nothing in the scenario that could help.
The intelligence service informs her that all active spies are exposed, so she must decide for one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a prestigious school who teaches informally how to operate undercover: this is where the writers have won, because English is performing some kind of spy 'academia rock'.
English is being taken to Whitehall to an emergency meeting where he meets a long-term employee named Bough, who plays Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the commander of the submarine, a stereotype sports enthusiast, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is just a little lost.
Thus Batman and Robin are prepared to create more problems on behalf of the secret service of her Highness, and meet the fatal Ophelio Bulletin, played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the premiere is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: this is the evil Jason Volt playing Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their departure: dressed in a fan fueled fire in a French restaurant, create chaos when it predominates on the roof of Volt's yacht, and when English tries to use glasses for apparent reality in order to get to know the interior of Volt's house, he manages to create general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the sympathy and energy, it mentions the children's film.
Very average.
Like in other movies, Johnny English, I can't help myself here, and I don't think: is the British movie Atkinson able to play a role that actually justifies his talent?
Laborists deny that British are planning a four-day work week, which would pay for a five-day work week.
Jeremiah Corby's labor party is thinking about a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive a five-day payment.
The company's leading party wants the savings created by companies due to the revolution of artificial intelligence to flow to workers and provide them with an additional day off.
So the employees would enjoy a three-day weekend at the same high pay.
Vires say that the idea corresponds to the economic plan of the party and to the plan for the state to be placed on the side of the workers.
The unions support the transition to a four-day work week, as this is a way for workers to take advantage of the benefits of the changing economy.
A source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: 'The policy review should be published before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but the four-day worker is the goal that we will strive to achieve by the customer's approach to balancing the economy in favour of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party supported its four-day work week in its campaign in the 2017 general elections.
This objective is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The representative of the Labour Party said: "The four-day work week is not the party's policy and the party does not think about it."
The Chancellor in the shadow of John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to use the power of the 'respective Director' and the 'recipient' in municipal companies.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that the current stakeholders in the water companies may not be able to recover the full share again, as the laboratory party could impose ‘debts’ on the grounds of alleged guilt.
He also confirmed plans to involve workers in the administrative committees and to introduce the Own-Inclusion Funds, which would transfer 10% of the share in private enterprises to employees who would thus receive annual dividends up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, discussed in the “60 minutes” series whether their opinion could change the investigation by the FBI of Kavanaugh.
The investigation of the charges against Judge Bretta Kavanaugh of the FBI has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of any Republican senator could convince the judge that he would withdraw his support.
In an interview held on Sunday, the author of the “60 minutes” edition of the Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could find out anything that would change her opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than a South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
»I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh before the hearing began
When I called him when this charge came up, I asked him, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, unrestricted, without doubt.”
Graham's voice seems to be stuck in a rock.
"I have created my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would need a very convincing reason for his change," he said.
“I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I do know that Brett definitely did,” added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those names could confirm it.
The case is 36 years old.
I do not see any new changes."
What is the Festival of Global Citizens (Global Citizen Festival) and whether or not it has contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual musical event involving a truly extraordinary type of star and having the same extraordinary mission: to eliminate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will take place this week, will be attended by dozens of people. It will be attended by a large trail of the Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to stimulate interest in the real purpose of the event, i.e. the removal of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Citizens' Project, an international provocative group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free event ticket (except if you are prepared to pay for the VIP ticket), participants had to perform a series of tasks or “acts” such as volunteering, letter to the world leader, telephone call or any other meaningful way of raising awareness of their goal of poverty eradication.
But how successful is the movement of the Global Citizen, which has remained for 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them to demand action, or is this just another example of so-called 'clitivism' – creating a belief that people actually have a significant impact on the relationship with the signature of a online petition or the transmission of the debt?
The Global Citizen survey suggests that more than 19 million 'actions' of its supporters should be recorded in the effort to achieve a variety of objectives since 2011.
It says that these actions have helped global leaders to adopt commitments and policies worth more than USD 37 billion, which is expected to affect lives by 2030.
In 2018, the group indicated that the fruit of its 390 commitments and messages, which had already been paid or collected at least USD 10 billion, were expected to bear fruit.
The group estimates that so far, funds have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, the partnership of investors and decision-makers committed to "help children realize their full potential", which Rwanda promised 35 million USD to help eliminate nutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the Global Citizens.
“With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can talk about the social guilt of nutrition in the historical archives,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Moč Food Partnership in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the government, following more than 5,000 actions, which the United Kingdom called for improving the nutrition of mothers and children, announced that it would co-finance the Food Force project, which would reach 5 million women and children with food measures.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, "Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?",
the movement Global citizen replied: “This will be a long and hard path – sometimes we will fall and we will be defeated.
But like a great movement for civil rights and the fight against apartheid in front of us, we will also succeed, as we are stronger together.
Among some performers that will take place at this event in New York, are Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae. The event will lead Deborah-Lee Furness in Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy for the "block" of Russian exports of energy – the US Home Ministry
The American Interior Minister Ryan Zinke would have told Washington Examiner that Washington could use the Navy “if necessary” to prevent the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East.
Zinke said Russian intervention in Syria (to be warned that the government would be invited) is an excuse for investigating new energy markets.
"I believe that there is a reason for their presence in the Middle East for wanting to market energy, as they are in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," I would say.
According to the official, there are ways and means of dealing with this.
"The United States can do this. The Navy ensures that our maritime routes are open and blocked as necessary, preventing Russian energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event hosted by the Energy Consumer Union, a non-profit group called "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, warning that it was actually the same.
"As regards Iran and Russia, the economic potential is more or less the impact on fuel and their replacement," said Russia, marking as "a pony who knows one trick" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
Statements were made at a time when Trump's administration is trying to increase its exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, where it is intended to exacerbate Russia, which is a much cheaper choice for European consumers.
For this purpose, the government officials of Trump, including the US President, Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany that it would give up the "unacceptable" gas pipeline project North Stream 2, which is expected to be Moscow's "sateller" after Trump Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline is worth USD 11 billion, which is intended to double the existing gas capacity by 110 billion cubic metres, except for the economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that this is an unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we have the same view that energy should not be a tool for implementing pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
Germany rejected the US position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Organisation, the German Industry Association (BDI), has called for the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"Interfering a third country into our energy supply is a great problem for me," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Union (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "exactly study" his candidacy for the US President's 2020 election, says the Massachusetts Senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts, said on Saturday that she would "examine her candidacy for the US President after the mid-term elections".
In the city house in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would think about the candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, as a woman's leader requires," The Hill reported.
"After 6 November, I will study my candidacy for the President in detail."
Warren's meeting in the city house was built by President Donald Trump, as "this country should lead in the wrong direction."
“What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, I’m worried about,” she said.
Warren Trump and the candidate for the President of the Brett Kavanaugh High Court have been openly criticised on several occasions.
In a statement published on Friday, Warren said, "Of course before the elections we need an FBI investigation."
The poll published on Thursday showed that most of its own voters believe that Warren should not compete for the presidency in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Centre, a senator should not run for the president, eight-hundred percent of the "probably" voters from Massachusetts.
Twenty-three percent would support her candidacy.
The poll showed that there was more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% of respondents being supported and 48% being opposed.
Other high-level democracies that would be considered as candidates for the 2020 elections are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Poor after the report of the Associated Press agency, he said he would decide by January.
Sarah Palin mentioned a post-traumatic stress disorder in support of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, survived a year in Iraq after joining the army.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of family violence
“When my own son ceases, which he experiences after his return, he connects me with other families that are dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and certain extent of the injury our soldiers are returning with,” he told the community at a meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palinova marked his son's arrest as an "isle in the salon" and said that her son and other military veterans were returning a few changed, stiff, wondering where respect for what the Soviets and the airmen and all the other members of the army were giving to the State."
The track Palina was arrested on Monday in Wasilla in Alaska and accused him of violence in the family with assault on women, the prevention of family violence and the possession of weapons in the guilty state, said Dan Bennett, a police station representative in Wasilla.
18 States and the Colombian Districts Support the Withdrawal of New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian District support the legal rejection of a new American policy that denies the right to asylum to victims who flee from violence or domestic violence.
The NBC News agency reported that representatives from 18 countries and the area mentioned had filed a trial on Friday to support the legal opposition.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, filed by the American Association for Civil Liberties v. Federal Policy, has not been published.
She said that her partner and "his violent sons, members of the crowd" abused her, but on 20 July the US authorities rejected her request for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
The federal prosecutors who support Grace are Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which many asylum applications come to the United States, described as countries that constantly deal with problems of domestic violence and violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy in 2014 annulled the decision of the Committee on Immigrant Calls, which was open to innocent immigrants fleeing violence in the family, to allow the application for asylum.
The State Prosecutor of the District of Columbia, General Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "respects the decade of state, federal and international law."
‘National law requires all asylum requirements to be assessed on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the application, while such a prohibition violates this principle,’ states the request submitted to the court.
Public prosecutors further claimed that a policy that denied immigrants the right to entry would harm the US economy, as it was likely that they would become entrepreneurs and that they would "provide the necessary labour force".
The Judge General of State Jeff Sessions decided that in June they should no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing from domestic violence and violence.
“Assil is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear associated with race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in their policy publication on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to remove all the problems, even the serious problems people face every day throughout the world.
The number of victims in Palu has doubled, but desperate rescue attempts are taking place to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“The feeling is very tense,” said a 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma when she comforted her hot boy at the evacuation centre in a broken town of Pala.
"Savers continually import bodies.
It lacks clean water.’
It seemed to be locals, returning to ruined homes that had been swept through the crowded things and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hundreds of hospitals destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 were overloaded.
Some injured, including Two Haris, who suffered back and shoulder injury, rest outside of the Palu hospital, where patients were treated on a free basis because of persistent severe excruciating suns.
When he recalled a violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was raised by his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
"There was no time to get rid of it.
I think I was forced against the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press agency. He added that he was with his family in town for the wedding.
"I heard a woman calling for help and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of “delegating” with “propaganda ads”
One week after the publication of the four - page announcement of the official Chinese magazine in the US daily, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US Ambassador in China Beijing accused US press abuses to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last week mentioned the paid supplement of an official of China Daily in Des Moines Register – the most sold magazine in the state of Iowa, after China accused interference in the US Congress elections on 6 November, which China denied.
The Reuters Agency reported that US officials in Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in US federal elections, described as a new phase in the ever-increasing effort of Washington to pressure China.
Although the publication of advertisements to promote trade is common for foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an increasingly intense trade war in which they exchange shocks by introducing customs duties on imported products.
The Chinese refund rates at the beginning of the trade war were intended to harm exporters in the Federal States, such as Iowa, which are supported by Trump’s Republican Party, by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to the Chinese and former government of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said that Beijing had been affected by American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of Officer Des Moines Register, "now this oppression doubles by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press".
“In expanding the propaganda, the Chinese government used the American tradition of free speech and free press to publish a paid ad in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, you will see only a few other opinions and no real reflections of the diversity of opinions that Chinese citizens have about the worrying Chinese economic path, since the municipality is strictly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese magazines rejected an offer for publication” of his article, although he did not mention which.
Republicans lose voters before mid-elections with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
Analysts point out that the support of many of the most important republics supporting and defending the candidate for the Bretta Kavanaugh Supreme Court, despite several charges of sexual assault, will be known for the upcoming interim elections with the loss of voters.
The feelings here are extremely high, but most Republicans have already said they want to proceed with the vote.
This cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of polythology at Maxwell University College in Siracuzah for an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's pressure to investigate the FBI would last be enough to calm the angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow and also November no," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national representative of the progress group MoveOn, on Friday, after Officer Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors sang “November is coming!” when they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate, when the Republicans who oversee the judicial committee decided to continue their support for the Kavanaugh appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the news portal Mic reported.
"Democrat inspiration and motivation will go beyond all borders," the portal reporters told Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"People say they're strong now, and that's what it holds.
But it could be even stronger, especially among unrestricted voters in suburban and smaller voters aged 18 to 29 who do not like the President, but do not often.”
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of the sexual assault of the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts said that further Republican support could have a negative impact.
“This has become a major confusion for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Council, following the NBC News report earlier last week.
“It is not only the vote of the Council or the final vote or the Kavanaugh vote; it is also the way the Republicans are engaged in this and how they dealt with Fordovo,” said Guy Cecil, director of the Group of Priorities USA, for the television channel, who supports the Democrats in the elections.
But the Americans seem to be a few divided during this, or more likely to believe the story of Ford or Kavanaugh, with a few more supporting the latter.
The new YouTube poll says that 41 percent of respondents are sure whether they believe in Ford's story, and 35 percent said they are sure or most faithful to Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh was probably lying to them during the story, and only 30 percent said so about Ford.
Following the pressure of FBA, Flakea is currently investigating the allegations made by Fordova, and at least one of them, Deborah Ramirez, reported by The Guardian.
Ford's last week before the Senate's court-martial told her that Kavanaugh, when he was 17 years old, attacked her in a guilty state.
Ramirez claims that she was shown sex when they were together at the party during their study at Yale University in 1980.
The inventor of the world’s web plans to start a new internet to deal with Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, an inventor of the world's web, opens up a start-up company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners' open-ended Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose of Inrupt was "to rule the world".
"We have decided to do this now," he said about the new company.
"Go for a historical moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to enable users to create a ‘personal storage storage’ or POD
This may include information about contacts, mailing lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is similar as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser and at the same time.
The specificity of the personal data storage repository is that the user can fully determine who can access the information.
This company is called "personal data-refunding".
Executive Director John Bruce says the company's idea is to combine resources, processes and appropriate skills that will allow the Solid platform to be accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers for work on the project and the community of volunteer programmers.
Already this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group "with Facebook and Google are not talking about whether they could introduce a complete change that could eliminate all their business models overnight."
"We don't ask for permission."
In a Saturday publication on the Media Portal, Berners-Lee wrote that the purpose of Inrupt was "to ensure commercial energy and the ecosystem for the protection of the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee was an Internet transformer with the establishment of a World Wide Web Consortium consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will also remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Institute of Open Data.
"As far as the next time I'm online, I'm extremely optimistic," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: A celebration of the Victorian Cross of World War I
In the home city for 100 years, they celebrate the division of the Victorian cross to the only minister of the English Church who won it as a fighter in the first world war.
The Honourable Lieutenant Bernard Vann deserved recognition on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, though, he was shot by a gunman, so he never learned that he had been given this highest British military honor.
On Saturday at the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two Colonel's grandson discovered a monumental stone.
One of the lawyers, Michael Vann, said that it was “extremely symbolic” that they discovered the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s act, with which he earned his distinction.
Following the report of officer London Gazette, Lieutenant Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint Quintina "to cross a very dense fog and under the powerful fire of a battlefield and machinery."
Later, he planned against the shooting line and led the line with the "most hero" and then attacked the machine and beat three members of the squad.
Colonel Vanna shot a German sharpsman on 4 October 2018 – only a good month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of an old father were “something I know and could never achieve, so teach me humility.”
With Dr. James Vanna's brother, they put the wedding ring on the parade led by the honor of Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be able to participate in this paradise" and "that the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that many people will express."
Incentives to mixed martial arts spent all night watching Bellator 206. Instead, they were part of Puise Pepe.
Imagine: You spent all night praying to watch the completely sold Bellator 206, and then you cannot see the main event.
The event in San Jose included 13 matches, including six on the main park, and it was carried alive in the United Kingdom on the fifth channel.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a meeting, the viewers in the United Kingdom found that the transmission had been replaced by the performance of the drawing by Pujs Pepa.
Marsikdo was not very excited because he stayed up until morning just because of the fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described a child’s picture as “a kind of painful joke”.
“In accordance with the government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a child programme,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of Bellator for marketing and communication when asked about the transfer.
"Pepa Possa.
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they were trying to adjust the schedule so that future audiences in the United Kingdom would also be involved.
"When I think about replaying, I think we could handle it," Coker said.
“Then there is six o’clock in the morning Sunday and we will not be able to arrange it until Sunday after our time or Monday after theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, many messages were exchanged at the time of the switch and not all were friendly.
We tried to arrange the matter; we thought it was just a technical mistake.
However, there was a real reason for the government regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen again next time.
Instead of the six, we will have five fights — as usual — and we tried to offer fans more than we expected and saved ourselves.
It is a very ungrateful situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "bad" about sex.
The Olympic fan Tom Daley said that because of his sexual orientation, he felt inferior to anyone — but gave him a motivation for success.
The 24-year-old said that he was aware of “not every single one of them” when he entered high school.
Speaking in the first edition of Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4 radio station, he said he spoke about the rights of gays to give other "hope".
He also said that when he became a parent, he had reduced his desire to win the Olympics.
The regular conductor, Kirsty Young, has been absent for several months because of her illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outsider in Laverne's first performance, said he felt “less worth” than everyone else, because “it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls.”
He said: "To this day, these feelings of inworthiness and diversity are a real thing that gives me the strength and endurance to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was “something” and said that he would not disappoint anyone who finally realized his direction.
Twice the bronze Olympic competitor became an influential advocate of LGBT law and appeared twice this year at the National Community Games in Australia in order to call on countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy, that he could speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time World Cup winner said he was a novelist with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, with whom he met in 2013 – “remarkable.”
Daley, with the winner of the claim, who is 20 years older than him, reported last year, but says that the difference in years never meant problems.
“When you are so young” – at the age of 14, he attended the first Olympics, and three years later his father died – said, it is hard to find someone of the same age who would experience similar ups and downs.
A couple of June adopted a child, Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, and Daley says that this changed his "full view".
“If I were to be asked last year, everything would be to say that “I have to reach the gold medal”, he said.
“But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was if he already had tickets to London in 2012, because he wanted to sit in the first row.
I couldn't tell him, "This time you won't be in the first row, Dad," he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and he was dead did I finally have to admit that he was not invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and reached the bronze medal.
"I knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life – to dive into the Olympics before the home community. There was no better feeling," he said.
This was also inspired by his first selection of songs – The Music Channel Heather Small, which followed him in the preparations for the Olympics and at which his skin is still stuck.
The Desert Island Discs play at BBC Radio 4 every week at 11.15 (BST).
Unprepared Mickelson was the president of Ryder's court on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in Ryder's Cup, but he'll have to go back in the form of not becoming an accident border.
Mickelson, who will be participating in the two-week event for record 12 years, has left Captain Fury to sit in the four Saturdays.
Instead of being at the centre of the event as often as it was for the United States, the five-time winner survived partly as a cheerleader and partly in improving his games to repair what was more difficult for him.
Given that even at the top of the career, the 48-year-old does not match the best narrow Le Golf National game where the long ice is inevitably punishing the wrong hits.
And if only the game wouldn't be scary enough, Mickelson would be dealing with the British Open Francescom Molinary on Sunday in the ninth match this week, which in the run-up to win all four games this week linked to the newsman Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who have four smaller games at the beginning of the 12 games, started well, would be able to prove Mickelson's game decisive.
Fury expressed his trust in his man, or he didn't say much.
“He fully understands the role he played today, he hugged me behind his back and hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
"There's a lot of trust in you.
He is one of the famous and in the past, and also this week he has made an exceptional contribution to the team.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it went out and we thought it should be done.
He wants to play, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will record Nick Falda on Sunday for the largest number of games played in the Ryder Cup crash.
This could mark the conclusion of Ryder's career, which never really matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven equations, but Fury said that his presence in the team also brings some unacceptable benefits.
"It's fun, sarcastic, funny, likes to work crazy from people and it's wonderful to have it in the crew room," he explained.
"I think younger players were having fun when they moved this week with him, which was fun to see."
Gives a lot more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon be gained
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage can easily be turned into an uncomfortable ride at the start of the last day of the game for individuals in Ryder.
Young Danec debuted in 1997 at the Valderrama game, where the side of which the captain was Seva Ballesteros had five points of advantage in front of the Americans, but through the goal she was only privileged to the hair, with the result of 141⁄2-131/2.
“Don’t forget that we had a great advantage in Valderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but hardly,” said Bjorn (on the picture) after watching the team Class of 2018 , who won with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and announced at the Le Golf National playground 10-6.
So history tells me and everyone on the team that the wedding isn't over yet.
Play the full tomorrow.
Go and do what you need to do.
It's not over until it's like that on the table.
We have the goal of winning this castle, and we need to stay focused on it.
It has been saying that I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we also know well who is on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn added, excited about the game of his players in the challenging game: "I would never have been in a hurry here.
Tomorrow's gonna be a different day.
Tomorrow will be the front game of individuals, so it will have to be handled differently.
It's nice to have a partner when things go well, and when you're there alone, your abilities of the golfer are tested to the end.
This is a message you need to convey to players: Tomorrow you need to get the best out of yourself.
Now leave your partner behind, and he has to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they used to play as a partner, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who reached three points of four.
Furik himself was already on both sides of the transformations in the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a defeater when Europe performed the "Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every awesome word,” he was answered when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999, told his players on the last day of the game.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we would like to start as fast as we saw in Brooklyn as we saw in Medina.
When that start gets the stamina, it's a lot of pressure on the middle of the game.
We created a proper setting and put the boys in a way we felt we would do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead a battle and meet Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
“In this group of boys, I decided on this order, because I think it covers the whole schedule,” Bjorn said about the choice of individuals.
New German warship suspended
The latest German Navy frigate should be handed over in 2014 to replace the old-fashioned warships from the cold war, but the local municipalities have reported that due to system failures and the rapid increase in costs will not be at least until the following year.
The transfer of the ship ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading ship of the new class Frigate Baden-Wuerttemberg, is now transferred to the first half of 2019, says Officer Die Zeit, who mentions the military representative.
The fleet should join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project poses worrying questions after delivery.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships, commissioned in 2007, will replace the ageing Bremen Frigate Class.
It is expected that they will have a strong top, a variety of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles and some cover technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer distances between maintenance – the latest frigates should be able to stay outside the port of residence for up to two years.
The constant delay, however, means that the top military ships, which would allow Germany to have an influence over the sea, have already become obsolete by the time of application, says Officer Die Zeet.
Unhappily F125 frugata appeared on the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
The first time that happened, the sailor returned the ship to the ship after the delivery.
The reasons for the return are known only a few, and the German municipalities have identified a number of key 'programms and technical weaknesses' which would make the warship useless if it were to be sent to a combat mission.
The lack of software was particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class would run a crew with about 120 sailors – only half of the working force on the older Bremen class frigates.
It has also proved that the ship is very difficult, which reduces its capacity and restricts the possibilities of the Navy for its future upgrade.
The 7,000-ton vessel ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ should be twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by the Germans in the second world war.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the whole project has also become a problem – including training the crew.
This is expected to reach EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion) from the beginning of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the sea power is diminishing in Germany.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the leader of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the sailors were actually "decreasing vessels suitable for travel."
The officer said that the issue had become heated over time because the old ships had broken down and the replacement vessels had not been provided.
He complained that sailors could not join any of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships.
The National Fund Listens to the Secret Life of Netopers
A new research is being carried out on the holding in the Scottish Highlands, in which they try to find out how bats use food when hunting for food.
They hope that the results will further highlight the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help direct future conservation activities.
In the study, scientists of the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small bats and small bats and brown bats and round bats at Inverewe Gardens in the Wester Ross area.
Special recorders will be installed at the key sites to monitor the activities of bats throughout the entire season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using manual detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings will confirm the frequency of netopers calls and what kind of actions they are doing.
They will then prepare a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their conduct throughout the province.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Adviser, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are most suitable for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of lawns and the conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
The number of nettle populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work affecting shelter and habitat loss.
The risk also represents wind turbines and lighting, as well as mussels and certain types of chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats aren't actually blind.
Because of nighttime fishing habits, they help themselves more with their ears than with their eyes.
For the precise determination of errors and obstacles on the way, they shall use a pre-fine echolocation technique.
NTS, which is responsible for providing more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land by country, does not take the country very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out investigations, screenings and temporary rescue.
At the property of Thrave in the Dumfries and Galloway area, the organization has set up the first and for now the only Scottish reserve, specifically designed by bats.
The manager of David Thompson's estate says it's an ideal territory for them.
"We have an excellent area for bats on Thrava," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all quality habitats.
However, there is still a lot of knowledge about bats, so the work we are doing here and in other properties will help us to better understand what they need to succeed."
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of netopers prior to carrying out maintenance work on holdings, as possible accidental destruction of a single netopers relative could result in death of up to 400 females and young people, which could mean the loss of the entire local population.
The bats are protected, therefore they are forbidden to be killed, tortured, or disturbed, and their relatives are also forbidden to be destroyed.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish leader of the NPT, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: "We still need to learn a lot about our bats and for many species we just don't know how well their populations are being treated."
Ronaldo rejects the allegations of rape, and lawyers prepare for the German trial
Cristiano Ronaldo pointed out that the rape charges he was supposed to commit were “false news” and said that people wanted to “promot themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing for the German magazine's lawsuit with Der Spiegel, who has published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of strengthening the American woman, Kathryn Mayorg, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he would then pay her $375.000 for the silence of the event.
In contrast to 142 million followers in Instagram Live video several hours after reporting, Ronaldo, 33, marked the report as "false news"
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said was false news," the gold ball winner said in the camera five times.
"By using my name, they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which belongs to the work I do.
I'm a happy man and I want to be good to everyone," the smiling player added.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing themselves for the Der Spiegel report on the charges, which were referred to as "an unacceptable report on suspicion of private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would claim compensation for “an amount of non-monetary damage corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident was to occur in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel apartment in Las Vegas.
In the documentation submitted to the District Court of Clark in Nevada, after a meeting at the Mayorg club with Ronald, he should return to the player's room and make it an analytical effort.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after that event and told her that “99% is a good man”, which disappoints only “one percent”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed sexual relations, but described it as an agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, and later she agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because there was “a terrible battle of revenge” and cared for “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old claims that he wants to cancel the settlement because of the alleged event, he continues to have severe trauma.
Ronaldo was just prior to the alleged attack from Real Madrid in Manchester United, and this summer, after an agreement worth $100 million, he moved to the Italian Grand Juventus.
Brexit: United Kingdom would "be sorry" for the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "be sorry forever" if it lost the status of the leading world car manufacturer after the break, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was 'anxious' that Toyota UK told the BBC that the UK withdrawal from the EU would temporarily suspend production in a factory in Burnston near Derby without an agreement.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the delay on the margin in the case of brexit without agreement could lead to job losses.
The factory Burnston, produced by Toyota model Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that in the event of Britain leaving the European Union without agreement at the end of March, production in our factory would be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, Toyot's managing director at the factory Burnston.
Concern about how the outcome of the European Union without agreement will affect cross-border trade has also been expressed by other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Hondo, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said that after Brexit for a month, she would shut down her factory Mini in Oxford.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain in the case of brexit.
Toyota's production line operates in accordance with the principle of "in the right time", with suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU coming every 37 minutes.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom of America failed to reach agreement, this could lead to a disturbance at the borders for which representatives of the Panogue say they could cause a halt and a lack of work.
Toyota, in its factory in Derbyshire, could not be compatible for more than one day, said representatives of the company, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly designed to avoid such border checks".
"We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the present success, but to seize this opportunity," said Today BBC Radio 4.
"The data not only toyote, but also other manufacturers are that we must be absolutely able to continue a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not comment on how long production would be stopped, but warned in the long term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in the factory for 24 years and is the founder of the United States union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "After my experiences, the lost job never returns."
The government representative said: "We must present a detailed and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
The trumpet meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House says.
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, could be "represented for another week", the White House said on Sunday, due to the ongoing fight against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference, connections between Trump's employees and Russia and the potential opposition of the judiciary.
The question is whether Trump, the envoy of the Attorney-General, will be forgiven and threatened by Mueller's independence, has been fueling Washington's speeches for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a hearing machine to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the President on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein's missing the report.
On the last Monday, he visited the White House, in the middle of a report on his intention to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then held at the United Nations Conference in New York, was announced Thursday.
Trump said that Rosenstein 'would rather not forgive', and then the meeting was held to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee, in which they spoke of Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of improper sexual conduct, Dr Ford.
On Friday, Trump identified a one-week investigation of the charges against Kavanough, which further postponed the Senate's vote.
Trump's press representative, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not yet fixed for him. It could happen this week, depending on everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court, and could be postponed for another week.
We'll see. I always want to make sure you're informed."
Some of the reporters would have objected to this, and Sanders hasn't convened a White House meeting with the press since September 10th.
The director of the show Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sandersova said that the frequency of meetings is not going to attribute resistance to the "setting up" of TV reporters, but said, "You could not deny that they are putting up."
Then she mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president conducts more press conferences than any president before him," she said, adding without mentioning the source: "We have looked at the numbers."
The meetings will still be held," Sanders said. "But if journalists can turn their question directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
This is what we are trying to do, and you have seen that we have done this frequently in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with the guests.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, when he appeared voluntarily and partially bizarre in front of the assembled journalists.
Letter from the Minister of Health for EU Workers in NHS Scotland on Brexit-related fears
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and the desire to continue the work after the break.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom came out from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to paying the costs of applying to regulate the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued on exit, when I came closer to the decision this fall.
However, the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible outcome scenario without an agreement.
I know this has to be a big time for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
In Scotland you can feel completely at home. We want you to stay here very much.”
Christian Abercrombie urgently operated after head injury
The liner of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, has ended an emergency operation against the Vanderbilt Commodores team, reported Mike Organ in The Tennessee magazine.
The chief coach of the State University of Tennessee told reporters that the injury occurred only a little before half an hour ago.
“He came to the edge of the playground and somehow collapsed there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel provided Abercrombie with oxygen on the toy before placing it on the toy and taking it from the toy for further inspection.
An official from the State University of Tennessee told Chris Harris of the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering after surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘the details of the nature/range of the injury are not yet known’ and that the Tennessee State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, currently at the university in Bruxelles, plays for Tennessee State University for the first time since the transition from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he had five hits together before he left the game, and his total number of hits in the season rose to 18 hits.
A higher tax will be charged to foreign customers when they purchase real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people in new plans
The effort will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
Increased tax will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The founder expects her to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of tax on the purchase of properties in the United Kingdom, and the collected money will be for the homeless, today will be reported by Theresa May.
The effort needs to be understood as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to increase taxation for people with high incomes.
The increased tax will be charged to persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and will encourage the government's efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The benefit – which will be charged in addition to the current tax, including raised levels, introduced two years ago for other homes and real estate — could be nothing less than three per cent.
The founder expects to collect up to GBP 120 million per year by introducing the measure.
According to estimates, non-staters of the United Kingdom are expected to buy 13 percent of newly built London properties, resulting in a high price and a heavier purchase of the first property.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the main city – have become ‘the places of spirits’, as the number of customers who spend most of their time away from the country is increasing.
The new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the amount of money to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
A large construction company charged with rising prices by robbing a country that did not actually use it, and Mr. Mayevo called for a discount for affordable housing to repair the British "refuse of housing".
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the monitoring of rentals and the completion of forced displacements without mistake.
In addition, he wants to give the city council greater authority to build new homes.
Ms. Mayeva said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my Prime Minister's leadership to the restoration of British dreams – that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means the correction of our non-working housing market.
The Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it cannot be true that for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies, the purchase of homes is as simple as for British citizens in garages.
For too many people, dreams about their own home are all too far away, and the humiliation of homelessness remains all too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to run the Scotland Club"
Chief Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to once become the Scotland Club Manager.
The 42-year-old Scottish enjoys the challenge of the North-East Club, which currently holds third place in the First League, with three points less than the first-class.
At the Light Stadium, he moved this summer, after St Mirren took him back to the Scottish Championship in the last season.
"For my country, I wanted to play as a player.
I took the B chapter, and that's what Ross said about the BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
“But I grew up seeing Scotland frequently in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that drew me back.
I would only be offered this opportunity if I was successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors were Dick Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Allo Athletic team, who had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, said that as a successor of such great names, he did not feel afraid.
“The success of me is measured by the question “Can I take this club back to the League?”.
In view of the structure and capacity, this club undoubtedly belongs to the First League,’ he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but it’d probably be a success only if the club could get there again.”
Ross is doing the manager's work only three years after he was the assistant manager in Dumbarton and 15 months of training staff of Hearts.
Alloi then helped to prevent the third league failure, and St. Mirren took the title of the championship championship in the next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever while playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real breakthrough”, recalled Alloe’s adoption.
"I was really convinced that management was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It's funny because I've been a good player, I've had a pretty good time with it, and I've also achieved some more success.
But the game can become demanding.
Every week, we have to face a lot of things.
In the sense of stress and pressure at work, I still struggle with it, but I just feel like I'm doing the right thing for myself.
I've always wanted to run a club and now I'm doing it. In my skin, I now feel the most comfortable in my adult life."

Result of the investigation: the ideal time for beer is Saturday at 17.30
The summer heat increased the revenues of heavy-duty British pubs, but also increased the pressure on chain restaurants.
The pools of pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, the business adviser of the CGA, who prepared the data, said: “The constant solar time and participation of England in the world era that lasted longer than expected meant that July followed a similar pattern as in June last month, when the income of pubs increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were affected even more.
The drop in transport in restaurants by 1.8% in June has increased in July.
The circulation in pubs and bars with drinks increased in comparison with each other more than the traffic in restaurants decreased.
Due to the time of the sun, sales in pubs that offer food in particular have also decreased, but not as dramatic as in restaurant managers.
Looks like people just wanted to go to the drink.
In different pubs and bars, the sales of alcohol increased by 6.6 per cent in one month and the sales of food decreased by three per cent.’
Paul Newman from the group of analysts for free time and hospitality RSM said: “These results continue to be the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The market in hospitality remains the biggest factor in the time and impact of major social or sports events.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the 4.8% fall at the mid-year level will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
For food-producing locals in the long summer, it would not be possible to arrive at the wrong time and only time will tell if recovery will be necessary to bring the moderate temperatures that we experienced in August."
The total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2,7 % in July, indicating the slow introduction of trade marks.
Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales criterion in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 business groups with a total traffic of more than 9 billion pounds and is implemented by an industrial reference.
One of the five children has a secret account on the social network that they hide from their parents
The research has shown that one of the five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — has a secret account on the social network that is hidden from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 dikes showed the growth of fake Instagram sites
News reinforces the fear of publication of sex-related content
Twenty percent of dijacs said they had a ‘main’ account intended for parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, is actually on social networks the account they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 dikes showed the rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts.
The news reinforced the fear of publication of sex-related content.
Twenty percent of dijacs have said that they manage the censored “main” account, as shown to parents, and also have private accounts.
The mother, who accidentally ran into the secret side of a 13-year-old daughter, noticed that her daughter invited visitors to send her away.
The research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools showed that they have two profiles of 40 percent between 11 and 18 years of age, and half of them admit that they have a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are being tempted and create a web space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Committee
Elid Doyle was appointed to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director of the annual General Assembly of the Administrative Committee.
Doyle is the most outstanding Scottish athletes in the field and in the open, and President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who focus on sports to take advantage of its extensive international experience in the past decade.
“Eilid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic communities. We are confident that an athlete in Scotland with her involvement in the committee will gain a great deal,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm thrilled to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help with sports in Scotland."
The American , who won from the total of four Olympic medals in the course of 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, has lost the ability to speak after a transitional ischemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: "A month ago I was hit by a drop.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said he'd only tell me if I could get back to life and to what extent.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and I'm running agility exercise today!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!’
An ad for a breast pump comparing mothers to cows has divided online opinions
The company producing breast pumps divided opinions with an ad comparing mothers with cows in the mill.
In order to start the marketing of ‘the first silent portable breast pump’, the consumer technology company Elvie published a provocative music video ad to show mothers all the freedom that the aid provides.
Four true mothers dance in a sheep sheep society, filled with hay, on a song that includes the following text: “Yes, I do, but there is no tail,” and “if you haven’t noticed, these are not my cuts, these are my breasts.”
The collection goes on to say, "Expect, extract, feed the baby, extract, extract, squeeze the baby."
However, an ad published on Facebook's website has caused considerable harassment on the Internet.
At 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, he received mixed reactions from viewers, many saying that he was a joke to the milk industry.
"The use of cows for advertising this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they're pregnant and they're cooking to produce milk, but their babies are stealing it in the first days after the pollination," she wrote.
The breast pump Elvie discreetly adapts to breast-feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Of course it is traumatic for both mothers and young people.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers holding their children?"
Someone else added: "A voice completely without feeling."
The others praised the ad, and one of the women admitted that she thought the song "to be funny".
"That seems like a brilliant idea.
I'd buy it too if I was still breast-feeding.
I felt just like a cow when I was sucking.
The ad is a few crazy, but I understood it as it was thought.
It's a brilliant product," wrote the other.
Someone commented: “It’s a funny ad that aims at mothers who drain their milk (usually at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.”
This is not an ad that would praise or condemn the dairy industry.’
At the end of the video, a group of women discovers that they were dancing with secret pumps in the dark.
The concept of action is that many women who are breast-feeding say they feel like cows.
However, the pump Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wire or tube and is discreetly attached to breast-feeding, allowing women to move, hold a child, and even activities on the free during milking.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD in mothers, continued to comment. "Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation."
With the passage of the parallel between the women who are sucking milk, and the cows milkers, we wanted to pay attention to the pumping of milk and all its challenges, and then in a fun way that women can connect, to show an incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump came to the headlines.
During the London week of fashion, the mother of two children walked on the maneken road for the designer Marto Jakubowski when she used the product.
Hundreds of children of silent migrants moved to the tent camp at the Texas border
The number of children detained migrants has risen dramatically, even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the grave rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump’s administration have made it difficult for children to hand over to sponsors.
Traditionally, the majority of sponsors of undocumented migrants are afraid to be able to stay in the country with a child's request.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of households would have to hand out fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Agency, spoke before the congress about arresting more than ten people who were asked to sponsor young people without a warrant.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of those who are both sponsors or home members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are punished by foreigners.
That is why we are continuing to search for these individuals," Mr Albence said.
With a view to speeding up the treatment of children, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within one month after they were detained, and not after 60 days, which was the previous standard, said workers in the shelter.
Many will be shown by videoconferencing, not personally, in order to defend themselves before a immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for aid will be quickly expelled.
As long as children are in custody, they are more likely to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent explosions or attempts to escape, as reported by workers in shelters and reports that have occurred in the system in recent months.
Protesters said that these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as Tornill, where the signs of child stress are more likely to remain unattainable because of their size.
They added that moving children into a tent, not to be emotionally prepared or given the opportunity to speak to friends, may complicate the trauma many of them face.
Syria calls for the immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
In a statement from the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Mouale of Syrian refugees called for their return home, even though war had already taken place in the country for eight years.
Moulem, who also carries out the duties of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil were illegal, in the face of the fight against terrorism, and that "they would also act accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," the assembly said.
Moualem said that "war against terrorism" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011, and millions had to leave home, " almost finished".
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this world battle until we clear the Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United Nations has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, who primarily train and advise the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs, who oppose President Basar Al Asada.
France has more than 1,000 troops in this territory in the war-distributed country.
With regard to the refugees, Mouale said that the conditions were appropriate for their return, and he accused the ‘some Western countries’ of ‘widening of unreasonable fears’ which the refugees had convinced them to stay abroad.
"We have invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to their easier return," he said.
"They are changing the political issue, which should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have assured Syria that it will not receive renewable resources until Asad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
The diplomats of the United Nations say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a Tampon zone in the last important rebellion, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented the extensive attacks of the Syrian forces supported by Russia in the province in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that he had an agreement on a clear deadline, and expressed hope that military intervention would be directed against the jihadist, including fighters from the Nusra Front, associated with Al-Qaido, who would be "rooted".
The envoy of the United Nations, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that he will soon convene the first meeting of a new committee composed by members of the government and the opposition in order to prepare a peace constitution for Syria and press the way to the election.
Moualem defined the conditions of the Syrian Government for cooperation in the Committee, saying that the work of the Committee should be limited to ‘the review of the articles of the current Constitution’ and warned against interference.
Why Trump will reach second term
After this decision, Mr Trump will win again in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers are likely to hope, his presidency will soon end with questioning and scandal.
What would no doubt be "the most dramatic finals of the presidency at any time!"
For now, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, CNN’s visibility has doubled by more than 1.05 million at the time of the largest viewing, while MSNBC’s visibility has increased by almost 1.6 million.
The Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers, which was more than four years ago after Nielsen, when it was 1,7 million, the “The Rachel Maddow Show” on the MSNBC channel reached the largest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers on a nightly news.
“It is a fire that attracts people because it is something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the drama director of the “Designed Survivor” drama, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a well-known song comedy and author of the book “Only funny parts: and a few strong truths about cheering at the Club of Hollywood Boys,” offers a different explanation.
Remember the taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd like Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” she told me.
It's fun in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what is seen on television, the Washington story could decide on the future of Roe v. Wad, depending on whether immigrant families can reunite and health of the global economy.
The hatch is a luxury that can only be enjoyed by the most privileged viewers.
However, the sixth look around the table of experts discussing the use of a source “from a deep background” for the book “Strah” Bob Woodward, 15,000 USD worth of new leather jackets (“wear, fat, with a blow,” said Officer The Washington Post) and the consequences of the shocking descriptions of Trump, khm, anatomy.
Sam, for example, I'll never look at Super Maria again.
“Part of his start, which inspires the impression of real performances, is that he offers something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the “Pawn Stars” show on the establishment of Trump’s show and day-to-day dramas (dweet with N.F.L., praise Kim Jong Una).

He couldn't stand off, nor when Brett Kavanaugh confronted the Senate board, and the future of the Supreme Court was suspended in the air.
“I remember creating all these crazy plays at the time and people were saying, ‘This is the end of Western civilization’,” Mr Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

External money is obtained in preparation for the narrowest intermediate election
It is not surprising that in the 17th Pennsylvania district, there was a flood of money, since two candidates were in the race for the same seat because of the redeployment of the congress districts.
This recently split into a new suburban district of Pittsburgh is the home of Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who won his seat at the special elections this spring in the second district.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12 district, which is heavily covered by the new 17th district.
The cards were re-scinded when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court of January ruled that the old districts were anti-stained for the benefit of the Republicans.
The theme of the new 17th district was the fight to finance the campaign between the main foreign financial bodies, the Congress Committee on Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely monitored Markov special elections for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been held by the Republican for more than a decade, while President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political commentators attribute a slight advantage to Democrats.
In the United States, they thought about sanctions against Salvador because of China's support and then withdrew.
Diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varelo in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners lost the leadership of Trump.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to resign US leaders of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to “soon decisions to stop the recognition of Taiwan”, said Heather Nauert, the Ministry's representative at the beginning of the month.
However, the sanctions were considered for Salvador, which was estimated to receive US$ 140 million in 2017, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including the restriction of financial aid and the targeted restriction of issuing visas, would seriously affect this Central American country with high unemployment and the number of murders.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in preventing migration towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior government officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue, concluding their thoughts on the punishments for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now responsible for making statements to the participants of the conference, which is now planned for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance that the US government assigns to the meeting.
After that, three US envoys returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House for Mr Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss them on anonymity basis.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the government and spoke about it on the basis of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The following unpleasant news could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible impediment to the judiciary, which is now very much evidence in public records.
Mr Mueller should also point to whether Mr. Trump's campaign was involved with Russia in the attack on the American elections.
If the congress changes its hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer immediately before the jury of his colleagues is ready to speak his electors again.
There are many issues in this regard, and I do not want to argue that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, as well as not his lineage in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long we could be fighting.
In 1938, German officials were ready to take a blow against Hitler if he was to be defeated in the West and supported in Munich by Czechoslovakia.
We failed to miss the opportunity to escape the years of the worship that followed.
Such breakthroughs change the course of history and accelerate or impede the inexorable course of democracy.
The Americans are dealing with several of these breakthroughs right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump forgives Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on the lookout since this officer reported that last year he proposed a secret recording of the President and speculated about his incompatibility to this position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the official's report was incorrect.
"How will we respond if the requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair or if it is appointed a Supreme Judge despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-term elections for a convention that will require the responsibility of Mr. Trump?
If we're going to miss out on these tests, we're going to have a long winter democracy.
But I'm sure it won't fail us because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovenian Jew who deported her in Auschwitz to the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, she immigrated to America, and she ordered me 60 years later to burn a shabby candle on the table with my sandwiches.
How could such an inheritance not be optimistic about our future?"

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic before facing Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, making it clear that winning them over the Austrians after an impressive campaign against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month will put them in a convincing position to qualify from the Group of the European League.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from appearing in the season for the first time before a 2:2 rhyme against Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use it as a stepping-place for greater achievements.
“It was a worthy point for us because Villareal is a strong team,” said a 31-year-old.
"We have entered the game in the belief that we can achieve something and take the point.
Perhaps we could win at the end, but the overall score is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, and we showed up and we were better off in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope that we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am confident that we can do our best and achieve a positive result.
Last year it was definitely difficult, depending on what happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I now have a good feeling about this place.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy; training is good.
I hope that we can continue now, leave the last season behind and achieve success."
Poor Women's Sleep for Fear of Savings
Even though the respondents had a clear idea of how to care for them, few people spoke to their family members about it.
Half of the respondents to the Nationalwide insurance investigation said they talked to the spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to children about it.
“People want family members to worry about them, but they don’t try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the Life Insurance Sector at Nationalwide.
You can start the next way.
Talk to your spouse and children: Families can't prepare for you if you don't talk to her on time.
Talk to the counselor and the family about where and how you want to get care, as this can be an important factor in assessing the cost.
Include a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of long-term funding may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policy to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own funds if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles during the transition.
Choose a health representative by setting up a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that experts will take into account your health wishes if you cannot communicate.
Think, too, of the authority of the person in charge of your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are not able to do so on your own.
Do not forget about the details: Imagine that your elderly parent urgently needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.

In Ilfracomb, a man was shot several times by an air gun
A man who returned home at night was shot several times by an air gun.
The shooter, at the age of 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracomb, Devon, when he was shot several times in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 after British time, as "unusual action".
She didn't see the victim of her attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, but the police have called on witnesses to report.
Disasters and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, officials said, and the number of victims should be increased.
At the time of the interruption of communication, the rescuers from the Dongal Regent, the area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of magnitude 7.5, could not receive any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake in Palu.
Several key data on the Gulf and the Danube region of Sulavesia:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesia, a province that is located at the end of the narrow valley on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi and is expected to have 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
It reached the province extending over 300 km (180 km) of the coast on the north-west of the island of Sulavezi.
Regents, the administrative unit under the province, were estimated to have 299,000 inhabitants in 2017.
The main economic activities of the province of Central Sulavezi are fisheries and agriculture, particularly in the central region of Dongal.
In the province there is also an important activity of mining nickel, which is largely carried out in Moroval, on the opposite side of Sulavesia.
After reporting to the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disaster Relief over the past 100 years, Palu and Dongal have been repeatedly affected by tsunamis.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongal.
In 1996 the tsunami also affected northern Dongalo and caused the death of nine people.
Indonesia is sitting on a tremendously active Pacific fire meal, so earthquakes regularly occur here.
In recent years some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been:
2004: More earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that affected 14 countries, resulting in 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian assessment, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The type of strong earthquakes hit West Sumatra late March and early April.
More than a hundred people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake of magnitude 6,8 affected the southern part of Java, the most populated Indonesian island, and triggered tsunamis that flooded its southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: The magnitude earthquake 7.6 occurred near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The magnitude earthquake of 7.5 affected one of Mentawai islands and triggered tsunamis of up to 10 meters high that destroyed the ducata village and caused about 300 people to die.
2016: Pidi Jaya Regent was hit by the earthquake in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, the tsunamis did not set in, but more than 100 people died.
2018: More earthquakes affected the Indonesian tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily held thousands of tourists.
The arrest of Sarah Palin's oldest son for family violence
Track Palina, the oldest son of the former governor and Vice-President Sarah Palin, were arrested for charges of assault.
A 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for the amount of violence in the family, the prevention of family violence and the opposition of arrest, the Alaska State Troopers police agency reported on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin was aware that when she tried to call the police to report a alleged criminal offence, she took the phone out of her hand.
The fuel was installed at the Mat-Su Prefecture and is held in an unsecured guarantee amounting to USD 500, the KTUU TV network reported.
He appeared at the courthouse on Saturday, where he said he was "unfortunately innocent", when asked about the protest, the network reported.
The fuel was charged with three Class A violations, which means that it could be closed up to one year and punished with a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with one B-fraction, punishing with one day in prison and depth in the amount of USD 2000.
Fire of crime is not charged for the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palina.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a suspected attack.
The case is currently before the Alaskan Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of violence in the family, interfering with the application of violence in the family and possession of weapons in an alcoholized state in connection with the event.
He said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin criticised the Veteran groups when violent behaviour of her son linked to post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Floods with tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulavezi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication networks are broken down, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just near central Sulavesia, which lies north-west of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing a moment of earthquake.
When he was hit by tsunamis at the beach, hundreds of people were detained at the festival in Pala.
Federal prosecutors rarely demand a death penalty for the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York require a death sentence for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect of a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died.
Saipov, 30, was intended to use a rental truck to carry on a road attack along the West Side motorway in Lower Manhattan when he drove several pedestrians and bicycles in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov 's intentional' killed eight victims and 'intended' caused serious bodily harm, is included in the notification of the death penalty claim lodged in the South of New York.
According to the court document, there may be a reason for the death penalty for any of the charges.
Several weeks after the attack, Saipova's large federal court informed the defendant in 22 points, which included eight charges for murder in aid to rape, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and the charge for violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "significant planning and siege", the prosecutors who described Saipov's way as "sudden, cruel and advanced."
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov has caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelinija, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Draka, Ariel Erlija, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendoze and Alejandro Damiana Pagnuccoa" is listed in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The District Court of the South has pronounced the last death sentence ten years ago.
Indicted by Khalid Barnes for the murder of two drug suppliers, the sentence finally turned him into a prison of life in September 2009.
The death penalty was last pronounced in New York City in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had killed him because of the invasion of the Soviet Union between the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg died on the electric table on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show any regret during the days and months following the attack, following the statements in the court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigator that he felt good about what he had done.
After the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the video ISIS that he had seen on the phone to carry out the attack.
The police also said that they had requested an ISIS flag release in their hospital room.
In view of the 22 points of the indictment, he was declared innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipova, said that they were "evidently disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to demand a death penalty instead of taking a confession of guilt in return for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only prolong the suffering in relation to these events,” Patton said.
Saip's defence group has asked the prosecutors not to demand a death penalty before this.

The former leader of Ukipa said that politicians must "suffer the heat" of the Euro-Schools when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Member Peter Bone said on a trip to Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "now be outside" if Mr Farage was secretary for the break.
However, the challenge faced by Mayev in coordinating its deep-separated species has also been highlighted by the Turks, who have given up on a separate protest against the Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep his plan in the loop between the attacks of the Brexit defenders, the Brexit opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that Mayev, in Brussels, try to reach an agreement despite opposition and force the Europeans and the Laborists to choose between their package and "caosome".
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave (Department means departure) assembly in Solihul that "he wants to get rid of Chequers".
He said that we should appoint Mr Farage as a spokesperson and assign him the responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
“If he were in charge, he would be out by now,” he said.
This member from Wellingborough added, "I'm going to take a break, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
He described his opposition to the EU with the following words: "We did not fight in world wars to be servants now.
In our own country, we want to adopt our own laws."
Mr. Bone rejected the proposals that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed and want to stay in the EU is completely unrealistic."
At the meeting, also, was the Turkish brexist Andrea Jenkyns, who told the rapporteurs: “I simply say: ‘Ministerial President, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, but it is also unpopular with our customers and our activists who are active on the streets and even lead us to the election.
Please leave Chequers and start listening.’
In the Communication, addressed to Mr Mayev, she added: "The Prime Minister maintains his service when he fulfils his promises."
At the meeting, Mr Farage said that policymakers should be given "a feeling of warmth" if they intend to issue a decision adopted at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to release the brexite and we're gathered today to tell them, 'We won't let you do this."
In the message, the enthusiastic crowd added: "I want you to give our political class, which is on the subject of the Brexit issue, a feeling of warmth."
"We are mobilizing the human army of this country, which has given us victory at the breakout, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the hostages walked through Birmingham, where they had a two - room meeting in the city center.
After the group was set up this weekend, the Toryci flag was waved against Brexit.
Lord Adonis's labyristic tribe laughed at the conservatives because of security problems when using the client's application after opening the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for a free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is nothing like a good brexit," he added.
Warren's possible pursuit of the president's position will be "exactly studied"
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said that he would "determine cooperation in the presidential race" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a meeting with citizens in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warrenov, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will compete for re-election against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by Trump's election campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is at the centre of speculation so that it can deal with Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke event on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the city hall voters since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she was going to trade for the president's seat.
Warren said it's time to "make a woman's sin in Washington and repair our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top."
Arrest after the death of LSU Sims in the shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that she had arrested a suspect on Friday to shoot the LSU Wayda Sims basketball player.
The police station in Baton Rouge reported a 20-year-old Simpson arrest at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help in identifying the man on the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday near the campus of the South University.
“Wayde Sims suffered a head shot and therefore finally died,” said the police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media, reported the 247sports network.
Wade got involved in protecting a friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted to hearing that he was at the end of the incident, that he had a gun, and that he shot Wayd Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a warrant and taken to the East Baton Rouge Paris Police Department in custody.
Sims, a 198-centimeter young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the last season with 10 beginnings, on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps at the game.
Russian Grand Award: Lewis Hamilton approached the world champion's title, and the team ordered him to leave the victory to Sebastian Vettlu
On Saturday it became the moment Valtteri Bolts qualified in front of Levis Hamilton, clear that "the Mercedes team will have a strong impact on the race".
Bottas had a good start in the yard and almost left Hamilton on the dry floor when he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettla to attack his teammate.
Vettel took the first to the box and let Hamilton drive on the transport track, which should be decisive.
Mercedes took the box later and left it behind for Vettl, but after some driving action, Hamilton noticed that the driver of Ferrari's non-refoulement left the inside of the door open and risked that after two moves to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started with the last type of network and was on his 21st birthday in the seventh place until the end of the first round.
Then, most of the game was without changing the tire, as he was going to perform a quick finish, heat up Kimia Raikkonen and occupy the fourth place.
He finally took the box in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could not increase the speed, so the fourth place was occupied by Raikkonen.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri's a fantastic vehicle all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he let me out.
The team has done a really great job to reach the first and second places," Hamilton said.
That was a really weak body speaker.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday because of her insistence that she did not disclose Christine Blasey Ford, who was the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, charged with sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly touch Ford's testimony before the Senate's commission of inquiry, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad, corrupt and false".
"The only beautiful thing that can happen that happened in the Senate in the last days that we can see anger when you can see that people are evil, corrupt and false," he said.
"When you look at the announcements and revelations, people say, 'No, I didn't do it'."
I didn't do that."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you find out?
Remember her answer... you revealed the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Okay, hold on a second.
We discovered him... no, we didn't," he added about the senator's impression.
Fordova sent a letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the media was released in early September – but Feinstein denied that it had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusation, I didn’t disclose her letter,” The Hill Feinstein’s officer told the Commission after reporting.
"She asked me for trust, and I kept her confidential as she asked."
Her refusal apparently did not match with the president who said at the meeting on Saturday night: "I tell you, it was a really bad speech.
It may not be, but it was the worst speech I've ever seen."
In defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of improper sexual conduct, the president suggested that democracy abuse the charges for its own purposes.
“They are determined to regain their power with all possible means.
You have seen evil, hatred, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to drive to fight for power and control,' the president said after the media site's report.
Elitna disease: Dundee Stars v. Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer killed two goals for the Great Against Dundee.
Dundee Stars were redeemed for a Friday's loss in the elite league against Belfast Giants with a win at the Saturday match in Dundee at 5:3.
Giants were told early on two goals at Patrick Dwyer's and Francis Beauvilleer's targets.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were equal to home, and then Dwyer regained the advantage of Giants.
Francois Bouchard was equal to Dundee before two naked Lundvald Nielsens won their victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elith League for Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee at 2:1 on Friday night from the back.
This was the fourth season season between teams, during which the Giants won the previous three matches.
Dwyer reached his first goal in the game in four minutes with 3:35 at Kendall McFaull's assistant, Beauvillier, who won four minutes later, and gave up David Rutherford.
In the intensive introduction at 13:10 Sullivan again led the game home side, and Matt Marquardt gave Cownia an equation at 15:16.
Dwyer took care of the management of the Giants on vacation when he won his second goal at the end of the first third.
The domestic side was gathered again, and the remnant was rewarded with a violent bull at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen lead Dundee at the end of the second third and to ensure victory with the fifth goal of his team of half-thirds and to ensure victory with the fifth goal of his team.
The Giants, now losing four of their last five games, will play the next game on Friday home in Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller, with his death, enabled more than a hundred people on the plane to escape from the quake
The air traffic controllers in Indonesia celebrate as heroes, after sacrificing his life so that the plane could fly with more than a hundred people safely.
In the Friday earthquake on the island of Sulavezi, which followed his tsunamis, more than 800 people died, and many were missing.
The area continues to be under stress by powerful thunderstorms, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Paul.
Although the employees fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung did not leave his job at the heavily glamoured control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He remained in it so that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the flight path, could be safely taken.
Then he jumped out of the control tower because he thought he was climbing.
He died at the hospital later.
The representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that the decision might have saved more than a hundred lives, reported the Australian Media House ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter to take him to a larger hospital in another town from Balikpapan in Kalimantan.
We're sorry we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"Our hearts are in the market when we hear it," he added.
In the meantime, authorities are afraid that the number of deaths could be achieved more than a thousand times, as the disaster relief agency in the country said that access to towns in Dongala, Sigia and Boutonga was limited.
“The number of the dead is expected to increase, as many bodies have been destroyed and many have not been reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho’s representative.
Pala, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, the waves, up to six feet [6 m], have been devastated.
Military and commercial aircraft bring assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the rescue vehicle brings the body.
It lacks clean water.
The retail markets have been robbed all over the world.’
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross rushes to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy that can become much worse."
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Pala, saying to the national army: "All of you, please, work night and day to fulfill all the responsibilities associated with evacuation.
Are you ready?» After the CNN report.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now says that one man misses one man after a plane has been hit by a plane in the lagoon.
The airline, which operated a flight headed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says they miss one man after they first reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini announced on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger is missing.
The airlines were told to cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their search for the missing person.
On a call for more information about a passenger than his age or nationality, they did not respond immediately.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew, after the plane hit the water when they tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, the officials said that they had taken seven people to the hospital.
At the airport, it was said that there were eight passengers who were all in stable condition at the hospital on Saturday.
The cause of strumbing and the exact order of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the road.
Some of the witnesses said the plane missed the gun.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had dropped very low.
“That’s extremely good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers were able to pass through the stream of running water to power outputs on the inflammable plane.
He said that the stewardess panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that the mariners who had been repairing the ship nearby also jumped to the aid. They helped to rescue themselves by using an inflatable boat that took people to the ground before the plane sank to about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Air Safety Network data shows that 111 people died in the last two decades of air accidents in Papua New Guinea, but this is the first accident that happened to Air Niugini.
The analyst set the time of the night when the woman was burned alive
The prosecution presented its evidence on Saturday in a retrial to a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
An analysis by the US Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett spoke for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used phone footage to determine the movement of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received information about the location from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night before her death, which contradicted his previous claims, reported Officer The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers when he said he was with a friend Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford talked on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said he was "laughing because he was [my] truck in Nashville."
The second inconsistency was that Tellis said that he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The footage on the phone show that they only met for one week.
Rowlett said that in time after Chambers died on his phone, Tellis erased Chambers' texts, phone calls, and contact details.
“He removed it from his life,” Hale said.
The defence is supposed to present the final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said that the jury should judge the trial later that day.
The High Breed: What is a Conscious hippop?
Hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed Group from Bristol claims that the hippop has distanced from the original political and social engagement.
They want to go back to his roots and re-make a conscious hipop popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons recently experienced a new rise with artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the United Kingdom.
Another black?
The New York Guard accused a couple because they fired her for a "racist" message.
The New York Guard sues a couple because they discriminated against her after receiving the wrong message sent by the mother, who complained that she was "one black."
Couples reject racist behaviour and the prosecution is compared to "exercising".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment in 2016 when the new guard, Giselle Maurice, came to realize that she was black.
‘NOEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ČNKA,’ she wrote to her husband in her message.
But instead of sending him to his husband, she sent him to Mr. Maurice twice.
After finding out what she was doing, the Plasco-Flaxman, who felt “uncomfortable”, forgave Maurice, saying that her leaving guard, who was an African-American, was doing a bad job, so he wanted to hire the Filipino, reported Officer New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a payment for one day's work, and then she and Uber were sent home.
Maurice is now demanding compensation from a couple in the court, amounting to USD 350 per day for a period of six months for the work for which she was first hired, although without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, such things don’t happen,” she told Post on Friday, adding: “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple responded to the charges of racism, claiming that Maurice's forgiveness was reasonable, for they feared that they would no longer be able to trust her.
"The wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"Would you be willing to trust your children to someone to whom you were disobedient, even if that happened because of the motive?
Your newborn baby?
Come on.’
When comparing the complaint to ‘immigration’, Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a child only two months ago and was in a ‘very difficult situation’.
"Will you be proud of someone like that?
This is not nice," the investment bank added.
Although the trial before the court is still pending, the court of public opinion is a couple on social networks because of its conduct and the way in which it thinks quickly.
The readers of the legends about a bear in Paddington were afraid that readers would not associate with the speaker bear, a new letter revealed
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to get into the skin of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It is very fun to find out now that Paddington has become an outstanding success."
She said that her father, who first worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired to write a children's book on a small bear toy, was bitter when she refused her work, added that after his death last year she was the 60th anniversary of the book "Green-Sweet".
As for Paddington’s bear, described as “a very important member of our family”, she said that his father was very proud of his final success.
“It was those people who didn’t like to praise,” she said.
“However, since the bear Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if something had reached your child: You’re proud of her, even though you’re not really doing it alone.
I think that the success of the Paddington bear was in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, he always attributed success to the bear Paddington himself.”
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon their arrival, her daughters were taken to the Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors tried to preserve her life.
“Now she regularly called to say that she really felt bad that she didn’t expect this to happen,” said Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I got Nad's phone call, and he told me she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping, slowly took and left her system.
She's been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing all this is happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a position to be surrounded by family and people.
I really had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperous, who was already complaining about the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, unaware of the trials she was experiencing.
"No one knew," she said.
"I've had my head turned off, and all the time, I have tears in my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this strong feeling of compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women's glue posters to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one in suicide try to turn others away from taking life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Valežan Bridge are sticking posters with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mr. Tyler's son was 13 years old when he fell into depression, and he killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want you to feel like I do every day for any parent,” she said.
Ms. Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with a smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would shed light on every room."
But before he died, he stopped working because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his companion when he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly worried that the domino effect will be triggered."
Ms. Davis made the posters "to let others know that people you can turn to and talk to are available, even if they are friends.
Do not sit quietly – you need to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who was Davies' friend for several years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He did not say that he felt depressed, depressed or otherwise,” she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day he was completely on the ground. When the children opened gifts, he did not make eye contact with them or something like that.”
She said that his death was a severe trauma to them, but they had to be processed: “She cut the hole into the entire family.
She broke us up.
But we must continue and fight."

The future of Bretta Kavanaucha is all the same at the start of the FBI Air Survey
“I thought that if we could actually do what he asked for – after the duration and extent of a limited investigation, this might be a matter for us,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the world would be “disappeared” due to a strong foreign presence.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want FBI investigations?
Their resistance is due to the time in which the investigation would take place.
Until the mid-elections that will take place on 6 November, there are only five weeks left – if Republicans, as expected, are cut short, this will greatly weaken them in the attempt to elect the desired man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called the senator several times to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, who presented him to his current wife Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI prepares the report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh, in the Senate, can gather at least 50 votes, which would have led to the collapse of Mike Pence, Vice-President, from the same position and election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees decreased under Kimo
The number of refugees from North Korea in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un, a South Korean envoy, arrived seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korean Association Ministry, said that last year, 1127 people survived, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were more stringent border control between North Korea and China and the increase in the price required by the people's thiottaps.
Pjongang hasn't commented in public yet.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossed.
Most of them cross China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a highly secured demilitarized area between the two Koreas.
China counts refugees for illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
The relations between the North and the South, which are technically still in the war, have improved significantly in recent months.
In the early part of this month, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stopping the negotiations on denuclearisation.
This happened after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kimo Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on an effort for the Korean half-tongue without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho gave the US sanctions a stop since then.
“Without trust from the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not become unilaterally disillusioned,” Mr Ri said in a statement by the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi named Bretta Kavanaugha as a “historic” and said that it was not appropriate for the service at the Supreme Court
The minority head of Nancy Pelosi's representative's home appointed a candidate for the Bretta Kavanaugha Supreme Court as a "historic" and said that he was significantly inadequate for the service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosijeva did so in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of anything other than that a woman would, if she knew so, be marked “histories”,” Kavanaugh’s fourth statement in front of the Senate investigation commission commented on Pelosij.
Kavanaugh denied the charges that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford was sexually assaulted when they were teenagers.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, at times almost inflamed, and was breathing during the discussion about his family and high school years.
He condemned the Democrats in the Commission and pointed out the charges against himself for the "great and coordinated muddy", which was organised by the liberals, in anger because Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 at the presidential elections.
Pelosijev said that he felt that Kavanaugh's testimony had proved that he should not be appointed a Supreme Judge, since he showed that he was biased to the Democrats.
"I believe that he discredited Clintons and Democrats with such statements and the way he fled," she said.
Pelosija is on the question of whether he will try to bring a constitutional charge against Kavanaugh if he is confirmed and democracy is given a majority in the House, for the moment.
“I will say so – if the Congress or the FBI does not speak the truth, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court but also for the court at which it is now,” Pelosijev said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosijev said that, as a democratic, Kavanaugh's decision against the Act on Access to Health Care or Roe's case against Wad is considered to be a conservative judge.
In its confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether to annul certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time to go hysterical, biased person to court and expect us to say, 'Is that not wonderful?'," Pelosij said.
And a woman's got to pick him up.
It's a fair outcome, after months and years of anger, and it can't express it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," she told me 45 years later.
"It doesn't seem rare to me, what do you think?"
She continued: “She was very helpful to me, a woman who was a director who was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique, which was when she got angry and started to cry, the person she was talking to said, ‘ Maybe I feel sorry for you because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
I thought it was great."
The tears are partly allowed as an exit to anger because people misunderstand them.
One of my strongest memories in my early career when I was still working in a office where men were in control, where I was once crying in unresolved anger, was an occasion when an elderly woman grabbed me at the door — a cold leader, who was always a few bullets that dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," she said.
"They won't understand that you're angry.
They will think you're sad, and they'll be happy to touch you."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was ambushed by a boat in a boat named Monkey Business and had to leave the game, Ms. Schroeder found that there was no reason why she could not run for the president alone.
“This was not a well thought-out decision,” she said 30 years later in a smile.
"There have been seven other candidates involved in the match and one more thing was needed at the time.
Someone called the match “Snegullica and seven thumbs” at that time.”
Since the campaign was last joined, she was lagging behind in collecting funds, so she decided that she would not join the game if she did not collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave the men $1,000, gave her only $250.
"Mar do they think I'm going to get a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced that she would not start the official campaign, her feelings of gratitude to the people who supported her, her discontent with the system, which made it so difficult to collect money and focus on voters instead of delegates, and her anger over sexism, were so overwhelming that she began to breathe.
“We would think I had a nervous breakdown,” said Schroederje’s reaction to the media.
"They'd think my official sponsor was Kleinex.
I remember thinking about what they were going to write on my graveyard.
“But was she crying?”
How could a war between the United States and China use Beijing?
The initial trade wars between the United States and China were listening, and although the battle has not yet been completed, experts say that the gap between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long term.
The US president, Donald Trump, initiated the first warning in the beginning of the year by taxation of key Chinese export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs for goods worth USD 200 billion ($150 billion), which effectively represents the taxation of half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has always been guilty of equivalent reimbursement measures, lastly with tariffs of between 5 and 10 per cent for US goods worth US$ 60 billion.
China, the second largest economy in the world, has committed itself to moving an eye for an eye from the United States and will probably not be involved soon.
In order for Washington to give up, China would have to comply with its demands, but the public removal of the United States would be too embarrassing for China's President Si Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing knows how to pull the right moves, US pressures in the trade war could have a long-term positive impact on China in order to reduce the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger economic turmoil in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have thought so far," said Abigail Grace, a professional collaborator focusing on Asia at the brain trust Center for New American Security.
Syria is “prepared” for the return of refugees, Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready to return refugees voluntarily, and asks for help in rebuilding the country, abandoned in more than seven years of war.
At the address of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said the country's situation is improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer because of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to repair areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal conditions.
Now all the conditions are met for the return of refugees who had to leave the country voluntarily because of terrorism and foreign economic measures aimed at their daily lives and survival.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Sircs have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The other six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome the help of the restoration of the desolated state.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries sponsoring the rebels.
Europe won a victory in Ryder's Battle in Paris
With a victory against the US team of 16,5 to 10,5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France won Ryder's Cup for 2018.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soils and Ryder's Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe once again won the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn team reached 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems through most of the championships, threw the ball into the water at the 16th hole in a couple-3 game at his initial hit, which was why he had to hand the game to Francesco Molinaria.
Italian golfers Molinari shined through all circles and became one of the four players, who have achieved a 5-0-0 score ever since the start of the championship in 1979.
American Jordan Speeth won the lowest-ranking player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark, with 5 and 4.
The world's best-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have played in Ryder's kiss the last time.
The veteran of the eight Ryder's podiums, Spanish Sergio Garcia, has become the most powerful European player of all time.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for raising me and believing me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy that we won the ball again.
It's a team and I'm really happy to be able to help," Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
The pen is handed over to John Rama, who won the American Gulf of Tiger Woods on Sunday with 2 and 1 in each game.
“I feel incredibly proud that I was able to beat Tiger Woods. When I grew up, I watched his games,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games he played in France, and now he has a career record in Ryderev held 13-21-3.
This is unusual statistics for one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 great titles right after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been trying hard all week to find the right path, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played golf at a high level all the time.
The U.S. captain said after a bad performance for his team, "I'm so proud of these guys, they fought."
In the morning, we pressed a few pressure on Europe for a moment.
We're down.
The club down before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're going to have to regroup, I'm going to work with the U.S.P.A. and our Ryder Room Committee, and we're going to move on.
I really like these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
Head down.
They have overpowered us."
