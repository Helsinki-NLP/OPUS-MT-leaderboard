Eighteen-year-old chef found dead in a shop in San Francisco
Eighteen-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was the stairs of local trade this week.
But the victim's brother says he doesn't think he's going to hurt him, and he says, "He finally started to do it."
The body found in Westfield Mall in the middle of the morning was identified as the 18-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia, a doctor's office.
The San Francisco Police Department has reported that it is a violent death and investigation.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia for the ABC KGO station in San Francisco said that Frank, who was a former chef in Boston, had his work as chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
Sons & Daughters said his death was "shocked and destroyed".
"We have a small team that works as a closely connected family. We will miss a lot," the speaker said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and concerns belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank had first slept in the living room, but that recently “he had finally begun to do so.”
"You found an apartment, you went with a girl," Louis Galicia said to the CEO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't think he'd want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to connect with his family, he always cooked food for us, made dinner for us," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to take part in any fights.
He was the brother who took things the way they were.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an unspoiled diamond that showed up every day," he said.

The Czech routes have invested over 31 billion vehicles in modernization.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, public transport has invested over 31 billion crowns to modernise vehicles.
A third of the vehicles are currently equipped with air conditioning, and about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, parts of modernization in each year with the exception of 2012 are gradually decreasing.
In the last six years, Czech routes have invested over 31 billion crowns to modernise vehicles.
A third of the vehicles are currently equipped with air conditioning, and about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The cash generated was shown to reduce average age by two years in locomotives and separate units and by six years in classic cars.
The larger part of the investment gave the transporter to regional transport, where about 60 per cent of the said money was directed, and 40 per cent of the company then invested in the refurbishment of vehicles for remote transport.
The average old locomotives and units currently reach 19 years.
Modernized older vehicles, however, are considered to be completely new in this indicator.
If the modernisation of vehicles were not calculated, the average age of CDC moving vehicles would increase by ten years.
Something older is on average a personal wagon, whose average age at the time of the upgrade is 23 years.
If only the age from the date of manufacture were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, the classic components consisting of cars and locomotives, in recent years, from the Czech and world railways, are gradually disembarked and replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotive from 280 to 223 pieces also dropped the number of classic cars from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
In particular, the carrier was free of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of locking the opening during the journey.
From January to July, the carrier let 110 of these vehicles crash.
For example, it is possible to introduce a purchase of 50 cars for speed up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier plans to place on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic high-speed routes.
The contract includes up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electrical units.
The authorities know about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can't get rid of it.
We're totally powerless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year online edition of Aktuálno.cz is watching the story of the billboard in the southern Czech Republic, which now attracts motorists to the visit of Lipna, where it is not only a touristic walk in the tree crowns, but also an Olympic park.
The road managers know they're right there, but they say they can't do anything about it.
Similar ads are hundreds throughout the country, perhaps thousands.
Officials say that there is a criminal law that makes it impossible for illegal mobile billboards to be removed immediately.
The need is in front of a complex bureaucratic wheel.
In the meantime, the company changes its name and the office is short on it.
Or it's enough to move the ad by a few meters and the official process has to start again.
The road and road directorate admitted that the main race from the Czech Budějovic to Lipno is standing on our ground at the state road advertising billboard closely.
Not three months, however, the officials were not allowed to remove the unauthorized portable structure with a huge insert board.
It's like nobody cares that they're standing right next to the car, in a 50-foot protective belt, where nothing can happen for safety.
Road managers say they can't just talk to billboards about the law.
You need to load it and drive it away.
"We must not allow that," says the spokesperson of the Directorate of Road and Road Nina Ledvinová and refers to a complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must pass by law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began online journal Aktuálno.cz to watch in detail in the spring, is not unique and shows a general problem that cannot be resolved effectively and quickly by the authorities.
In the South Czech Republic alone, the editors have counted dozens of similar mobile advertisements placed against the rules directly next to or near the vehicle.
So are other countries.
"We have difficulty in getting the companies to remove the passengers," confirmed the head of the Transport Committee of the Czech Buddhist Country Office Jiří Klas, whose colleagues share similar stories.
According to the Class, there is a law of the door that binds officials.
First of all, the owner of the billboard has to address in order to get the commercial out of the way.
Although bosses are often inconvenient or know the fenta, which has already been described in the past when the problem began to be more interesting: enough mobile stand with advertising to move about a few meters and the officials can put the previous call to the removal of the black fire in the trash.
That's because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard is.
"If someone moves her and coordinates disagree, she looks at it as a new device and we have to call the owners again," explains Jiří Klas.
The new law won't help.
The change could bring in a new law that would ban billboards from September next year at the highways and restrict them to Class I roads.
Critics point out that the rules for the pursuit of illegal and easily transferable advertising will remain the same today.
And it's not that bad for the authorities.
Companies can continue to make tens of millions of crowns each year on illegal land rentals, and no one can.
For example, the billboard on July belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials are well aware of it: the Czech Buddhist magistrate is currently conducting three administrative proceedings for the carefully built billboards.
The company is threatened by a trisectic fine in each case.
This is more of the ads that were placed without permission in the class I road safety belt.
The operation has not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, Head of the Committee on Transport of the Czech Buddhist Magistrate.
The ad, which is currently interested in.cz, although it is not yet listed among these cases, will soon come to it with the greatest probability.
According to the speaker, РSD Nina Ledvin’s company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will then be reached at the country table and then probably to the magistrates.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that can't be contacted.
He doesn't take the mail and the official seat on Zižkow was cancelled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company's company went to the South Korean businesswoman, Anton Fischer, who made a sharp argument with the head of the Czech representative Hyundai.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboard company rents and offers its premises to the auctioners, but in the past he has refused any connection.
However, this year in the spring, when RSD began to encourage Current.cz to be interested in advertising in Lipno, Fischer let state officials send a letter to the secret company Commerz Billboard in his pension, where he is allegedly a new company.
Even from this address, however, no one has called the road managers to date.
An empty fight.
Similar silence or opaque changes of seats are not uncommon.
One company, a couple of years ago, we gradually paid for two million crowns.
She just changed her name and ICHO and it wasn't a solution.
The executor's case came back, the commercials went on, maybe elsewhere.
We are quite powerless against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like a battle with windmills, admitting under the condition of keeping anonymity one of the officials.
The novel law in this regard has not been resolved yet.
Currently, several Members have spoken to the problem.
But they haven't done any activity yet.
On the contrary, Members who wanted to extend the term for the maintenance of billboards in the main Czech communications appeared.
The government has denied it.
Billboards are not only for national, but also for national and general policies very sensitive and some scissors.
On the one hand, they know about social demand after their restrictions, on the other hand, they themselves need to be put on fire in pre-election campaigns.
I don't stop that fairly well-established notion that if something doesn't work, you need to change the laws.
This year, farmers grow fewer crops, but more rapes and worms, estimate statistics.
According to the estimates of the Czech Statistical Office, the harvest of cereals this year will be 6.7 per cent lower than last year.
However, this year’s yield exceeds the average in the last five and ten years.
On the other hand, it's going to be higher than the drop of the rope (at 3.9 per cent) and the makeup (2.5 per cent).
The crop harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers raise 7.2 million tons of crops.
This results from the estimate that according to the status of 15 July published by the Czech Statistical Office.
The initial estimate was more pessimistic a month ago and predicted a ten-year decrease against the latrine.
The last harvest of cereals, however, was over-average.
This year's growth exceeds the average in the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, this year, it's gonna be the top of the rope and the mash.
Peanuts grow by 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they reached a peak of 1.256 million tons.
This year's crop may be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The expected decrease in the production of cereals is due both to a reduction in hectares of yield by 3.7 per cent to 5.71 tonnes of hectares, and to a reduction in the area of ostriches.
This year, farmers sold three percent less fields.
For the most important crop for the Czech Republic, the yield is 3,3 per cent lower this year, according to estimates.
Farmers put her on more fields.
However, a lower hectare yield will be signed at a decrease of 6.04 tonnes.
The five-year decrease in statistics is expected in barley barley, which is most commonly used for beer production.
The reduction in the yield is 15.2 per cent reduction, but also a lower hectare yield.
In contrast, icebergs are born at 6.3 percent more.
You'll also grow a harvest.
Statistics are estimated at 1,305 million tons, which is more against last year.
The ossuary area, however, expanded by 7.3 percent.
But the hectaric yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's yield of rape exceeds the ten-year average by 13.3 percent, and then it is planted on the surface of a third larger than ten years ago.
In the last four years, there's also a machete field.
This year, he was sent to 35,543 hectares by farmers.
By 2008, when the cat grew in the Czech Republic in the record 70,000 hectares, the field was half.
Thanks to the expansion of light areas, this year's harvest will be much richer.
It's going to rise against the front by 2.5 per cent to 27 423 tonnes.
Hectaric output is going to be 6.1 percent lower.
The Olympics accused two men of assault with knives and machetes, and the court sent them to jail.
The police accused two attackers who attacked a 15-year-old man with a knife and a cat in downtown Olomoce on Tuesday.
"Although he was trying to escape, he was subjected to severe and severe injuries, which he requested treatment at the hospital and other treatments," said police spokesman Marie Štrbáková.
Both of the apparent offenders were detained immediately after the attack.
The complainant filed a motion for a court to be taken into custody and the court declared him on Friday.
Both men are threatened by three to ten years in prison.
The police accused two detainees of assaulting a 15-year-old man in downtown Olomoce with knife and knife.
The attackers caused him severe and severe injuries, and the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people who became police officers on Tuesday on the right of the afternoon in the class of Freedom.
Pachatels ended up in custody, informing the Olomoucian police spokesman Marie Štrbákov.
The collective drive between the two families took place in the garden area in front of the Trattoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouce.
After an aggressive verbal attack, two attackers were attacked by a 15 - year - old man with a knife and a cat.
Although the attacked man tried to escape, he was subjected to severe and severe injuries, which he requested treatment at the hospital and other treatments, the police spokesperson told him.
At a rally that aroused a lot of attention in the city center and that had to involve several police guards and guards at the site, there was a family dispute.
The criminals of a forty-year-old man from Slovakia and a seventy-year-old man from Olomouce have been accused of trying to cause serious damage to health and expropriation.
The complainant filed a motion for a court to be taken into custody, and the court declared him on Friday, added the speaker.
At the center of Olomouce, the attacker was also used by the attackers five years ago, and only a few tens of meters later, before the Varna discotheque in Riegro Street.
The police then said that a group of about ten foreigners with weapons attacked the company's guests who were standing in front of the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, holes and cats in their hands.
The court then punished two attackers with a sentence.
Left and empty houses in central Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you walk around them every day.
One of the most striking examples of an unused and empty house is the extensive construction of the former IPB settlement in the middle of the Señorje Square.
She was supposed to work as a hotel a long time ago.
But there's still nothing.
Is there a need to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what about the use of existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the centre of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Václavje Square are several festive houses, which, despite their location, size and often even memory protection, are empty and empty.
We have selected real estate in the centre using the project Pázdnédomy.cz, which maps the long-term empty property in the territory of the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of the financial problems of their owners, of non-transparent relationships between companies or belong to a state that does not know or wants to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Let the owners pay a special tax, wants an initiative

Clinton's husband made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to publish his tax admissions.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, president Bill Clinton made $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars spent on Clinton's charity.
Most of Clinton's revenue -- over six million dollars -- is due to their expressions.
Trump refuses to publish his tax confession.
The candidate of American Democrats to President Hillary Clinton published his tax returns on Friday, raising pressure on his Republican rival, Donald Trump, to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, announced the AP.
Most of Clinton's revenues - over six million dollars - are for their performances, mostly from the period before April 2015 when Clinton began his campaign before the elections.
The tax report showed that Clinton's husband had a federal income tax of 34.2 per cent last year and then a government and local income tax of 9 per cent.
So they paid 43.2 percent of their income.
But Trump has a similar problem, so far he has not decided to publish tax admission.
It's possible that Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, she wrote Clinton on the Twitter a few minutes after publishing her confession.
Clinton repeatedly returns to the secret of Trump's income, including to raise doubts as to whether her rival is really as rich as he claims, the AP agency has introduced.
The trumpet's worth of money is estimated at billions of dollars.
A lower benefit would damage the reputation of the Republican candidate as a successful entrepreneur.
Senator Tim Kaine, who, in tandem with the former first lady, has been running for the post of vice president, today published a report on his tax deductions in the last ten years.
Together with his wife, Anne Holton, they paid 7.5 percent of their Charity and paid 25.6 percent of their profits last year.
In Nigeria, she broke up again.
The Islamics from Boko Haram defended the subsequent beating and the doctors killed.
In Nigeria, there were cases of child assaults again.
In the northeastern part of the country, the government expressed extraordinary expectations because two children were protected from this disease.
Vaccines were carried there by helicopters.
In the affected area, Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram, who defended the occult and even killed the doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was undetected there.
In the northern part of Nigeria, the children’s emergency puppies begin to attack because there were two children who were infected with this disease.
In Africa, the virus was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government announced that in the state of Borno there would be millions of children and four million more in the surrounding countries.
Nigerian military helicopters arrived on Friday, according to the AP agency, quickly transported vaccines against children's defences to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram act.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the virus has been undetected for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram in the past have defended the fatherhood and even killed the doctors.
Their attacks also made it impossible for doctors to reach areas where children were found with a gun on Thursday.
Both of the affected battalions came from refugees in Nigeria recently freed from Boko Haram.
The head of the WHO division responsible for the release of the Michel Zaffran Defence Station told the BBC that Fathering in Nigeria will begin next week.
In the state of Borna, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram has been active for a long time.
The area was made available by international organizations and governments until the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram was able to weaken in this part of the country in a fundamental way.
The Nigerian Minister of Health Isaac Adevole admitted that the new defence cases were a major disappointment to the country because Nigeria wanted to declare next year that the defence had been invented in it.
WHO warned that it is possible that although the disease has not appeared for two years, it has spread among children.
They're gonna be buried now, kids under the age of five.
In 2012, Nigeria was one and a half of the world’s defence cases.
While it was still in 125 countries in 1988, it is now only in three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the moving stories of fallen women.
Pope František met with twenty former prostitutes who, thanks to the police, had escaped from the gang of passports.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look to the future with confidence.
František wanted to draw attention to this meeting and to call for a stronger fight against it.
Pope František met with twenty former prostitutes in Rome who were released by the police from the power of a gang of passports.
The head of the Catholic Church listened for more than an hour to the moving stories of fallen women and then urged them to look to the future with confidence, introducing the Vatican spokesman.
Among the former prostitutes that František visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age moves around 30.
According to the Vatican, all were exposed to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution.
At the visit, František wanted to focus on dealing with people and to call for a stronger fight against them, he introduced the pope’s spokesman.
František often points to the fate of people on the edge of society.
For example, on Thursday, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this April and in June thanks to his personal invitation.
France's gonna hit the made-up jihadists.
But without the help of Muslims, it won't work.
France is fighting radical Islam, helping Muslims themselves.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Valles intends to make fundamental changes in the functioning of mixed and spiritual education.
Since last December, we have closed 20 blends and prayer.
And the others will follow, the Minister of the Interior announced.
There's over a hundred Jedi manufacturers in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this recognition of freedom," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
In particular, it is intended to ensure that only the persons who have been educated in France are taught in the mosques and prayers.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding mixing abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from abroad to build new blends, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the Persian Gulf.
And that's why they get to mix, the ministers who can spread radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the Prime Minister added.
The key that will ensure his achievement of these goals will be the new French Islamic hope.
It should function as a bridge between a secular state and a Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
In the country, the French Foundation for Islam, which was established by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
By then, donations had contributed to a review of the financial flows between the mixed and the countries that financed their construction.
But the institutions soon struck internal disputes and rivalries.
"It's a total failure," Valls said recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, the debate on a new institution was heated, which will replace the non-functional reward.
All have stepped up further terrorist attacks in France, which on behalf of the Islamic State have carried out radicalised Islamists.
The French Minister of Interior Bernard Cazeneuve recently heard that a new donation would be made this October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mixed household resources and also to look after the images.
Meanwhile, it is not clear where it will take money not only to build new blends, but also various educational centers.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or food tax.
In practice, the sellers would pay for the food, which is for the certification.
Some of this money would then travel right into the money money.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros (270 to 540 kroner) could then be paid by French passengers who are released to Mecca.
Every year they go there for a traditional tour to Saudi Arabia about 30,000.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, only teachers who have undergone special education programmes at French universities should be involved in the mix in the future.
This should ensure that the preaching is in line with democracy.
We'll close the radical mix.
At the same time, the French government is complaining against radicals.
And the others will follow, the Minister has announced recently inside.
In France, there is no place for those who declare hatred and respect for certain principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
In the country, it is estimated that some 2,500 mixes and prays.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islam.
Since 2012, the authorities have made up about 80 species and several more decades have considered this.
But not all think that the steps of the government can significantly affect radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize themselves will do the same.
There is no such thing in the pockets, young people are radicalizing themselves on the Internet, Severine Labatová, an expert from the National Research Centre.
Driver Kelemen lost in the 1st round of sprint with the Baugem star.
The procedure for the eight-wheel drive must be carried out by the Czech roadcyclist in the correct driving.
The career cyclist Pavel Kelemen in the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, after the qualification of the sprint among the best eighteen, lost in the 1st round a match with the French giant Gregor Baugum, a silver defender of the past games in London.
The eight-point procedure must be killed in the right-hand drive.
At the start of the royal discipline on the road, 27 riders were built and the best Czech driver at the moment signed up for the fourteenth best time.
The two-year-old starter arrived in 9,969 seconds.
In the main extraction phase, he was expected to be qualified by the fifth Baugé, who already has the bronze in the team sprint from Rio.
Kelemen finally reached out to experienced French, but he took a look at the procedure.
With a great performance, Jason Kenny's gold shield was shining.
Eighteen-year-old Brit took the third fastest double of history and qualified in the Olympic record 9,551.

There was also a British quartet in Bradley Wiggins, which included a new world record of 3:50,570 in the race for 4 km and entered the final.
The daily peak (3:51,659), which the British had four years since the London Olympics, improved by more than a second.
Young Doctors Press: Wanting a Fresh Wind in the Field
Representatives of young doctors met to approve new steps in their dispute over a new contract.
The Council of Young Doctors (JDC) in the British Medical Association (BMA) must request the full advice to support further sectoral actions early in September.
JDC says the ministers were unable to resolve the treaty issues.
Young doctors and medical students in July voted against the agreement agreed with BMA.
58% of its members who participated in the elections were rejected.
In a letter to the members published on Thursday night on Twitter, President JDC Ellen McCourt stated that the government remained "still calm" on issues, which led to the rejection of the contract.
She said: “In this light, the JDC-led body decided by voting to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to request a new formal procedure in all matters.”
In response to the government's silence, the JDC formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve the ongoing programme of accelerated sectoral actions early in September.
The dispute led young doctors this year to a six-story event, including the first general event in the history of NHS.
The leader of young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malavan, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
BMA members at the pre-voting meetings with 54,000 young doctors and medical students said that the agreement was good and should be adopted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said the contract would mean a burden for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Inseparable" Associations?
It was the gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to lay their hands and announce the formal end of eight months of long verbal wars and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish opposition to the overcrowded palace in Petrohrada, I felt that Ankara wanted more after this reconciliation.
It came to hand in hand, yes.
But Putin didn't smile, and she barely fancied the heat, even according to his standard.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke about his " dear friend" to Mr Putin - five times, as one of the reports says.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their level before the crisis, but they would be even better.
The next day one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan was acting like nothing bad ever happened.
According to his enthusiasm, he showed the exact opposite.
But the constant cold that he was shining out of Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement: Shooting a Russian warplane Turkish on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction back then was devastating.
Putin gave wounds to himself and Ankara accused Moscow of killing a knife in the back.
The humiliation was greater than it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media carried out a massive global campaign against Ankara a month later.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks could do everything.
It was more serious to blame the top state officials for the fact that Erdogan's own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
This guy's been very hard on this.
But there's an official message in Petrograd that it's time to move on.
The end of this meeting was only because Putin had an apology he had requested from President Erdogan.
Russia could also declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of the declaration are quite clear.
In the first row, Erdogan was almost powerless last month during an unscrupulous storm and therefore needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey are also visible to him.
There's also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have had a hard impact - especially the cancellation of charter flights, which transport several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast each year.
This figure was reduced by almost 90 %.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will breathe here when the flight renewal occurs.
They earn on Mediterranean travel at the end of the season.
Even this week, the state television promised cheaper fruit and vegetables when the imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey were again allowed.
"Tourists there, paradise back here," as the news reported in the Vedemas newspaper.
The visit, however, had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry to the West for what it considers to be a fault reaction to a reversing attempt.
In addition, the long-lasting irrevocability of long-term EU accession talks and Putina's entry - which is aimed at making use of cooling and cutting off Turkey's Gulf to the West.
The Russian leader certainly won the bonus points when Ankara asked for the help of the elected authorities after attempting to break it.
You must understand that for Moscow, which is deeply rooted in fear of changing the regime, it is given.
So the summit in this spring, the Baltic Sea Palace of Russia and Turkey made it possible to bring forward what one analyst described to me as the "community of incompatibilities": how they connect the forces of two countries that feel rejected and used by the West.
Despite the fact that public reconciliation has been shown, there are fundamental differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently became a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey stand on the opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three-hour opening talks, both presidents at the press conference stated that they had not even mentioned the issue.
The Turkish President deliberately answered the question of differences between them, while Putin decided to raise these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both States could find a common word on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and in view of the risk of a complete disaster, when a member of NATO has shot down the Russian warplane - it is certainly better that both leaders speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS mark should be pressed into the role of the back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected to the global ambitions of the bank.
She got out of them when she almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be bought out of debt.
At that time, the strategic brands were used by RBS to protect other brands of consumer finance.
It was followed by millions of pounds spent on sponsoring international sports, from the football championship Six Nations after the winbled andy Marraye champion.
Now, however, it has been decided that it is better to make more of the national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not start a new business.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of the center and the stock coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
For customers in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland, the mark Ulster Bank is already used.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more in advance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During the trip to customers and employees in the Inverness-shire, McEwan answered our questions, Ross McEwan.
The BBC Scotland Station said: "The RBS seal will cease to be our investor's mark and mark for which our employees are working, because we are now becoming more and more a brand bank."
Because the bank itself became a global brand, it became a global brand and RBS.
Now I'm saying we don't have global aspirations anymore, we're doing our homework.
Each of these marks will mean something completely different in their own communities and our workers will work under these marks.
The RBS has already stated that it will not continue in its sponsorship of the Six Nations champion, prepared a profile of individual sports sponsorship brands.
"It has been a good time for us to move to a brand bank, because the basic question (which we are asking) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?" the executive director said.
Three years ago, it would be very cynical if we said that we would become a great bank for customers and the brands.
But together with how we focused on customer needs, not on our own, I think there's a lot of change.
We can mention these marks again, I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on the horse Predilection led to the goal 3000. winner
Dettori sprays champagne after a double victory in Newmarket brought him 3,000 wins
Jack Frankie Dettori won 3,000 wins in Britain on Friday in New Market.
This lover achieved his second victory in the evening on his local track - on the horse Predilection, which John Gosden is training.
Ital is a six - year - old hooker who has achieved such a result in equal pay.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-way champion of Dettori, who previously won the Ghayyar horse, said, "It's strange."
I'm very curious because my family is here, too.
I'm so glad it happened in New Market, because I was stuck here 30 years ago.
It's not a great event, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on the ground with 20,000 people.
I got better, and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when he brings Predilection after victory
Two of these athletes achieved this milestone in obstacles – a Richard Johnson ball champion and a 20-year-old champion on the board Sir Anthony McCoy, who led more than 4,300 winners during his careers in recording records.
Lester Piggott, 9th winner Derby, 4 493 winners in the career
Frankie is one of the best jocks of modern times, and it's not surprising that he's reached a milestone that only a few riders have achieved before him.
He's stylish and strong, but it's just his tactical fistron that distinguishes him from the other riders in the weight.
He is a fantastic ambassador of achievements, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he didn't just go out on weekends and big hits, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
Of course, it's true that Frankie was driving a winner in Britain for most of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He's alive, which is good for British sports, but more importantly, he's an incredible hooker.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous summer shock
From the summer finish after the summer break - Frankie Dettori was a two-decade of British balancing achievements.
It was like a ride on the mountain road.
Unprecedented number of winners of major races, including his famous "major sevens" in Ascot. He also survived the plane crash and had a ban on the launch of drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned after 6 months' ban, he showed incredible inner strength and returned to all doubters in the best form.
And maybe it won't last - Dettori already announced that he would like to continue in the race for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin missed President Sergei Ivanov's chief office
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanov from the post of chief president of the office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of the closest Putin co-workers after many years.
Ivanov was appointed a special representative of the environment and transport for thirty years.
The Kremlin declaration states that Putin “has released Ivanov from his services to the head of the Russian presidential office”, but there was no reason.
His place will be taken over by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's representative since 2012.
Forty-four years old Warden was a diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, promoted at the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the website (in Russian) it is stated that he was later the head of the presidential protocol and the president's office.
When he called Putin, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your head-of-state activities in terms of the draft laws and control of the extent to which your guidelines are being complied with.
Putin said on Friday that Ivanov had asked her to be released from the post and recommended that he replace her just Military.
Can you believe the smiles?
This step was totally mystical to Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has been one of the closest collaborators of Vladimir Putin for a long time and as well as Putin has been working for the KGB.
As chief of the president's office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who broadcasts state television, both men declared that the head of the president's office is on his own request.
But the smiles to the cameras have convinced only a few people - especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So this is the result of a fight of power?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man who was once considered as a possible president wants to lead the environmental policy of Russia at once met with great distrust.
On Kremlu’s pages are quoted as referring to Putin, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you in the interview to give me this very demanding post, even to say a problematic post, he spent four years.
Looks like I've been the head of the president's office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov was arrested in December 2011.
Formerly, he served as vice-president of the government and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and has previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin served the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his representative.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of his closest five collaborators.
It was even speculated that Ivanov could become the successor of Putin in front of the State after his second election period because the third period would be anti-constitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken over by another close associate of Putin's co-worker Dmitry Medvedev.
The trip was just three and a half years later, before returning to the presidential office, he became prime minister.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the crime thought series, was released after the director's hit.
Gibson was involved in the physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The TV stations ABC and CBS, which produce the series, have announced their release in a joint declaration.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before announcing his release.
There have been creative differences on stage and accidents.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in a statement.
According to TV stations ABC and CBS, details about how Gibson's status disappears from the series that follows the stories of the FBI team's agents later.
A 14-year-old actor, whose main role in the Dharma and Greg site, has been in the series since the first series in 2005.
"I love the thoughts of criminals and have given them hearts and souls over the past 12 years," Gibson stated in his statement on Friday.
I was hoping I'd be in it by the end, but it won't be possible right now.
I would still like to express my thanks to the authors, the producers, the actors, our wonderful team and, above all, to the great fans in which this show could have hoped.
Returning the series to the 12th series is expected on September 28.
In the city of Banff secretly landed in a fish garden
A man from Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish can be sandstorms that left water.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published a short film of his findings on Periscope's canal in the belief that someone could help him explain how about 5 centimeters of fish were caught in his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connects with Fife
The project for 1.35 billion liberra is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the northern plane and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - the bridge now connects with Fife.
So it's the first of four closures between the "breaths" that are now almost finished around each of the three bridges.
The part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
There are 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 suspended wires.
The project is to be completed by May 2017 for a total of 1.35 billion pounds.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the fortress on the bridge.
He said: “This is the historic moment and the symbolic moment of Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we all witness how construction engineers actually used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, the conclusion between the viaduct and the surface of the bridge was a delicate operation that required extraordinary accuracy.
In its place there is now a total of more than 79 % of the total surface of the bridge, concrete for the last part of the surface is now drifting away in Rosyth, so the whole area is ready to rise to the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager of Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure in building each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this conclusion represents the tip of the earthly structure.
After installation of the last part of the road surface and its connection to the expanding North Tower surface, we had to close the last space on the north side - towards the mainland.
We've done this by extending the northern approximate route 700 millimetres south.
This was massive and at the same time very delicate.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and it was necessary to stretch it with a climb of about 3 %.
It's delicate because the tolerances he worked with were very small - just a few millimeters each way.
Everything went very well.
Saved in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy to be alive"
Three men are "lucky that they are alive" after the water from their fishing boat to England bursts.
The rescue ship station Moelfre RNLI announced a strike on Friday at 13:20 British summer time after the crew saw an incident in the Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim safely, while their boats continued unscathed.
"We saw their boat circling in their vicinity and we felt the worst," said the rescue ship's rider Moelfre Vince Jones.
"The strong wind took her luck away from them even before we left," he added.
Two men saved the local fishing boat, the third man at 60 years of age was found without a life jacket worn out, holding the battles.
All were transferred on board the coastal rescue ship and transferred back to the rescue ship station
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water are happy that they are alive and completely unharmed.
The ship's engine had a rope for emergency shutdown, but somehow it got disconnected from the person who drove the boat when it came back.
Someone was holding a protective hand over those geese.
The judge refuses to deal with the case because of the Tulcho woman.
Petr Tluchoř is one of the three Members who, according to the complaint, were to be received from Prime Minister Nezepa and his then head of the Janya Nagy's political traffic office, which is the lucrative post for political intervention.
The tax package was approved in 2012.
Schnydr, Fuksa and Tluchoř made it possible by their resignations.
Then they showed up at influential positions in state companies.
And that's why they also faced a charge suspicion and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, it was not justified, and so compensation was paid to nearly 2 million crowns.
The fat person is now in charge as a witness, and this is after the Supreme Court's intervention.
His wife works in the fruit market court and deals with civil disputes.
However, he wants to be the Judge of the King (refers to criminal matters - see Reg.) and to avoid possible objections.
The case is likely to bring another Prague court district to the fore.
The Queen then released the guilt of Janu Neczeiro twice, before Nagy.
It was a alleged abuse of military intelligence to monitor the first wife of Prime Minister Nekze Radka.
In this case, Tluchoř did not appear.
According to Lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, however, it is an overreached reaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be so ruled out as to rule out whether witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid then there's nothing to judge, not to mention the diary.
"I think it's crazy," he added.
In the case of political traffic, Roman Boček, former official, is also accused.
According to his lawyer, Peter Toman, however, a possible objection would have a chance of success.
The District Court for Prague 1 filed a complaint on 13 June by a former chief of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petra Nekzeme Janny Nagyov (Today of the Untimely) and other accused of abuse of military intelligence.
There's an Untimer with his husband in court.
The fat guy was supposed to make decisions about Peruutkov.
For example, the wife of the exhibition was to judge President Milos Zeman's sentences on the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutkovi.
Zeman said he was sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolboys is already dead!
The girl must have died in the plane crash of the joint forces.
In Syria, along with her two old girlfriends, she flew out of the London Gatwick airport last February.
The British Ministry has not commented on her death report.
Young Londoners who fled their homes were secretly transferred to Syria across the Turkish border, according to the police.
Shamima Begumová, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana have been targeted by the media for their other former partner from the London school of the Bethnal Green Academy.
Last year, the case caused a huge wave of attention and tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security records estimate that some 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria, including about 50 young women and girls.
A number of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home are a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for hundreds of dollars.
Great payroll work you don't even need a high school for.
That's how it looks at the first view of the work of an anaconda.
And often the other one.
The benefit is not only extremely high pay in Czech terms (in Prague you will earn up to 180,000 Kč), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge lack of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
According to estimates, nearly 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
Among the most sought-after are personal agencies of Grafton programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists, according to statistics.
Candidates can choose between a few job offers.
The candidates do not agree on the job position, but the job position on the candidates, comments Jitka Souková, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
High school is not necessary.
Higher education, however, is not necessary for orphans.
Higher education means a good foundation and is an overall indicator of the intelligence and education of the candidate, but it does not often have much in common knowledge of development.
Developers must constantly learn new things, which once studied high school does not make up, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
He's making the most of it in Prague.
In spite of the fact that the natives are moving high above the Republic averages everywhere.
For the most money they'll come to Prague and Brno, there's no such a hit parade in the regions.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kubačka confirms.
Technical directors will reach the highest level.
In Prague and Brno, they can reach 120 000 - 180 000 CZK.
In other regions, payment is lower, but it does not fall below 80,000 CZK.
Demands are also IT project managers.
They can earn 60,000 - 100,000 CZK in the event.
It's a fight about graduation.
While in some professions, graduates often have to go straight to the office of work, they don't pay for it.
If companies are to transfer and transfer an expert from another company, they will be happy to apply for the graduate.
They can raise him according to their own.
They won't get away with it without their tongue.
The knowledge of a foreign language is appropriate in every profession, but a minimum decent English is required for the natives.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is necessary in some IT positions.
On the other hand, we meet with a number of cases where companies are looking for a highly educated and experienced person in particular and are satisfied with only the average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker has more foreign words, it is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, the director of Cuba will deliver.
Yoóo in Google, there's a paradise.
It's easy to envy a regular employee in Google.
Of course, it is a flexible working time for them, a job opportunity from home or a variety of short notices, not just for mothers.
"The newly sealed fathers are also provided with four weeks of vacation after the birth of a child," says Martina Jonekova, a spokesperson for Google.
Hitchhiking also carries health care for employees and families, feeding, transportation, training, wellness or massage directly at the workplace.
Whoever wants to learn is green and doesn't depend on what new one wants to learn.
But the benefits don't end.
Such a full refrigerator for free is certainly not for disposal.
A healthy meal (in some places and breakfasts and dinners) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called microwaves in every office, where people always find a healthy dish, they see a speaker.
And so that nothing could be thrown out, so what's going on, it goes into a box that employees can take home tonight.
And the reason for the Czech situation of incredible benefits?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"For Google, it is not important for employees to sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, movement or development, ideas and innovative solutions," the speaker added.
The United Nations strongly criticised Bulgaria for the criminalisation of refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussain, United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria of systematically violating human rights as refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "calls serious concern that Bulgaria does not respect international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussain warned in a statement.
He pointed out that "it is particularly worrying to be a witness of how important and influential public personalities express public support for criminal armed fighters, who run the race for refugees at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey".
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross Bulgarian territory are automatically arrested," Zeid stressed.
And what is worse, they are often imprisoned and imprisoned for a year or longer, if they try to leave the land.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone is entitled under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria held 14,000 migrants this year, last year for the same period of 21,000.
Pokémon Go - Honba for health and happiness that will be paid
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
During the last decade, many people complain that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer spending free time in front of the screens.
Pokémon brings people out of custody and leads them to activity.
Time spent in front of the screens was originally starved on TV, later on video games and more recently on smart phones.
It's great to see that technologies and activities outside are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I'm talking about fashion, which is Pokémon Go, application based on items that first appeared in video games at the end of the 1990s (later created drawn series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, this new game has been introduced in the beginning of July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand to a decline in interest.
The introduction in other countries was then postponed because of the potential interest that led to server overload.
Pokémon Go won over several days more users than Tinder and almost as many users as he has on Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players on the smart phone go out looking for the Pokémons who follow them using GPS, and when they find them, they can "draw" them (through the screenshot on the phone) or "get them".
Mania praised the generation who, at the younger age of playing the game, took her out of the chair and the woman out looking for Pokémony.
In the United States, this game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps that "average" people make every day.
The Cardiogram app for smart hours from Apple, who is watching 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that during two days of playing the game, the number of people who attended every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who plays Pokémon - it sees only rough data about level exercises.
Many public campaigns aimed at finding 30 people, "getting up from the couch" and "were active every day" fell on an unusual ground, because most public-health messages are boring and targeted by people who don't look good.
However, the importance of training must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we can't provide here.
But the beauty of the game Pokémon sleeps in the fact that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover three health pillars - movement, fresh air and sun peppers.
Some people even get new friends when they're horrified.
As it is, they will, of course, find such boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can enter the door.
What about, like?
It's a breakthrough.
In their time applications for smart phones, like Fitbit, were able to watch our activity, but they didn't give us any reason to do something like this game.
The news is taking a look and the interest in it is beginning to fall at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémons, there will be other games that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help a number of people in the pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles won gold in a multi-fighting gymnast of women
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Billes is immune to all this.
Dynamic to jump.
Without a tent on the floor.
All of them in the open.
Excellent in everything.
And now finally the Olympic champion.
The 90-year-old American gymnast went straight on Thursday with a title in a multi-fight and the others on the full line under the Olympic reflectors.
The overall result of 62,198 clearly confirmed its progress towards silver medalist and member of the "final five" team Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliy Mustafin.
Simone Bilesová (USA) on Thursday during the event at the camp in the finals of several players in the sports gymnast at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in brazilian Rio de Janeiro.
Billes became the fourth American in a series that won the most, and the fifth in total, when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps even the best.
When her overall final assessment was on the table and her long journey to this point ended, she was shown on the face of tears.
This success results in the same league of single athletes of their time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Billes's sport has dominated for the last three years, won 15 medals in world championships - including 10 gold. Her fascinating compositions are a mixture of ambition and precision and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton marked her as "the best gymnast she ever saw."
The final test was waiting for her in Brazil, not just between Billes and the rest of the race, but between her own and the burden of too great expectations.
Anything other than returning home to your family in Spring, Texas, with a hand full of gold medals, would be perceived as a disappointment.
Simone Bilesová (USA), left, and Aly Raisman embrace gold and silver medals in the finals of the women's multi-faceted Summer Olympic Games 2016 in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The first Biles won Tuesday, when she was as an interpreter in the event of Martha Karolyi's national team coordinator.
Billes insists that she never looked forward to her long journey to the summit, but it is not entirely true.
Part of her composition in the free rooms - the one that contains her typical triple salt with a double twist - is planted in Latin music that would just go home to the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her cousins as a battalion, and her talent was discovered by the mother of Coach Aimee Boorman's way to the gym where Boorman trained and won.
The competition has not won since 2013 - this is the result of a victory that can continue as long as Biles will want.
Even though Mustafin took a short lead on two islands, it was just an illusion.
Kladina and the simple - where Billes defends the world championship - wait.
She got back to the front with 15,433 points behind the deck - and ended with 15,933 points in the free.
Raisman kindly hugged her while waiting for the final score - just formality - and about three-and-a-half-red, white and blue shadows came out of Billes' tears when the wish that she had ever written down as a child was fulfilled.
Raisman's performance was so little payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared a third match with Mustafin, but then bronze for her three best compositions.
This time, the twenty-first-year-old captain of the team, who the Americans call "baby", was quite ahead.
After her release, she sent a gift of air kisses, and she was defeated by a return that seemed to be inexhaustible at times.
For Billes, this nine-year-old athlete has put on Twitter this week, where he became a complete hit, a whole new issue:
Police: Three victims in the case of a serial killer shot while listening to music in the car
According to the police report published Thursday, two women and a girl died at the age of 12 during the most serious attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in the car, talking and listening to music.
The authorities announced that Angela Rochelle Linerová, Stefanie R. Ellisová and the daughter of Ellis Maleah were shot on June 12 in a car parked on the road.
The report states that the armed man stood on the side of the driver and fired eight wounds from the handgun. Then he ran into another vehicle.
According to the police, there is no three-way robbery because the attacker did not take the money, nor the amount of $2,900 that one of his adult victims had.
Speaking police in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the investigators were investigating whether the shooting had any connection with any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Spanish quarters, a total of nine attacks occurred in four months, with seven people killed and two others injured.
"It's happening in the villa neighborhood in front of the houses," Howard introduced this month for the KHO branch of the CBS station.
Police believe that the suspect used several cars, including Nissan's lamb at the end of the 1990s, the black BMW at the end of the 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to explain what evidence led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was transferred to a hospital where she later suffered from her injury.
Linear (31) and daughter of Ellis Maleah died on site.
A police witness said it wasn't unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which became the target of an empty delivery only half an hour before a triple murder, and the police believe its source was this serial killer.
The investigators found the cartridges and made a bullet from the rest of the balls in the seat and from under the hoods of the engine.
The mother of a six-year-old child with a microcephalus: "His condition is improving"
Edmund Picciuto, like most children of his age, loves songs, toys, and of course also his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers microcephalus, which is the result of a genetic disorder his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, I thought I couldn't handle this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - obviously you are preparing for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, learned that Edmund might never be known and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in the institution.
"My first reaction was that I thought people didn't do this anymore," Picciut explains.
Edmund's walking with a walker.
He shouldn't have sat down until he was three years old, and he's still not talking.
Some borders are already filling in slowly.
He's walking with help and driving around.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth utters a sign saying that Edmund says, "Please sing to me."
"We teach him the sign word," Picciutová told CBS News.
But it's not the usual sign word - says Edmund invented some sign himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different states: genetics, such as Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused viruses such as sleepwalkers or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary significantly.
It's too soon for us to say what impact Zika will have on the lives of the infected.
Picciut recalls a tax that does not choose the future.
I keep asking, "What's going to happen?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
I've never really wondered what a total prediction is, because I don't expect anyone to tell me.
Picciutová, however, has an encouraging report for the mothers of all children who suffer from birth defects caused by Zika.
The situation is getting better.
You know it's gonna be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods have requested rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
A strong rain and extensive floods in Louisiana led the governor to declare a state emergency on Friday. Another rain is expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) reported that after extreme flooding, a number of rivers in the south-east Louisiana and southern Mississippi will flow from their shores and threaten extensive flooding.
Governor Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on their way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokesperson of the governor for national security and preparedness for the crisis, said that they are receiving requests for vehicles to drive in the water, boats and sand.
Steele said that only the county of Tangipahoe asked for ten thousand pints of sand.
The flood guards will remain in most of the southern Louisianas working on Saturday.
The Meteorological Service stated in the declaration that it could sink more than 8 to 13 centimeters above the sea.
In southern Alabama, there was a flood guard on Friday, when the rains continued in the area of the city of Mobile.
According to predictions, the Committees at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs have the weekend to culminate.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said that both said they could swim a number of houses in the rural areas of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that there is a danger of flooding after a current in the Ascension County, when these depleted streams will be flown to Lake Maurepas only slowly.
Tickfaw said that something more south of the Mississippi state border in Louisiana, reached the local time on Friday at 9 a.m. at the highest recorded level.
Rescuers are still raising people from the coastal waters of Amite and Wilkinson in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his own son were among the Gloster survivors before Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 metres from his home, had risen quickly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his next non-own son who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was getting closer," said Hansford.
We had her in the belt.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever experienced on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all of his family were injured and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford stated that crisis workers saved all three huge military-style trucks and transferred them to a fire station in Gloster, where they were hidden on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continuation of the rainy rains, the floods “widen quickly” and the authorities consider evacuation.
According to Krautmann, the observer near Livinston announced that from midnight till Friday to early morning, the rains fell 35 centimeters [35 cm].
Krautmann said that the ground was very busy from mid to mid to mid.
The authorities have indicated that the efficient rain and paid roads have requested the rescue of residents from their homes during the period of Tangipahoe and the abolition of education in five school districts.
The WWL branch of CBS reported that 200 homes were flooded according to Tangipahoe’s elders.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
The mayor of the village of Robby Miller stated that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals that had been trapped by high water.
In the village of Amit and in the city of Hammond there were shelters for those who were evacuated.
"They will be able to return home when the water starts to fall," he said.
In the county of Tangipahoa in Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed because of the flood, and the locals were given a sand bag that they could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from the water.
"The last big floods we had here in March," said the city manager Lacy Landrum.
It seems these floods will be similar.
Rupert Lacy, a crisis manager in Harrison County, Mississippi, stated that on the Persian Gulf coast, persistent rains continue.
He said that a few homes had been burned on Thursday, but none of them had been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the field for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "a boy shot in the face", survived a shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, six-footed boys were shot in Philadelphia, and this week they're already shooting a second child at 6 years of age in the city.
Her child's parents identified her for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaje Brown.
The parents say that the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including weakness, leg, leg and abdomen, but when he was taken to the hospital, he was conscious.
"He grasped this awfully much, his small body was scattered as it was resolved," said his grandmother, Delores Melendez.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family for the station said the boy should get well.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three more men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men 29 years old is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, there are two other victims in stabilised condition.
According to the report, a child was found shot on the front seat of the vehicle with a critical 20-year-old man.
Two other victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be a shooter.
The investigators at CBS Philadelphia indicated that there was likely a shooter between several armed men.
The site has been found with a weapon of a type of attack, which belongs to a variety of weapons of attack.
According to everything, it was definitely a continuing battle.
On the street there were banners on both sides of the sidewalk.
It seems, then, that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved here," the captain of the Philadelphia police station, Anthony Ginaldi, told the station.
Several homes and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No one's been detained, and the police are allegedly investigating video recordings from the camera.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot into a wildfire on Tuesday in front of a house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
The girl's back, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's just how I imagine a female gymnastic team for this year's Olympics, right for a few reasons.
First of all, I've been on every summer Olympic since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, in this team are three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which complements Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also confirmed the presence of blacks and Latin Americans on the tip of this sport.
A gymnasium number one in the past four years was an African American.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second points last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals suddenly became a champion of the Olympics and America was riding.
Now the world could be witness to the incredible performance of three-way world winners Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who performed unexpected but masterly gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to receive gold in a woman’s more individual battle.
And team member Aly Raisman won the silver.
We're witnesses to the gymnastics summit, but it doesn't look that way in the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie graduated from the Olympic team the same way as Aly and Madison.
They are "final five", because the team will only consist of four athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi is training.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is financially demanding sports and gymnastics are mainly trained in private gymnastics clubs that keep parents paying for training, equipment, travel, clothes, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their believers and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs the gymnasts have all the training and for the gymnastics and gymnastics families are a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they started high school.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics training that is more accessible and accessible to the countless communities of young girls that Simone, Gabby and Laurie inspired.
I set up a gymnasium fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free gymnastics or with low costs in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (especially of black and Spanish origin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnasts to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and to get out of this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and mind decision.
This combination means life benefits for good health, success in school and work.
It's just the inspiration this team will send to us thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for proving the "wonderful force" and for winning the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all origins to become on their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter the next station.
The ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised contract, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would end the disagreement with regard to changes, but 58% of the 37,000 young doctors who attended the election rejected the agreement.
Hunt discovered plans to terminate the contract in July with the fact that NHS was in "no one's country" and that further delays would have a harmful effect on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend work procedures with a view to improving care in non-social hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Youth Doctors Committee last night stated: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contracts, especially in the sense that the current labour crisis will increase and therefore the fair treatment of all doctors.”
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors enters the new contract, progress is needed and time is coming.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiation met with an eagerness to engage Dr and often with a defiant silence from the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's last month's promise that this option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt now has to act, push for expulsion and solve the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last stage at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed, as sisters and specialists were invited to attend the doctor who was among the protestors.
The ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised contract, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would conclude the disagreements concerning the changes.
BMA wants higher pay for work on the weekend for 54 000 young doctors who would be the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the president of the NHS employees, urged young doctors not to enter any positions.
Mortimer said: “The defence action will only achieve little or nothing, but pressure will arise on the already overloaded teams and services and will increase anxiety, exhaustion and disruption for patients, treating staff and their families.”
In the past two months, we have dealt with the advice of young doctors and with the Ministry of Health, and others have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervisor and informant.
Employers hoped that continued positive involvement in other important issues - such as stress, flexibility in schools, further training for those returning after career interruptions, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study freedom and gender pay - was evidence of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health take agreements that were reached with BMA in November, February and May.
The medicine for 60 crowns per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a medicine that is estimated to be about sixty crowns (two pounds).
The medicine against blood clotting Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recovery in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now administered for 12 months after the heart attack to reduce the risk of death or other seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the medicine be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, NHS Watchdog NICE recommends that people be given for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart attack every year, and a quarter of them suffer another seizure or heart attack.
Infection and death are caused by a build-up of fat that forms a related layer on the walls of the artery.
If this level is severed, blood clots may occur, blood clots may block access to the heart and heart attack.
If the wound is released, the blood clot can continue, block the flow of blood into the brain, and cause the brain to die.
People who have already had a heart attack have been exposed to a higher risk of further seizure.
Ticagrelor, who manufactures the British company AstraZeneca and which is sold under the commercial name Brilique, reduces the risk of the occurrence of accidents.
It is recommended that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg with aspirin twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “In spite of the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who have another heart arrest or death - often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition may have a significant negative effect on the quality of the patient’s life.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further heart arrests and death in people who have already experienced a heart attack.
We are pleased that when Ticagrelor is given a preliminary recommendation, we can extend the possibilities of treatment that are available to thousands of people who will be able to take it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially about the risk of bleeding - is limited over the three-year period, it is not recommended in the proposal for treatment over this period.
With computer culture, frauds in Muslim areas began to flourish
The mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was dismissed last year for corruption, which was linked to the government's report.
The culture of political correctness has led to an overview of the widespread fraud in Muslim communities, as reported in the government report today.
Ex-Minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticises the police, election inspectors and councillors for ignoring the abuse of their will for "responsibility to ethnicity and religion."
The former community secretary, now the leader of anti-corruption attacks, said that threatening the voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police should make the cordon against the polling stations and protect the feared voters.
He recommended that the voters take the ID and can prove who they are in the elections.
At present, voters will only enter their name and address.
The report further proposes that the person’s fingers should be put on the floor when the vote is delivered with an unscrupulous ink in order to prevent a double vote.
Whistleblowers should have greater protection, says Pickles.
It calls for greater access to documents from the meeting and decisions taken by the informal committees or by the working group.
"It is not only about protecting against electoral fraud, but also about protecting the local government from the wider corruption environment and the financial frauds that go hand in hand with it," he said.
The report requested Downing Street as a result of the election scandal in Tower Hamlets in western London.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court decided that the mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after charges of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "cinically attacked" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his criticism of the accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, according to his words, "has led his campaign so that it is a religious duty of the Muslims to vote for it."
As many as 300 votes were questioned or as a result of a theft of identity, when a person votes and betrays himself to someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud in the corresponding vote - which it is claimed that the senior members of the Muslim community in the course of the vote put pressure on people to vote for the candidates they chose.
Sir Eric, on the picture, gave several recommendations on how to clean the electoral system, including the presentation of the ID file
His report states: “Provide evidence that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were under pressure to vote in accordance with the will of the older, and above all in communities from Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
"They were concerned that... the state institutions had closed their eyes to such behaviour because of "politically correct" sensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric presented 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including for political activists to be forbidden to manipulate with a corresponding vote and thus prevent the "putting of votes."
The report, which now evaluates Theresa May, also requests more detailed controls in registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and dose fraud.
Consider the possibility of asking the voters to submit a record of identity before the vote.
Use an unscrupulous ink on people's fingers when voting to prevent a person from choosing twice.
Systematic checks of the nationality of persons shall be carried out to ensure that they are able to vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence shall be limited to three years.
To prevent political agitators and activists from manipulating submitted correspondence voices and electoral envelopes.
To give the police permission to create around the election rooms of the cordon.
To amend laws to make it easier to reach people who are developing an illegal burden under the 1983 Reform Act.
Ban the posting of photos in the election rooms.
Require that only English (with the exception of Wales) be employed in the election rooms.
Enhancing training and ensuring that employees comply with the rule that voters go to the polling stations individually.
Sir Eric criticises the London police and says it's "surprising", that after the Tower Hamlets case, no criminal charges were filed.
"The Court of Justice ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the litany of corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty over the scope of the underlying doubts - in the strength of evidence of a criminal act.
It also criticises the inconsistency of "control of polling stations" in the department for the registration of volunteers at the council.
Sir Eric said: “The fate of the court in the case of Tower Hamlets wakes up.
Our nation has a proud link to parliamentary democracy, but the worrying and hidden proliferation of electoral frauds and the refusal of some authorities threatens this reputation.
Familiarity of the Cyclical Twinkle of the Duke of Kate and other well-known personalities at the Olympics in Rio
The fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio went crazy this week to the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, which is even supposed to be similar to the Duke of Cambridge.
But for the past four decades, the Olympics are not far from the only athlete who uses gold this year, who can boast of his own double in a number of well-known personalities - at least not according to social networks.
At the festival of the Olympics in Rio and all the well-known personalities that currently appear on our screens, the FEMAIL column for women has drawn up a list of the Olympics that are more than far similar to the Hollywood celebrities.
As a hunted animal: A member of the American team of firefighters Brady Ellison (left) was compared to Leonardo DiCaprivi from the small
In addition to Kate's double cycle, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be a twin of Leonardo DiCapria star.
A champion of the U.S. team of firefighters, Brady Ellison, caused a storm on Twitter after his images were invented on which he was supposed to be like a Wall Street wolf.
Brady himself noticed the media madness and admitted that he was hearing from a little girl about his similarities with Lee.
"There's no big similarity he can see on his own, except for the cows," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a guy and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted this year even more: the imaginary image between the British jump to far away Greg Rutherford and the favorite artist Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast, Aliye Mustafin, with her big, prominent eyes, was said to be a copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South Africa swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the Gel Matthew Morrison series for several years.
And for change: The user thinks Nathan is a "athletic version" actor from the film Start (Inception)
Another long-standing comparison is the comparison of the tennis star Rafael Nadala and the actor Josh Hartnett, who have similar dense eyes and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov is proud not only to eat the same dish and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord has. And about Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, fans say it looks like "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Powerful women: Hope Sol (left) football star and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter series (right) have a similar shape of face and eyes
Not only one: Twitter user was very pleased to see the similarities also others
On waves theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a similar view of couples
One Twitter user recently expressed his satisfaction at the fact that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical."
Football star Hope Sol and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter's series have a truly incredible form of face and eyes.
Among the other favourite comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of the artist Laura Linney, or the holder of gold medals for Gaby Douglas gymnastics, proud of her beautifully broad smile, who like copying the smile of Gabrielle Union, the stars of Bravo film, girls!
Commentary of the CBC Olympics station apologized for saying that the Chinese swimming party said it was "blowing"
Mid-term live transfers from the Olympics at the CBC station led to the selection of the performance of fourteen-year-old Ai Yanhan by Byron MacDonald. The swimming pool ended at the fourth place of women's race at 4x200 m staff free style
The Canadian CBC station was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was "stirred like a stink" and "blowed".
Commentary Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was turned off when at the end of the finals of the women's staff at 4x200 meters free-style began to draw his own opinions.
MacDonald, who had the CBC's commentaries to bring "resurrection", among other things, said, "This little 14-year-old from China has given it away, you fool."
Too much excitement, it smelled like a smell, it exploded.
Thank you.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) sailed the second race staff at 1:57.79 - at 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and enabled Canadians to reach China.
The viewers in Canada began to call online quickly and were frightened by the tone and language that the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: "Has the speaker told the CBC that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "blowed"???"?
The idiot didn't notice he's still on the show."
Ai Yanhan from China at the final women's staphyte race at 4x200 meters free style was described as: "The little 14-year-old from China gave it up, you fool."
Critics Byron MacDonald on Twitter came from all sides and many asked for his withdrawal
When Twitter users found out how rude Byron MacDonald is, they didn't stay back.
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live comment and said: "We apologize for the comment on the performance of the swimming pool that escaped the broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
The CBC station finally apologized more than 90 times to the people who tweeted in response to the comment
Co-rapporteur Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC then copied and filed their apology for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The station also quickly apologized and published a statement.
She's honestly sorry that the words were pronounced, she shouldn't get to the ether.
We quickly apologized to our viewers in the broadcast and to those who watch us on social networks.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimming pool, not the swimming pool itself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unhappy choice of words. Byron is deeply sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to explain his note by saying that he did not want to sound like a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize now for the comment I made last night after the women's workshop," he said in a broadcast from the Olympics at the CBC station.
"I had in mind the performance of the swimming pool and not the person of the swimming pool as such."
"There's no need to say that I didn't mean any offense and I'm very sorry."
Customers in Primark are humiliated by a woman who has been reluctant to try the underwear in the middle of the store
When the woman got up to try out her pants on the sales surface in the middle of Primark, they were not sure which way to look.
To make it even worse, she tried how her size fell, took her pants off, and returned them back to the regiment.
In the review, she continued and finally tested four pair of pants in the shop in Bouverie Place shopping center in Flokeston.
Primark shop in Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where a woman tried her pants before returning to the store
The mother of two Jenny Davidson children, who was in the shop at the time, stated that a mysterious woman had "re-dressed and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe in their own eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took her pants off, took her own pillows and pants off and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - she just stood there, acting like monkeys."
"Everyone just watched her dress up again, and obviously she didn't like it because she came back to the regula."
She did the same with three others before finally decided she didn't like anything, got dressed again and left.
"It seemed that she was not at all wrong with who was watching - nor that she would think of the man who was supposed to buy the pants she tried."
Ms. Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said: "This idea is that someone will take home the pants that someone else had on and nobody cleaned them up. It's disgusting."
It happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I picked up the things she had obviously tried to get them out of the sale – which is also the only right thing.”
"It would scare me to bring home a new coat and find out that she had another woman on her side, raised them and they weren't washed."
Primark's speech shop said: "Prmark knows about the incident that occurred in our trade in Folkestone on Tuesday, 9 August."
All the products concerned were downloaded from the sale.
How to Defend the Arms Attack by Krav Maga
The world out there is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com, it could be safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, the state-owned Krav Magic Federation living in New York, to find out how to deal with armed wolves near the distance.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain an advantage over the rapist, whether he's getting close to you in front or behind.
If you get close to the back, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "have a free shot".
Then you will grasp the weapon between your forwards and the shoulder just before you strike it in the face with a free bow.
Then he follows his knees to the weak, and while the attacker turns in pain, you draw a weapon out of his hand, hit his head in the face, and start to step back, and you hold the weapon aimed at him.
If a armed man approaches you in front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the fire line, grab a gun and beat it so that the dealer can not shoot.
At the same time, put the weapon into the force and hit the attacker into the chest, then thrust the weapon out of his stabbing and begin to retreat, while still at peace with him.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video where you'll see exactly how Misrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get out of overcoming - if you are not the great Krav Maga - is to spend all the cash.
Traveler Ian Wright oils the most spicy places in Europe to travel guide
The British traveler decided to undergo a difficult test of his immune system and a david reflex - olysing the most spicy and disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and writer of travel Ian Wright (51), from Suffolk, for proof of the strength of his immune system, surrounded the euro banker with his tongue, entombed on Piccadilly Circus, the button cried on the train's toilet and the Russian public phone.
He used the luminometer to show himself and all of us what he's allowed to do.
The experiment, based on which the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed, brought interesting results.
The attack of the payer's button on the train used by thousands of other people may seem quite repulsive, but perhaps in the kitchen closet there is in fact a lot more harmful bacteria.
Throughout his journey across Europe, Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals about strengthening the bacteria of the wheat florie and his own health.
Luckily, none of what he smelled left anything worse in his mouth than his shoe.
Ian Wright celebrated himself by testing the resistance of his intestines on the roads around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system completely safely - from public checkpoints to train stations after the crash.
In the film he filmed, he says: “I haven’t been very healthy since I was a child, and I’ve been giving myself everything I could, from the clay after eating worms and boiled water. ”
In the film, his reputation was confirmed by a dozacitist.
The only thing he refused was dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple width, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia, but the lipstick refused after its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producers Valio filmed the travelers' film called The Lickhicker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom
In the film, he said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever felt in the bathroom."
Nothing more dirty than this!
I'm not gonna smell anything because it's disgusting here.
Film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed in collaboration with the Finnish producer of Valio dairy products.
Mr Wright's company has provided Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help people to strengthen the wheat bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio for decoration, jazz and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow the occupation and at the same time make it possible for us to explain the benefits of the probiotics.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended with the idea "Let's call Ian."
It is said that interest in the health of cereals is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about producers, we wanted to put them in wider contexts - good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of stomach health and how it is connected to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy cereals is a global phenomenon, and through this document we have provided consumers with interesting information.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's say this, Ian would lose my respect if he smelled something of what I wanted him to do - like the nasty Russian toilet that appears in the movie."
Some things were naturally easier for Ian, others rather difficult.
I'm glad we made some of those dirty things.
Valio carried out a study in 2015 that showed that 84% of respondents combined their lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and stomach health and 58% of respondents indicated that at least occasionally they used products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
The family socially needed before the move destroyed the general building in Saltash, Cornwall
The family of the socially needed left the damage to their general home of 50,000 pounds after they had been accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner, Shaun Trebilcock, were moved from home to Saltash, Cornwall, after a number of complaints against him.
After their violent move from home, apartment officials were shocked when they found that the property was in a state of emergency.
There were holes in the vaults, the floor covering was torn down, the floors fell on the floor and the walls were covered.
The family has already moved and it is considered that she lives in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing in Cornwall Housing, said she was worried about saving the house.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, as this property is likely to be known as "not so much a part" of Cornwall.
This family is not well known and their names are not well known.
Couples have three sons who occasionally lived in the house, and the police have stated that the horrors of the family were street fights using baseball bats, threatening the surrounding population, using drugs, distribution of drugs, and loud screams, quarrels and clues.
Skeldon (47) whose name was mentioned in the lease contract was sentenced to anti-social behaviour in June.
In a few rooms in the house, which may have been torn down, they found intoxicating waste.
In the house where drugs were distributed in the past, the floor cover was removed
Neighbors say they saw them on the street as they peared, and people regularly called the police here.
Cornwall Housing and her partner forced her out of the house this week after they had received an additional 11 weeks to move voluntarily.
The neighbor who got sick welcomed the move because their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone at all."
We lived next door for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, they can't count at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because there was incredible silence here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, manager of oversight in Cornwall Housing, stated that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were regularly called to the house
Waste and old toys fell into the bulk of the common house
He adds: “It is a shame that the tenants were unable to take responsibility for their own conduct and for the conduct of their families.
It was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to scare her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team has done, the Devon and Cornwall police and local community members who have been firmly informed.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to the neighbors and at the same time bring the message that we will not tolerate sexual behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of the rent who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.
Contaminated mattress, which remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after moving
Workers will now have to remove the waste that remains buried around the house
In 2014, she carried out police in the house of ragia and found more than 70 grams of rope, weight, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was punished when she was found guilty of holding Class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was designed on the basis of a home for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Tanya and her partner are now living in a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they'll try to move tenants who violate the rules of their leases
Angela Crowová of the Denov and Cornwall police stated that the move was a clear message for other tenants who would continue to violate the rules.
"This is a message for all those who think they can behave impartially, and for those who would like to follow such conduct," she said.
The police of Denov and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and non-social behaviour and will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal terrified after a low crossing of a military triske plane over the beach
Tourists enjoying the sunflowers in Portugal's Aveir were terrified of death
Portuguese military aircraft P-3C Orion flew to incredible low
Military aircraft declared that it was a exercise flight, and continued that there was no danger of safety
At a time when a low - flying three - mile [2 km] climbs over the crowded beach, the frightened tourists panicked.
In dramatic scenes it is seen how the military plane reaches almost the distance of the sun to the sand beaches of the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The tourists began to wonder after they were disturbed by the noise of the engine of a three - plane plane without seeing what was coming out of the darkness.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several recruits who published video recordings of the dramatic overrun on social networks, said: “The plane passed through twice really low and at one point it seemed to be going away.”
Nuno Arroy adds: “I was surfing, and I really thought the plane would fall on my head.”
Tourists on the Aveira beach were terrified when a plane flying low emerged from the darkness
The Portuguese military aircraft today declared that the pilot P-3C Orion was on the exercise flight to identify the fishing vessels by the coast and had to move low because it was the only way to control the ships.
The aircraft reportedly flew somewhat below the usual due to the poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the aircraft insists that the safety of the people was not threatened.
The forest fires this summer destroyed part of the mainland of Portugal and requested four victims on Madeira Island.
Portuguese military aircraft today declared that the pilot had to fly low due to dense fog and smoke from fires that prevented him from seeing
The pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels during the training.
Half of funeral services do not comply with the rules.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the legislation.
The Czech Trade Inspectorate (CHOI) found this in the second quarter of checks.
According to it, funeral services do not most often inform others of their prices or do not issue written confirmation of the acceptance of the order.
ČOI placed 41 bribes in the total value of 73,000 crowns.
Today, her spokesman Jiří Fröhlich was informed.
Inspectors have found a doubt in 47 out of 95 checks.
In addition to not being informed of the prices and lack of confirmation, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at other prices than they had been agreed upon.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially uncertified measure.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of 7077 crowns.
These were packages for urns, candles and candles, which were not properly marked with mandatory information.
"Because in this specific area of services there is still a violation of the law, control actions will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
The London schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolchildren who had been sent from London last year to join the IS, died in Syria.
Legal representative Tasnime Akunjee said the family learned about her death in the Syrian Rack a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that she was probably killed during a Russian air raid in Rakce, which is the property of a group in the country.
Sultani was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died at the time she was preparing to flee the war to a land that had been conquered and to return to Britain.
"Man wants to believe that the only good for all of this - as a message and a warning to others that these are real dangers associated with the road to the war zone - is that he will make people from when they make decisions," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolchildren from eastern London arrived in February 2015 on the plane to Turkey and then on the bus to the border with Syria.
Sultany’s family learned that she had married an IS warrior in Syria and had been widowed for several months.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, he leaves Garland as the candidate of the Supreme Court.
Leader of the Senate on the democratic side of Harry Reid says he is convinced that the presidential election candidate for the Democrats Hillary Clinton is appointing Judge Merrick Garland to the highest court in the case of his election.
The Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, even though President Barack Obama appointed it already in March.
The leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnel, says that the person who replaces the retired judge of the Supreme Court will elect the future president.
Reid announced on Thursday during the conference call that he believed Clinton would choose Garland "with certain degree of confidence."
Reid's speaker later stated that he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether Garland would be named, and that he was just speculating.
He evaluated Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "discover the ship" by choosing someone else.
Garland is president of the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Reid said that the republics that block Garland's appointment are "obligators" and "spocks" of the Republican candidate to the Presidential Office of Donald Trump.
He said Trump wouldn't fit in with the office.
According to the magazine Treatments, our calendars are for "women and men"
The magazine Treats works closely with photographer David Bellemer to issue a calendar for 2017, inspired by Pirelli's 70-year-old calendar.
But instead of the well-known personalities you are trying to find another generation top models for your 2017 NU.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine was full of trouble from Playboy from the old school because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing it for women.
He obviously thinks the calendar too.
"We must return to the display of overtime and classical tensions, when women and men are pleasantly felt and let themselves be inspired by the photos of the woman's body," Shaw said in a press release to the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a wonderful piece of art.
Models can send their images online or personally during open competitions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl direct: who really buys the gram phone boards?
Vinyl loves the isolation of a middle-aged man.
Before you decide to pay a section of comments with cuneiform notes under the pseudonym Not AllPeopleIn the Middle Ages, we state that this statement comes from real data.
According to YouGov, so much discussion about the rise of the gramophone boards is linked not to the boom of millennials who want to love the original property of the physical object, but to the nostalgia of the middle age.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are the most likely people between 45 and 54 years of age.
Young people 18-24 are at least likely.
In fact, it is not about collecting an enthusiastic fan - all of this has an emotional dimension: older people who buy gramophone boards are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56%) versus 53%) and are happy to be alone (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGo's real?
If this blog was broadcast as a television report, the camera would follow me as I go out into the dirty street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and gesticularly wide. Then I would stop, pull out my hands and say something authoritarian, like, "Then let's look at it."
Let's take a look at that.
While Soho's heart slowly loses its charm and charm - the buildings once occupied by independent sellers, hotels, restaurants and food, clothing and office needs - several fantastic specialised shops with Gramophone Desks have yet to be filled.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while. I'll get into the vicinity of different men in these shops and try to see what their age and emotional mood is.
Stuart (55), a relative from Glasgow, who I'm looking for from Sister Ray (pockets: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (pockets: eight middle-aged men, one woman about 20) has an afternoon meeting in London and searches the shops to fill several hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I have about three or four thousand recordings.
All those tapes glue the walls of his living room - in the picture above (he sent me an e-mail, I didn't follow him home).
This huge amount of albums and singles also has thanks to the fact that they can afford it: they can now buy a record of phonographs that they could not afford when they came from the beginning, and they buy again what they sold in their youth and had no wind.
“Many of what I buy is from the end of the 60s and from the beginning of the 70s. These are things that would be issued when I was 11 or 12 then I was too small and couldn’t arrange them,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy recordings are probably introverts that they like themselves, and he adds: “I don’t smoke or drink too much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of customers he meets are in the YouTube profile.
He also noticed a new flood of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback and felt forced to buy their old phonograph records back.
According to my interviews, the people of their collections were most often released between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their gramophone records and bought a CD, now sell their CDs to buy their gramophone records back," he says.
That could explain the boom of lovers of the gramophone board of a certain age.
But what's the supposed emotional importance of a phonograph board?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find in a store like Phoenix that you will find a pleasant community of people with similar thoughts in a store with music.
According to Weze, some older customers are particularly damaged by the wireless payment system.
In the digital world, some favoritisms can feel paid and decided on the known environment of the envelopes of the gramophones, things that bring memories of peaceful learning.
"I think that filling the gap or property of something material can bring certain comfort," says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, and I think I've got a lot of people, too.
It's an easy way to fill the place in your head.
"We're all like their social workers!" the co-worker is called from a bunch of gramophone boards.
An ICM study in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought their vinyl album a month ago had not heard it yet.
According to the survey, 41% of the surveyed gramophones that never use, while 7% of those that buy gramophone boards do not have gramophones.
At this point of the report, he probably seemed really upset when he walked through the hump of the compilation bossa nova.
The aspect of "trophy" and the recovery of interest is something Jonny (42), who works in the Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
"Someone recently came and said, "I don't have a phonograph yet, but I want to buy on the radiohead desk so we can put it on the shelf," he says.
The percentage of these is not big, but it's happening.
It's more about the product page than about music.
People come to us who say, "I don't have a phonograph."
These are the younger people, not the older, grown-ups who get into it.
Popp, where at the present time, almost one-thirty-one-thirty-one-thirty gramophone desks have been replaced, has many more visitors on my arrival.
There's a couple of 70-year-olds, tourists who take pictures, pubertyes and women of middle age.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the shops before - from the speakers, instead of the dazzling jazz, the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex, it is good to see various customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but you will find it hard to estimate an intruder of mental trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) spends a few minutes in Fopp and searches various phonograph records in the sink.
It's one of those who's more likely to look at the exhibits than to lose a lot of heat.
According to his words, he doesn't make a lot of money, so he doesn't seem to think that he'd collect the phonograph records.
It's worth a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on your computer or something, but the phonograph records have their magic... "is a source of excitement.
I can't explain - it's unique.
My last stop is a trade that supposedly inspired a new generation of gramophone board lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I look like I'm a very busy boy girl in the nested giants and I'm following a bunch of naked girls who just hang around Polaroid cameras, and then my father and daughter decide to buy Crosley's gramophone.
On the left is the closet, whose walls cover Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of phonograph tables.
No one's looking at them - maybe because they're just for decorations and some are so high on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's just a vinyl trick.
But since any attraction to him could mean more money for the sector and send several customers to the depth of Soho for the next one, there is not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is probably more time and money than in other areas, is also where the most luxurious goods which vinyl is certainly.
But while my findings suggest that the results of YouGov are accurate - at least in stores with gramophone boards, they do not take into account the large number of collectors and vinyl lovers who actually exist, in stores with gramophone boards and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or in offices.
He certainly does not spend the Thursday morning sweating after a store with a phonograph desk on Berwick Street, passing recordings and avoiding the sight of a strange, 30-year-old false TV moderator, hiding behind the back of nothing indistinguishable men of middle age.

Court in France refused to take over business in the jungle refugee camp
The court in France rejected the order of the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial this week of the Calais office, it was suggested that the state should be able to abolish a total of 72 provisional shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes after energy drinks, offer hair cuttings, and in provisional restaurants sell tea for 50 cents or basic meals for several euros.
The Prefect's office in Calais argued that places need to be destroyed because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they mean a danger of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organisations at the court have stated that shops and restaurants are vital and that free food offered by the State-supported association and other groups does not provide food supplement for increasing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Controversy provisional shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The Court of Justice in Lille decided that there was no legal basis that would prevent people from operating 72 provisional transactions, but stated that Prefect Calais's objections were "very understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants have a much greater role to play than just feeding people who "live under extremely desperate conditions."
He said that spaces provide peaceful places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that the Demolice threatened was a café in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, which is operated by a non-profit organization and which offers daily 200 meals, hours of English and French and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable people without accompanying them in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition for the protection of the "children" café.
The Guardian received a letter stating that the closure of the coffee shop “was a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.”
Charity organisations Help Refugee and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of refugees in the camp after the sharp increase of the arrivals over the years has increased to over 9,000 - which is still the largest throughout the period.
You thought he was dead.
The wolf crosses himself and the volleyball Ghost.
"From March I could normally train," he reported on the start of the summer preparation in full force.
What happened to you?
I had both lung embolism, and that's why I had heart problems.
Because when I was at the University of Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So he made a long flight to Asia?
I've had a stroke for two years, and I didn't know about it.
It hurt, no one found me.
Then the hit got up.
There's a broken soul in the joint, it's gonna hurt all the time, especially when it's spinning or changing the weather.
But nothing that would limit me is more aesthetic.
Were you worried about your life?
He had.
Last year, I didn't know I had embolism at the summer tournament in the Woods, and I couldn't move there anymore.
I spilled my blood tonight.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, and I was still completely fixed for five days.
I actually thought I was dead in the Woods, and my girlfriend and family.
I've seen you somewhere else.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I had to live through it. Now it's just going up.
I know I have some blood problems, that I need to be more careful when I fly.
But it can do anything.
Once I wanted to go back to Prebram's preparation last year, there was still a problem with my heart.
It's all right now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself for home to be able to play again.
I'll put it down. I'm physically better at it than before.
What do you expect from Uste?
I'm glad the party looks good, most of the boys know.
I'm curious about two other foreigners coming in.
I hope we sit down with people so that we can fit it together.
Will you lift your mouth?
There was a reputation for revelation, but every season is different.
Brno was eight two years ago, now the second is over.
There's a new team in the mouth, only a few players left.
It was the last in extralysis, so there's a big room for improvement.
The way we use it, it's up to us.
We'll see who's gonna be the first rounds, maybe we won't.
Is Brom's watch a guarantee of success?
He's already experienced and has a lot of experience, he'll think of a better place than the last place.
But my income did not depend on him, I agreed earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, I'm a big friend with one of them, and it was agreed that they'd act here.
I'm not gonna say a name.
Finally Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been practicing for decades, he's an old good player.
Put us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to hectic, and I like to get a chance on a team not like that.
I've been in Prebrama for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team right now, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a stranger, in Ústí he is already training Australian Boehm.
What does it look like?
I know him in the circumstances, at the university we played against ourselves in the group.
And sometimes we had fun together, sometimes we sat together after the fight, so we've met friends.
We beat them three, and right away at the start of the summer preparation in the Usta.
He's got a Slovenian girlfriend, he's a fellow.
There's still American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze coming.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote with the American, it looks like a nice boy, a Brazilian guy who's gonna know English.
Did you contact the American?
I thought it was a good idea.
I'm a recorder, so the one who makes it, so I should communicate with everyone.
Right away, I found out what it's like for players, I found myself online, I saw some videos.
He was all right, the kid's jumping, he's tall.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, it seemed like a joke, it'll come to us.
How do you feel about the recording unit position?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm only going to be forty-four, and I don't care how to get it done.
I'd rather be in the center of action. I'd rather lead a team than be led by someone else.
I guess I don't want to play anymore if I'm supposed to be like a second recorder and dedicate myself to it for the full time.
How many times have you been single?
Half the time in Pribra, when it didn't go to Kusto as a captain, he got hurt, and then there was a problem with the money, and he left.
Since then, we've been standing up and I've been playing.
In Brno, whose I'm a kidnapper, I've got one and two.
A great year was in Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers, and I just picked out Prebram.
That's where Budjejovices wanted me, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season for the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short caption remains the Phelp's domain.
"To be back on stage winners and to hear the hymn is sweet as always," laughed Phelps and then again had eyes full of tears.
His fiancée and mother were riding in the mirror again, the son of Boomer this time slept quietly in his ears.
I've been living for a week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started racing, and in a couple of hours it'll be after all, he said it's funny.
At the Phelps final in two seconds, a silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino won a long bet.
Bronz won Chinaan Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from the last world championship.
After Alu Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (way) Michael Phelps is a third sportsman who controlled the same discipline in four games behind him.
After most of the competition with Phelps, another American Ryan Locht and the household Thiago Perreira were in charge.
While gold miners in the final Crusader’s 50th century planted themselves on a thin finisher, they fell outside the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance in Rio to expand its unique medal collection.
Shortly after the flagship was announced, he posted to the final race for 100 meters of motorcycles.
The legend could not have been obscured even by the countryman Ryan Murphy, who won the double mark - after a hundred wins in Rio and a double track.
In the final, he left 37 sets of Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, the third of which ended the Russian Jevgenij Rylov.
While Murphy has only fifth of the doubles since the last world championship, in Rio he became a marked king.
From the intellectual throne he sat Larkin, with the same double he did just at the last world championship.
At the Olympics, he won the medals only now.
In the royal century, Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel were divided into gold.
For sixteen years Oleksiak it was the fourth medal in these games, for Manuel the second after silver from the staff.
Blue gold won the OH as the first African American in history.
I believe I can be inspiring to others.
These medals are for everyone who comes after me, sports will become love for them and get to where I am, said touched by Manuel.
The third was Swedish Sarah Sjöström, who won a 100-metre motorcycle race in Rio in the world record and still has silver from the rosary double.
By the end of the sixth world recordman, Australian Cate Campbell.
Japan's Rie Kanet, for which it was the first Olympic medal in the 1970s.

The second silver in Rio was won by Ruska Julia Jeffimov, who, due to the start of the games despite the doping past, is facing the inviolability of spectators and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won at the courthouse, and I don't know why I should still answer these questions.
I'm so tired of it, the Russian swimmer said.
The right to start in Rio has expired until the special panel of sports arbitration CAS just before the start of the game.
They took my call and I won.
If anyone likes it or not, or if he has another opinion to turn to the arbitral tribunal, she added.
Herman: Unfortunately, we could have won.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs had a special day.
Just a few hours before the match, they found out who he was going to face.
They had to manage tactically.
And then, in a non-traditional time, the little short game number one started.
The first set did not start well, then the opponent jumped, but at the state of 19:19 they failed the final.
In the second, they were clearly better and comparable, but the decision-makers failed them.
Above all, a number of services shown meant losing 10:15 and playing with the Olympic tournament.
"We could defeat the Russians," said Hermann.
How would you assess the game?
Herman: After the unfortunate start before I played, we got pretty into the game.
At the end of the last balloon, I got a receipt that I used to get used to.
We lost that set, which was key.
In the next set, we came up with an overview of the playing field, another defense, and we pushed on the service.
In the tee-break, there was a terrible crash, and we were dressed up on this page.
It was a disappointment because we could defeat Russia.
Sluková: The damage to the beginning of the first set, we escaped there.
We were able to download it, but we missed the points.
The second set was great, and in the third, he decided the service.
We made a lot of mistakes.
We gave them five points, and it was about those five, and there was a lot of deception.
It's a shame because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in the little castle number one?
Sluková: Similar to in China in the adjacent courtyards.
The media and the atmosphere were different.
There was one hour at night, full silence, music was not playing, nothing.
It was a difference to the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the name of the opponent an hour before the match?
Hermann: She was special.
We started practicing the game without knowing the anti-games, so we couldn't make a tactical preparation like the other teams.
But Simon (knocking Nausch) caught the tactic on almost all the options that were there.
He had prepared a lot of paper with tactics, so after this page we were quite well prepared.
Do you remember ever starting a midnight game?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played in the 11th, but not in the 12th.
Blok Rusky Birlovova in the pre-play-off to OH in Rio.
Beach volleyballists Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in an envelope in the pre-play-off to OH in Rio.
Was it unpleasant?
Sluková: By playing the last two games in the group since the tenth, we had the regime moved before.
This was two more hours.
It's strange, I can't imagine that another sport has a sportsman who has to give his best performance within 12 hours.
But I think we've prepared the best we could.
We knew it would be, but it's not quite typical, and I guess it won't be my favorite play time.
How do you evaluate the Olympic experience?
Herman: Since the process of the group was our goal, it's on one side okay, good.
We did what we said.
But now I'm sad after the fight.
Sluková: I'll sleep from it and I'll remember the Olympic tournament only positively from tomorrow.
The big brother is here, the first peaceful SIM is coming.
You won't escape her.
The new rules are to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who will decide to arrange a SIM for one of the local operators during their stay in Thailand.
So not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas who work in Thailand, for example, or have married.
The Secretary-General of the Office of National Broadcasting and the Telecommunications Commission, Tatarn Tantasith, informed that there would be no exceptions.
The SIM sales plan for foreign nationals was presented by the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
The new measures allowing monitoring of their positions shall be adopted by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasitha, it is a means of maintaining national security, which enables a criminal activity to be dealt with by foreigners.
In addition, so-called tourist SIMs have help to detect also persons who exceed the authorised length of stay.
In the case of sellers, a special SIM for foreigners should also appear on the side of a SIM specifically designated to Thais.
The difference will be precisely the monitoring function, which will be permanently switched on in the cartridges of persons with no Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This function at the SIM for Thai is not because you can always be easy to track," Tantasith added.
It must be added that in Thailand there are no prepayments anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years one of the operators gave free launch to SIM tourists at airports.
They were so anonymous.
The introduction of the same measures as Thailand also considers ten telecommunication regulators from other Asian countries including, for example, Malaysia or Singapore.
They are also currently subject to mandatory SIM registration, but the legal use of the monitoring system is not possible.
However, the missing measures do not mean the obligation for a foreigner to arrange for entry into the country of the local operator’s SIM.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be brief.
Operators of the country concerned only know relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. after the application of the SIM to their network.
So they know the phone number, not the owner information.
However, the difference in roaming prices against the rates of local operators is so devastating that during their stay in Thailand, the majority of tourists begin to look after local SIM.
The efforts of the authorities to oversee the movement of foreigners from foreigners living in Thailand have legally been subject to immediate criticism.
The Tantasith situation calms down and, in relation to the protection of privacy, the smart system compares to the obligation to provide a residence address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a judicial order if a particular person is to be monitored.
Any abuse of the system will threaten an unspecified penalty.
"If the service provider follows the SIM position without a court order, he will be charged with a criminal offence," Tantasith added.
The system should also maximize the use of prepaid tickets.
While there is currently a recycling of a specific number until after the 90-day period after which the SIM is not registered on the network, a new issue in the case of leaving Thailand may be renewed after 15 days.
Luxury apartment in the new building on Vinohradech has a pool and a porch on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in the new building?
We've been looking for an old-fashioned apartment where most of the property care is owned by administrators.
The condition was that the parking space and elevators in the house were sufficient, which was essentially disqualifying the older building.
Don't talk about problematic acoustics in old homes, problems with climbing floors, high energy demands, and so on.
There were also large terraces, which the old building is not able to offer.
More interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The entire interior for you was designed by architect Lenka Langer with his colleague Kamilou Polákov from Artiga.
Why did you just call them?
Would you recommend working with the expert?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone, if he's proposing an apartment from the beginning, it's a very complex technical process.
The second equation is the very design interior: designers have a much better idea of the scale of possible materials and based on the customer's desire they are able to sweeten the interior properly.
We were already working with architect Lenko Langer on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of a personal recommendation from another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us to rebuild our new apartment in Vinohradech.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous community-dwelling space with a suitable ground for a four-member family, known as a modern but not a cold interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment with the terraces and realize intelligent household control.
And of course, the quality of implementation had to be undermined.
Did you leave everything on the experts, or did you do it on your own in the final form of the interior?
All proposals including technical drawings and samples of materials have been approved, but the proposal has always been taken from architects.
At first, we decided what we expected from the design, and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to include in the proposal, such as a blanket or a drawing.
I think that just our collection of mostly Czech authors including works by Karl Malich, Karl Vysušil, Václav Spaly or Otto Gutfreund the architect helped to guide us in our taste.
The combination of black, white and orange wood was also the idea of architects as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, blankets, textiles, art etc.
Were there any complications you had to give up the original ideas or come to the new ones instead?
I hope only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the building at the time when it was possible to go to the height of our floor for the first time, and found that the prospects we were planning are actually the shadow of the surrounding building.
That's when we literally changed the dispositions overnight from the base.
On the kitchen line also on the wall of the blood wall was used.
In the interior, the wooden surfaces are then dominated by added skin, such as the choking of Norma’s food and bar chairs from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make any changes or is there something you'd like to have today?
I think it's a modern air interior that's primarily fulfilling its purpose.
We don't understand the changes, most of the adjustments after the move took place in the level of shade and living of the terrace.
Perhaps the only climb is on the floor, when the nut tree is shown to us to be too sloppy to house with the dog.
The word architect, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornyová, the authors of the realization.
The apartment is in the last floor of the building, so it was possible to make completely new available solutions and several other adjustments within the building.
The interior is an important element of the location of the lighthouses in the hallway ceiling and the main toilet.
That's how we got daylight into the darker space of the apartment.
The direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from the USSPA is also one of the construction adjustments that was very beneficial for the entire apartment function.
Part of it is also a pool and a squirrel.
You're not negative in comparison with France, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are the origins of Algeria.
I was born in southern France, a piece from the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, which led me to work in a magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I started to feel like I was breathing in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere between people.
I thought every Frenchman was very negative.
People in France are negative in general, but lately it has worsened.
That's interesting that you're referring to negativeism.
Some people like that value the Czech character.
Believe me, you're not negative in comparison with the French.
Some people don't get that much when they come to France, because it's not that much of a tourist.
But it was too much for me.
A big theme is money.
People feel they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen cents, which I think is enough.
Now there's also a problem with people's behavior toward Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor began to look through his fingers just because I'm a Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job, basically anywhere else, and I ran into a free place with Air France here in Prague.
I admit I didn't even know Prague from the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my dad even told me what was going on in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now, and I'm not going to have to imagine that I wouldn't be here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of completely different atmospheres.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't capture any negative reactions or clues, but I feel that people are more free here.
That I can do anything, dress anyway, and no one's gonna judge me.
In France, someone is still looking at you, like you're wearing special clothes and something like that.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
I don't think they're interested in that kind of thing.
Where do you work now?
After working in Air France, I worked for one travel website.
Then another friend and I set up websites that people are offering and looking for a shared home.
So far, we are only working in Prague, but we would like to extend it throughout Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are Czechs from the middle, and two more Czech friends.
I have to say that another specific feature of the Czechs is that they're getting more out of hand at first.
He won't let someone go to the body like that.
It's quite different from where I grew up.
Everyone in the south hugs and kisses the face.
This is different, but I understand it's a cultural issue, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you don't speak Czech.
Is your language barrier a problem?
On the contrary, I've got it pretty simple in Prague, because everyone here speaks English.
Even in the evenings or in the food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have much time.
And by everyone having to communicate a little bit in English, I don't need to learn a language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you met with any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
Not really.
It may also be that I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
There's one experience that strikes me.
My leader, Chechnya, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: They're not French, but Africans.
That touched me pretty much.
But that someone would have a problem with being a Muslim, I haven't had it yet.
And even though my colleague once pointed me at some anti-Muslim demonstration.
He said I wouldn't go to the center and they'd put me in there.
The anti-Muslim demonstration is partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something similar like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, today can happen anywhere.
I may not have been able to imagine that something like this would happen in France.
And it's not just Muslims.
Besides, Islam doesn't even know violence.
For me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists protect your faith?
It's very difficult.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to follow those reports of violence, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that's not my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met at Jiří's place from Podjebrad.
On Wednesday, the common Muslims and Christians demonstrated themselves against violence.
Did you record it?
I didn't know that.
But I understand that people feel the need to prove that they disagree with violence.
I don't think they'd have to do something like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they have failed?
Do you meet with other Muslims in Prague?
My collaborators, for example, are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have quite a wild debate about Islam, because we all see it a little different.
I'm from France, so I've been through another education, and they must have been learning Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinated status of women.
How do you feel?
I don't seem to be undercover in any case.
On the contrary.
I'm a woman, I'm strong.
It's related to the fact that you don't wear any head covering.
For example, hidjab?
And it's signed in the way I was raised.
For example, my mom is a really fundamental Muslim.
She prays five times a day, but she just doesn't wear a coat.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It depends on everyone how he interprets it.
When a person reads the Koran, he should have his own opinion on these things.
So when I read in the Qur'an a passage saying that God had told the Prophet to hide his wife from the sight of others, I said, "I am not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide myself?"
On the other hand, I respect it, and when I get to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the bars are required, I'll take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but I'm doing great in Prague.
I'll even introduce myself to raising my own children here.
I think Prague is the ideal city for it.
The common Muslims and Christians demonstrated themselves against violence.
Jachhart Kozelsko Fenclow's wind in Rio hit the promenades.
Five trips to the sea in the Brazilian Riu de Janiero were carried out by the Czech yachter Veronica Kozelské Fenclové.
In the class, Laser Radial moved in front of the final two steps to the tenth place.
That would ensure Czech participation in the final ride.
You're picking up bags like a box.
They want to compete with the transporters.
The idea of using the already planned routes for the transport of the consignment is by TV director Matej Liška and manager of the Prague Music Club Marek Greger.
With the thought they breathed life into three applications with different geographical scope.
We released the national transfer application in May.
At this point there are thousands of cities buried in it and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this first, before we focus more on abroad, says in the conversation for IDNES.cz, a 40-year-old manager.
How does the Transfer application work, and who can benefit from it?
You'll download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and the details of how big a package you can carry and how much you want to carry.
Someone needs to ask for transport again that day.
Once the route and delivery time are completed, it will be saved and mutual notification will come.
In that moment, a chat will be opened where the two of you will agree to the surrender.
How many people would have to register for you to always find your courier?
I don't know the ideal condition, I can't estimate how many registered and how many roads it takes to be fully optimal and every offer has been filled with demand.
It's already working on the main tanks, and it's logically easier than it's supposed to be on the road between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential of speed and accuracy.
People are still building trust and finding out that no one's running with the package.
Didn't you have to deal with that yet?
How many users have been in the service two months after the release?
At the moment, we have between 5 and 6 thousand people who create roads.
We consider it a success, and we believe that they will be packed.
Doesn't the sender have to wait too long?
We hope that we will be competing for large conglomerates only for the reason that we are able to deliver the thing we need to the same day and for a fraction of the price.
In large companies you'll pay a couple of thousand for delivery within two hours.
You'll have to pay a hundred or less here, because it's the way someone's already doing.
Should traditional transporters be worried about the potential supply of customers in the future?
We hope so.
The market has a huge potential, it feeds a huge international transporter here, as well as a commercial chain, where everyone began to buy and gradually found that quality does not correspond to what they are paying for.
No one wants to find a ticket in the box with a message that the shipment is to be picked up on the sidewalk, first the day after the 19th hour.
At the time, I needed the package for six hours, and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won't praise anyone and send a signal to the competition to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matej Liška (39).
No one has ever acted in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matej Liška as a television director.
In 2014, the LTD Shippancee application began to be used to transport packages that have already been planned between the world metropolises, especially by aircraft.
In 2015, they launched a project for the processing of a company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming lasted three quarters of the year and applications were placed on the market in March 2016.
The transfer application began to develop in December last year and was released this year in May.
This is the local version of Shippancee managed for the Czech market.
The applications Mesík and Mesík Profi have been developed since January 2016 and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
It was the intention from the beginning to make all these applications that would one day merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to put the application down and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the world market as well.
The shared economy is a topic recently and this is an AirBnB or Ubera service.
Don't you have any concerns about action in the area that no one can say so far, where is the boundary of sharing and where is the gray economy?
It's the same as another product.
It is clear to us that if it is successful and we go up there, we will see another step through the grey economy.
But while someone saves and someone makes, it's not the intention of the financial authorities and tax controls.
Each user, either on the one hand or on the other, will be invited to pay his income if he does.
Why do you think the service has such a great potential?
The shipper saves and the carrier earns, respectively, lowers the cost on the road.
That's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
At the time of social networks that divide people, we would like this to be brought closer.
They can create nice stories, people are happy to help someone, and they'll tell themselves about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
People, according to me, have been missing personal access for a long time, and we say that this application is the service of people.
How, then, do you guarantee that the courier will not touch the package?
Each user of the application with the registration shall be accompanied by a civil service certificate and shall provide a bank connection, a payment card or a credit card.
These are channels that give service and human credibility.
Drivers also collect stars on the basis of the transmitter assessment.
We offer insurance, we still ship details.
For uninsured consignment in the event of loss or damage, the courier shall hold the courier, but shall not be held liable under criminal law for the content if there is anything illegal inside and does not know about it.
If he is stopped by the police and finds himself in a closed bag in his bag of self-adhesives or ten kilos [10 kilos] of hash, the criminal responsibility of the consignor is exceeded.
Is there a danger of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
They are registered where necessary by the investigating administrative authority, which as the only one will be able to observe it, and we ourselves are unable to see them, data are protected against abuse.
How much money will the courier get after a successful delivery?
Which determines the price and gets the full amount he's going to say.
The distributors are charged several percent more to facilitate contact.
This money is our profit, but it's just a few percent, because we want to push the volume.
The courier also cannot be accused of not delivering the consignment when it was actually delivered, received and delivered is verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or contents of the package?
You can transfer anything.
We have three sizes, small as a bone of butter, medium as a plate of eggs and large as a bass of beer.
Then there's no further restriction and if someone's got a seat in the car, maybe they'll take the fridge.
Plus the sender has the option to take a picture of the package application, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don't even have to pack things if you don't want to hide the contents of the exhibition.
You're gonna put the forgotten mike in your hand, and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to start the job?
A friend got the idea over two years ago, when I didn't pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo application with an international range that aims primarily at a passenger plane.
At the moment I told him I wasn't going to look for an investor, but I'd like to stay with him myself and give him some savings.
Next year, the development lasted before we founded the company Shippancee LTD in London due to the greater credibility of the entire product.
But this isn't the version you're focusing on right now.
No, marketing has focused on Czech Republic, where we try to catch the application, because it all had birth pains and it's still something to solve and improve.
We are trying to react to the feedback from customers, and the foreign market is not so much in the current situation.
We know it's a long run, but we don't approve, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippancee LTD was the most basic and expensive application, the other two were in their way of upgrade.
The transfer came when we said that the national segment could be far more interesting and that we would at least learn it in Czech.
The third application of Mesík is local for the city.
But he can send the package to the exact address and to the other end of the world.
It works for the senders as well as the Transfer, but the difference is that in it as a courier you see the transmitters in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in the mobile.
The application for couriers who want to live with it, we called Mesíke Profi.
So, someone can make an exposure by picking up packages from the city?
That's right, the last application will be downloaded in Prague like a taxi driver, student, mother on parental leave, someone who wants to take a trip to work.
Now that everyone's fooling around with those tapes, they can collect this all the same.
A person sees where orders are in the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and sent.
It's more cheap than competitive services.
At this point, we're still doing web interfaces that will be difficult for companies to send the shipments, and on the web, they will fill out their data, or they will create points on the map.
Then we're able to use the service to bill every month.
Are you now committed to full consideration of the project?
It's bothering us, but we have it normally at work so that we can use and develop the project.
We're not hiding behind us a strong supranational investor, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped into it with other ideas and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to be able to stall with us not the Czech market, but who should go with us to the world product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The historical part of Titanfall 2 should bring a slightly forgotten pasturage.
This will fix the second part and only the game in it will be more pensitized according to the first information than in the Call of Duty.
The length will move around the standard eight hours and the full will come from just the concept of the network drive in the first part.
It is therefore possible to enjoy freedom of movement, which includes, in addition to running, the possibility of using combat titanium.
In addition to the action passports, the game will contain a level-focused exactly on the reverse movement.
They'll remember the plates and include the ribs.
Therefore, they are the main example of double jumps, running on the roofs and a chain lock.
Sometimes, however, enemies will have to be eliminated.
There will be no missing maps of the site and at the level of special concepts.
In one example, it will be possible to lift and dry the surfaces and close the possible door.
That's how you're going to be like a fighter.
The pace of the game should therefore be linked between the violent action and the calmer moments for exploring the unknown planet.
We're gonna play Jack Cooper's walker, dreaming of a pilot's career.
Cooper at the start of the campaign, together with Captain Lastimos on the alien planet Typhon, who is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And there won't be even a wilder to him.
In addition, in the event of a disaster, he will spare mortal wounds, and Cooper will therefore be tasked with carrying out the captain of the Titan.
His dream of a pilot's career will be fulfilled as soon as he's expected.
The first step, however, will be to steal the battery necessary to repair the robot.
Cooper's calls with the Titan will be important.
The players serve as a source of information about the military's past, but at the same time a robot-customed communication will create humorous moments.
For example, when the titanium is going to remove all the injuries that Cooper is threatening at the planned height.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 brought the server Polygon.
In addition, the result can be assessed in two months and Bonusweb will bring you the first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 is October 28, and that's for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ mark survives, but the original publishing remains dead.
Swedish Nordic company changes name to THQ Nordic.
Following the collapse of the publication THQ, in 2013 a number of his trademarks and the right to use the logo and company name were obtained.
Nordic thanks to this, for example, Darksiders 2 Deathnative Edition or Red Faction Collection package.
In addition, for publishing, there are 23 more games and 13 of them have not yet been opened.
Thirty years ago, at the time of my retirement, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found a younger man, our neighbor, in his 20 ’ s.
I knew it from the beginning - first of all, it was obviously a long time ago, and then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she went in front of me like that.
She's completely gone mad at him.
In those first days, she even changed her voice, had such a girl, a beloved voice.
But when I told her I know what's going on, she got it.
But I've been watching it all.
At that time, he went from work regularly to half a fourth, and so she always went to buy three.
Every day she tried to see him.
Later I found out they were meeting at his bar, in the laundry.
I knew how many times they were right there.
I got my keys, he was determined to get them there.
But I don't know why, after all, I've always stayed home.
I've never been able to go there, take the decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe that my wife has been mentally controlling me.
Soon she found out that I was capable of doing what she wanted.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just such a doll.
Then the neighbors told me they knew about it too.
I was such an asshole that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if all this was broken, it would be bad.
That it's going to happen to everyone in the family, she only had a daughter in her mind.
So I always put it down, go on, go on.
But one time, I went to his apartment to get me some help in the laundry.
He went there with me, and I told him that I got anonymous, that he was meeting my wife and that he was telling everything.
I asked him what he would tell me.
He stood there, shook his shoulders, looked into the ground and didn't say a word.
Then I met his wife on the way from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond to it, and she didn't tell me either.
No one told me back then.
I'm a man who's never gone too far who's got a problem with someone, but find a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I've always relied on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her all and my life will go on.
But it wasn't.
And I've never actually dealt with it.
I've got it in me.
I used to give it to her quite often, but I finally left it for peace.
He lives in the next house and I live with her.
It's just more than my wife's housewife.
She always did everything at home -- cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's working.
She's always been trying to keep me from having another reason to complain.
And it can be said that it's good.
But sometimes I'd like to see her, hug her, and she won't let go.
We're going for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we have.
But she once told me she never loved me.
She loved me and loved me, but she didn't love me.
And I see he loves him today, he's her god.
And I don't like life like that.
Ever since it started and I carried it very badly, I once told her she didn't want to live and I wondered what she would say if I had finished it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought and finally said, "But there's enough room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to create a new French Islamic hope that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After the terrorist attacks, France is fighting radical Islamists, and the government and local Muslim minority are calling for help.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom of expression," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual education in France is taught in the country.
He also wants to stop funding mixing from abroad, when the teachers often come to see jihad with money.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wanted to create a new French Islamic hope, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution replaces the current French Foundation for Islam, which was established by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
It had already contributed to a review of the financial flows between the mixed and the countries that financed their construction.
Soon, though, internal conflicts struck her, and that's why she never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
In front of the new award, the former Minister of Interior and Defence Jean-Pierre Chevonnement, who is known as the founder of the secular state, will probably become the former Minister of Interior and Defence.
In France, about 2500 mixes and prayers, about 120 of them serve radical Islam.
Since 2012, some 80 Islamic clergy have been expelled from the country by the French authorities, and several more decades have considered this step.
This week, the German police also attacked the Jewish clergy.
Imams reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated space where the believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the debate on a new institution was heated in France, which will replace the non-functional reward.
All stepped up further terrorist attacks on behalf of the Islamic State by radical Islamists.
The new award will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mix of domestic resources and also to keep an eye on the assets.
But it's not clear where he gets the money, even though he's considering a few proposals.
One of them is a special fee for halal food, especially for meat resulting from defeats according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by sellers to halal food, which is for the granting of permission.
Some of the money would then travel to the budget of the donation.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French passengers who are released to Mecca.
Every year, they are released from France for a traditional tour to Saudi Arabia about 30,000.
In addition, only teachers who have passed educational programs at the dark universities should be involved in the French mix.
As a result, their preaching should be in harmony with democracy.
The government also shuts down radical mixtures.
"From December we have closed twenty and will follow the next," said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
"There is no place in France for those who declare hate and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was badly injured by an unknown shooter on Friday morning at the shopping center in northern Zaragoza, according to the Independent newspaper.
There was a shooting after the woman and the daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car in front of the shopping mall, where he also started shooting.
According to the witnesses, a man then turned his weapon against himself, says the Independent.
A woman was taken to a hospital with no injured daughter, and for a man in critical condition, she had to get a cure.
The crime occurred around 11 a.m. in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous region of Aragon, near local universities.
With a call from the Spanish agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably the unsolved recent divorce of both partners.
Fun with the cross, we wake up with rhymes, the bells and the chili sauce.
This summer he wants a light, well-fatted meal, but we Czechs are rebellious and we have our tastes and our heads.
And so out of the summer gardens smells of grilled rabbits, bees, wild boars.
Not too healthy, not too easy, yet sometimes with the exception of salad or roasted vegetables.
The truth is, grilling is time-consuming, and it's also a social matter, and no one has to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are also other alternatives to making good sense, which special styling, their preparation is a small ritual, but there is nothing more to be done than to evaporate, to evaporate, to reduce or to breathe.
And they're still contributing to our health.
Whether it's a home sushi or sashi, where quality raw materials and a few well-contained grips are enough to make the preparation a fun and food the very authentic exotic box.
Just like even easier rolls in the rice paper from today's recipe.
Here, there's even a more time-consuming cooking and roasting of rice.
The paper can only be wrapped in water for a moment and then depends only on the imagination of the chef, how he intends to play with the fillings and supplements.
There's no race like race.
The benefits of a number of Asian cuisine are also today that raw materials are already normally available.
Includes pre-filled sweetened curd, which is one of the basic flavors of accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home as well, but the right pink gourmet has a unique spicy oyster and at the same time a delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe, according to which it blends from several kinds of octopus and celery.
Therefore, it is enough to buy a bag of suitable size, and the Annex with demonstrable antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are used, in particular, in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and obtaining food within the most varied celebrations and rituals.
Long numbered banana leaves are widely expanded in a number of countries in Asia or South America as well as "help" for the preparation of the most varied cooked, cooked and roasted foods that are packed in them like in the alobal.
The banana leaf then transmits a specific flavor.
We are allowed to buy in shops with exotic fruit and vegetables, even previously cut into the shape of a doll.
But select only green-leaved sheets, which are clean, unbleached and unbleached.
Similarly, it is easy to make salads from the vasama, sesame and sesame oil.
That one can buy frozen again.
Whoever gets her or prepares sushi is probably going to know a lot of crazy.
In Japan, this is one of the most important species of marine species, from which the so-called nut is produced by the drying, drying and drying of so-called nut leaves - the wages intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame - a dark green breed growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaido - is also fresh and dried and is as popular as a nut breed.
By the way, whoever doesn't know about the soup with the vaamas, it's supposed that Asian women use it as a reindeer after delivery.
And this range of effects is almost miraculous.
Cleansing blood, boosts blood circulation, even supposedly bans hair graying and is literally charged with mineral substances.
Dried and diluted wax also serves as a root, for example, for the taste of rice.
The fresh lines are first let go in the water, then soften, insert into the water and cook half a minute.
Then they cool in the cold water, cut out the middle ribs and continue to be adjusted, perhaps like a favorite salad.
However, buying it is the easiest solution.
So there is only to wrap the roll with easy vegetable filling, gentle and light, full of healthy tastes.
Such a long-term bomb.
If you give up and don't add a grilled beak.
To eat healthy, light and summer.
The Asians know how to do it.
There are only a few special raw materials and a lot of snacks, and you have interesting fresh food that combines flavors.
And it's done twice.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrot, 40 g of white order, 100 g of green cross, 60 g of salads, 60 g of wama and 60 g of sweet chili sauce.
Crank of dried coriander, black sesame spoon, cheese spoon of chilli sauce, 20 g manga and 40 g of loaded gauze, a little pine nuts.
First, we're gonna get some scissors ready.
We'll put the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we'll take her out and wait for her to faint.
In the meantime, in hot water, we will soon take out Christ’s exhumations, about three minutes after which we will allow them to cool quickly into the cold water so that they do not lose their color.
We put the green paper in and we pack it.
We make full of white radishes, carrots and salads, which we put on soft noodles, we mix them with sweet chili sauce, we add dried coriander, we mix thoroughly and we put on rice paper.
On the banana leaf, we put the crucifixes, add the candles, and finally, we get a lot of wham, loaded with a tinkling, a manga dish, a black sauce, and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must satisfy silver in its seventh ass, Fiji takes gold
The powerful performance of the United Kingdom in the week-long race ended with an end to the last obstacle, Fiji defeated in the final match on Thursday night at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio at 43:7.
The Fijians taught the master's lesson in processing, puzzles, motions, support games, running on lain and brutal forces - and won gold, their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came with an unparalleled price of comfort in the form of silver medals - for Britain on the third day - and the British could be at their performances in the opening Olympic tournament of the seven - tribe hero, conquered New Zealand, Argentina, and the South African Republic.
A winning victory over South Africa 7:5 in the seminal on the same day , may have frozen in the final.
Of course, Fiji would also beat a 15-member team in full health.
At least for the British, they won't be comfortable, but they can be happy that at least one of them will have a gold medal around their neck tomorrow: the main fan of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, the former chief of England from Wimbledon.
The Great Britain has hit a piece of the road.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost every match in Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one here.
This defeat hurts, but progress is irreparable.
Fiji began a great deal, British promenades reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and other associates, it was like running for a series of buses in motion and world Cup champions led 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau was late in the corner.
The clock showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing, from which the conversion was made.
12:0 and Britain hit the ball hard.
Great Mitchell tried to stop huge Leon Nakarawa and stop him from scored third, but only Fijian slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalu hitdown into the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another one after the return and the hours still remained more than 1 minute... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravo then penetrated the tiny British and joined the shit where he scored.
After the conversion to line 29:0, the break followed.
It was as if Fiji was born for the 7s, while the British were still learning the surrender.
That's exactly how it is.
After the British had made a mass change and the efforts of the Fijians had stopped... for the entire four minutes, which compared to the first half was good until the brilliant midway between Fiji Joshua Tuis continued.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, threw the touchdown into the left corner to increase and 36:7. But the victory had long been won by the inhabitants of the Pacific islands and their fans on the ossuary sang, had flagged and danced.
It was difficult not to admire the totally gratified attitude of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame still tried another attempt to win the Fijian.
The writer called, the Fijians hugged, and the British fell on the lawn full of excitement.
Earlier that same day Fiji defeated Japan 20:5 and Britain defeated the South African Republic in a close semi-final - in contrast to one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his robust work, broke the defense line and scored the second half under the hook.
Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother from the 15th England team, made a win - and finally also a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning's for victory at the Velsary race inspired the fight of coach with cancer
You won't find more emotional gold in these games - and that's what you say.
From the first to the last, during the 220 containing expenditures in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another significance in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Although two were happy, there were three voices in the ship. When the ship lit the second Olympic gold behind it in the women's race, there was still the voice of coach Robin Williams in the ship with them. They are the first women in the history of British sports who achieved such a result.
Their weight was absolute, in total it was their 39th race, in which they remained unresolved.
What we see - two excellent athletes, as they fly along the water level with the elegance of the labyrinth - does not reflect the nature of the victory completely.
For every gold medal from wearing is a battalion with helpful hands, which a piece after a piece means difference. And no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who did not know if he was alive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to his words, it was inconvenient.
I've had cancer of the bladder that can be operated, and I've undergone this operation.
Without an operation, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
Somehow it'll change your view of the thing.
Cancer was discovered to Williams in December 2013.
Fortunately for the whole trio it was possible to get treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, and to reduce the accident to a minimum - if we can call it under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together fast.
That's what it was for.
I was in the hospital and I went to the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time when they said a few steps were enough.
That's how it started.
Vesting itself is a journey, but this was more challenging.
Immediately after winning, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to control his own discomfort.
Stanning, the captain of the Royal College's pool, who has a mission to Afghanistan, said: "This week I was with emotions at the bottom, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much."
Again, it emphasizes how much it means to me, how much Helen and Robin and I worked together.
So far, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so he's got a huge thank-you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't wish for a better man to train or a better bitch.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
Two of them had an amazing rhythm that their rivals could not balance.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began approaching, Stanningová had a very large reserve.
We've been focusing at the very moment.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to let go.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we didn't try to achieve anything famous.
We didn't enjoy the fire department today, we just wanted to get a good hangover, go out and win the race, which we were happy to win.
We'll take two years to think before they decide what's to go on.
Glover's getting married next week, and she's a TV fan of Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was gonna be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to find out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
I feel much better about it," she said.

Prison?
Rather than driving people for free, the taximan Rubes says he's a taxi driver to a break-in.
Six taxi drivers and the former magistrate's official in Prague are, as CT said, a complaint.
You have made a series of reports in which you have discovered misleading practices and those that are to be in the group that will be held before the court.
You've been dealing with a couple of unpleasant leaks with exposed actors.
How much is the report about complaining to members of the organised group?
I was waiting for some court to come.
I'm mostly curious about judgment.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
It's nothing.
Primarily they should return all the stolen money.
And they should get them back so that they'll drive all the people free.
That's kind of a cool solution.
Does this mean, then, that you do not view the punishment as effective enough?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so scared that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one makes a brush, the other weighs the pizza, and one's completely screwed up on it.
Indictees can theoretically receive two to eight years of imprisonment.
Do you think it's an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with the deprivation of liberty.
I think it's a bad punishment.
To put someone in prison, especially in this case, is nonsense.
Such people should return to the companies that took her.
The fourth century saw the destruction of our land and the theft of the people.
So let's make a good visit now and let's get people out of here for free.
I can't imagine.
It would work as a public job.
As someone goes to collect the waste, they get a car and they'll drive people to Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll finally get a condition and they don't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ondříčka Film Academy in Pisa and then at the University of Tomáš Bati in Zlín.
It belongs to people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for Internet TV Stream.cz, where he participates in a series of series, now prepares the Prague Guide series, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
The Rubes, in the form of short reports, advises what services to avoid in Prague and what the contrary is recommended to use without fear.
He used to film a series called How to, City of Fame?, Life in luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Prague.
In the complaint, they are referred to as an organized group.
The police followed her for months.
Can such a network of fake taxi drivers be identified as a mafia?
They're such cute mafia people, not as we know from Kmotra.
It's more about the mafia -- juniors, but the organized are sure.
It's just that they're looking after each other.
Dust's all broken up.
I noticed, for example, that the main station does not like Paris, that it does not like Paris again with taxi drivers waiting for Karl's Lázní (disco club)
Everyone just keeps an eye on their place, and every group is kind of organized.
It's probably a complex network.
But there are only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate who warned the driver against the controls.
As you're saying, the unwanted shows didn't disappear from the street.
So, what percentage of Prague fraudrs in the taxi service according to your estimate is going to be?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still.
I'm talking about Alex Ryacz.
It's a man who's really dangerous - in his car he rides telescopic shoes, and every Friday and Saturday he stands at Karl's bridge and drives people.
Last time I went with him, he wanted me for seven hundred miles.
His police didn't stop for any reason.
Only a few people from all over the big group were selected.
The same is true in other places in Prague.
Thus, it is difficult for seven people to clear the already pronounced Prague mess, which seems to have much bigger dimensions.
Of course it's nothing.
It's gonna help, but all the evil isn't gonna work out, that's the truth.
Are there taxi drivers who steal foreign tourists still in the same places that you showed in the reports, that is, at Karl's bridge or in the Paris street?
Yeah, that's right.
They stand in these locations every day, and every day they break the statements.
He ignores both the city police and the Prague magistrate.
It's no longer a cockroach, but it's a total blizzard.
Business of Prague taxis in numbers
Even so, some of them, if it's only a part of the group, will be brought before the court.
It's already a break.
So I have to ask myself, do you feel satisfaction?
If I were to take it as a matter of fact, it would be wrong, because it was my goal, and it would always be to improve the centre of Prague.
And even if I feel it's a little bit better, I'll keep going.
You need to press the door on the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to get rid of him.
You can't take it easy.
But it's not like that, of course, there's more.
Are you still trying to confront them directly in taxis?
Sometimes I do a test ride and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week I caught a cab driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He taught 560 crowns in three kilometers, although he then claimed that it was 56 crowns (using a ten - wheeled trick).
He was on the line, the police arrived, and this cab driver was so excited that he was still following those cops and asked them when someone finally gave him those 56 crowns.
A similar case.
A taxi driver on the taximeter has placed a ten - page card and stole tourists with 357 crowns.
Is it said that the rage of the subversive taxi drivers did not rise even after you showed the faces of those who counted the foolish amounts for a short ride?
Their rage is still incredible.
How'd it go with that cab driver with 56 crowns?
The police sent him away because they couldn't discuss him on the spot because he had a bill.
And that's, I think, a problem with the court (six taxi drivers and one ex-contractor).
On the one hand, there will be a taxi driver with his bills, on the other hand, the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the magistrate shall not use the secret records of the taxi service vehicle as evidence at the court.
When I filmed the stories about their frauds, the taxi drivers themselves warned me about this precedent.
I've been taking pictures, but I've always wanted to use it in the report.
Are you worried that this fact could protect them from trial?
I hope every judge will understand that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten miles because he would not live on it.
You've been talking about a trick with a ten-card card, especially in front of foreign clients.
Is it still current, or are they worried about using this figure after publishing your reports?
I think we've been popularizing this trick by sending out a series.
Recently I was driving with a cab driver, boasting in front of me that he was the honest cab driver.
Then I noticed that the black glue was attached to the taximeter.
When I asked him what it was like, he said, "You know what it is."
If the taximen were not working too well, could they be warned by the court with their colleagues?
Is there anything that can fool them?
You've been talking about the way you think you're going to cheat, they'll always find you.
I don't think there's anything you can do about it.
But someone can push them out of these places.
And they're fair cab drivers who should work more to get them out of there really.
From my experience, I have to say that these fair cab drivers in Prague are fortunately considering.
But are they willing to go against those who punish the reputation of their service?
They've got a taste, but they're missing their mind.
They can't go into it and they can't say exactly what they want.
When they arranged this demonstration (due to the proposal for a total restriction from the office of Prime Minister Adriana Krnáčov), it was not very clear what they actually wanted.
Once they said they didn't protest against Uber, that they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It happened that they were just blocking Prague and creating only the best possible commercial for Uber.
How do you fully assess the approach of the Prague magistrate to solve the problem of driving?
It's obvious that she had to go into this until the criminal police came in to make a deal.
The magistrate was short on it.
They had a receipt card there, which means that the cab department had been doing its job for several years completely unnecessary.
I hope that this official will be charged with the final check of all the tired checks to know what he's done.
That's the worst thing I'm gonna find out.
I was even with him on a check-in ride, which I found out after their appointment.
A few months have passed since the last part of the series was published.
What's the answer?
I'm thinking mainly of foreign viewers, unless the series is actually the most focused.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I'll release the video to them.
And then when we're going to the Old Town Square, it's a surprise that the same people who are seeing the footage are really standing there.
Infamous Prague Celebrates.
But seriously.
I'd build the fences around them to get people to look at them.
Museum of Communism directly on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you drive a cab when you need it?
Sure.
I'm on my way to services where I don't have to pay cash, but with a card.
I use services such as Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there's also a lot of dyspepsia that's fair.
I've only taken a cab on the street since then.
The driver told me after the car's show, "Well, you've got the courage."
I'll be in a dress for an Italian tourist.
It has already been written about the fraudulent practices of the taxi drivers in 2005.
In that year, a former Prime Minister, Paul Bem, went on a check-in trip to be dressed as an Italian tourist, and immediately to his first attempt, his driver had two hundred.
But editor Rubes had worse experience.
The taxi drivers taught him to drive from Old Town to Václav Square 820 kroner, which is about 195 kroner per km, as reported by the reporters.
The Prague magistrate then set a maximum price of 28 kroner per kilometer.
The report also includes other surprising amounts: for example, a two-kilometer road from the streets of Paris to the Trohlářský stała tourist 400 kroner.
The expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at the Karl Bridge.
For a ride to Angel, which is 2.5 kilometers away, you have to charge six and a half crowns.
The marble is washed mostly with clean water, the most unchemistry and the longer the better.
Its impurities go well, although sometimes the dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it has to be removed from the barrier.
It's not easy and it's not going fast, it's getting close to the work of Vanessa Trost from Oldrich in The Hague.
A hole down in front of it: the tomb is built by a sinking, after which it is necessary to go out and descend again.
"The restaurant should be careful, patient and unsatisfying in the working environment," she noted.
In Friedlantsk, it's not far from her first restoration work.
Thanks to her restorations, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the back of the Friedlant Council, she also restored the remains of St. Mary Magdalena in Zatiš, St. John Nepomucky in Friedlant, Piet in Friedlant County Street, Mariana column in Friedlant or atlants in contrast with the spa in the New City under Smrk.
With the refurbishment of Melchiora, Krystofa and Katerina from Rederna, Frydlanta began in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleansed from the wear of uncleanness and the cross, the loose parts of the stone will be protected against falling and moving; either into the wall or against each other.
It is also waiting for treatment and preservation of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be laid again.
"Then it begins with the freezing of inscriptions on marble boards with sharp plated gold," the reference to the State monumental care of the city office in Frydlant Věr Sobotová.
There's no record from the past that the tomb would have been repaired.
In a closer look, they'll take the openings drawn in marble columns.
They're hundreds of years old and it's about the remains after the funeral.
He was richly decorated. Unfortunately, after the Swedish trip to the Thirty Years Wars, everything went away.
They literally looked at the tomb, marked Sobot.
In the church of the founding of the Holy Cross there are restaurants with a small surface like home.
After the flood in 2010, there was a need to put in order the burials that were made under the water, the churches were restored, the wall paintings in the tomb, and now the tomb.
"We would also like to leave ourselves in the window in the future," Sobot said.
The church is in a very good state, every year to maintain and repair money.
The restoration of the refurbishment of the refurbishment site will total 128 thousand crowns.
They will be threatened by grants, the city will not deposit any of its money in this part of the renovation.
A hundred thousand crowns will come from the victory in the district round of the historic city of 2015, the remaining 28,000 crowns are then the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, explained by Mayor Frydlanta Dan Ramzer.
A representative decided to set up a Retirement Award for the Retirement of the Retirement.
Opinions of experts on future developments in selected foreign markets followed by indices and comparison with the Czech Capital Market (PX) in the horizon of one month and a half years.
Low volatility and growth prevail in the markets.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year.
The American S&P500 index, which went through 12% of the corrections in February, is today at the new historical maximum and has already signed 7% since the beginning of the year.
Again, the iron rule is confirmed that traders should never go against the interests of central banks, which have finally reached their own.
In a situation where US shares are at the historical maximum again, the volatility mix, which is currently at the lowest since 2014, when markets grew peacefully and without fear due to the quantitative release of the US Central Bank and when, like today, the Volatility Index (VIX) remained stable below the 12 per cent threshold.
And don't be.
Although the Fed market continues to prepare for a gradual increase in interest rates, the quantitative release in Europe and Japan is in full flow and last week has also joined the Bank of England, which will purchase 70 billion bonds in the next six months.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative release is already pushing so low outputs even below and contributes to almost complete elimination of risk and fear from the future.
How long will this condition last?
That's, of course, a million question.
At the moment, however, there are no risks, the world economy is experiencing almost constant growth without major increases, the situation in the commodity market and China is stabilised and the brexit is no longer essentially a topic, so we should not be too surprised if, in a similar peaceful regime, American action continued.
It's a shame Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I'm very glad my friend Michel Barnier took on this important and challenging task.
I wanted to declare this difficult work of the experienced policy, the head of the European Commission Juncker, when the French policy (actually experienced, because the vast majority of the most diverse international political functions, that we would look for a better example of the so-called European elite), has appointed the European Commission's chief negotiator the terms of departure from the United Kingdom.
Juncker's election sparked the signs that it is in the EU's serious interest to look for a form of future friendship coexistence with Britain.
Most British media, however, adopted the name Barnier as Junker's war act.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
The Great Britain hates it.
As a European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009 - 2014), he was concerned about the reform of European banking law.
He explained it as he could only understand it: a hardened enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of free market and the model of capitalism.
The existence of multilateral regulation was a co-author of the concept of the so-called banking union, and is in favour of all that comes from the London City Financial Centre, which has passed legislation over the cross-border regulation of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, unobtrusive, and probably even an independent negotiator.
That's probably not a good news.
How in this context do you not recall the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovakian Federation, to which the distinction, review and capacity of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed.
That is why today the Czechs can be the closest friends and allies.
It's a shame that Juncker from Václav Klaus - at least in this - didn't learn.
It'd be good for everyone!
Earthquakes around Putin?
Governor Kremlu missed his close Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin missed Sergei Ivanov on Friday from the post of head of the President's office.
Let's take his place, Anton Waryno.
She informed the Russian media about this by calling for Kremlu's press release.
Putin then indicated Ivanov's going to drop on his own request.
At a meeting held on the 24th TV station of Rossija, the president said that Ivanov's wish to be the head of the president's office for a maximum of four years was met.
At the same time, he announced Ivanov would be his special representative for the environment and transport.
The report on the exchange in front of the President of the administration, which is now taking over Ivanov's current representative of Vajno, is considered rather surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is one of the closest collaborators to Putin.
This former KGB officer in the past, for example, has stopped the Minister of Defence and the Vice-President of the Government.
The President's seat on the Security Council will also be left.
Ivanov, at his meeting with Putin, stated that he was a long-term director in the head of the state's administration as a recordman.
He lasted in it for four years and eight months.
In this regard, he recalled that 11 people had already been disfellowshipped within 25 years of its establishment.

The half-way success in the morning program in Rio was recorded in the Czech text: skier Ondřij Synek won his semi-finals with a review, when the second Damira Martina from Croatia defeated even after his release in almost a second.
Today, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as I could, I brought in the Son.
His opponents, unlike him, had to fight about the procedure.
So it's got some power on them, so it could be easier on them tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's gonna be easy, it's just playing in my cart, the Prague Dukly messenger declared.
Myrka Topinkova-Knapkova, but she didn't walk in the Snow Whites.
A five-year-old midwife sat in today's semifinals in her fourth position on Saturday, waiting for her start at the B finals and a fight from 7th to 12th.
The gold from London doesn't do that.
I didn't go to the finals for the first time at the Olympics.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I ran a quality race, and I put everything that went on.
The rivals were just better, and they were left in front of the Topin's button.
She fought to the end and believed that in her fourth games she'd get between elite sixties.
Fight gave up right ahead of target.
I knew the girls were balanced, that anyone could get out of this field.
I was surprised by the Chinese that she had such a finish.
And I thought I could go to the finals through the Rakušanka.
Unfortunately, today's life race, the 2011 World Championships said.
Far behind the final gates in Rio, a young shooter, Philip Nepeichal, who has not been able to escape from the qualifications this time in bed.
Nepeichal had 33th place in it.
Qualifications are the best for the Russians.
From the first dot, Sergei Kamenskij was placed with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
Nepeichal's gun had a value of 620.5 points.
For the first time in Rio, the athletes, including the Czech seven-man Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučina, also talked about the program.
The Cachs belong to the 11th place after the second discipline of the Olympic competition, the Czech recordman Eliška Klučinová is twelve.

Both of them took care of the historical best performance in the course of the seven.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters, but they didn't make it.
German, Russian, who's worse?
When we look at the absurdity of the question, the German society has gone through a deep self-respect, where Russia is not.
In both large European nations, dictators emerged in the 20th century, and they became powerless by regimes that were non-human, brutal and terrible.
From 1917 to 1989, Russian Bolsheviks have contributed a great deal to the 94 million victims of communism, which the Black Book of communism, whether it was a daily individual repression, targeted hunger, inadequate war management or non-human experiments.
In a non - Nazi way, about 6 million Jews were hungry, and the total victims of World War II were estimated to be 60 million.
In occupied or abandoned territories, the Germans and the Soviets carried out the superstitions.
In Germany and the USSR, only a few individuals were convicted, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes, whether actively, passively or simply by cutting their heads in the sand.
It's not just the specificity of these nations, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, the immediate end of the war came denouncing, the Nuremberg court.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask: "Daddy, Grandpa, why did you participate in such rituals?
How could you?
This has brought true reflection and healing to society.
Germany's elites have been taking care of the country's prosperity, the elimination of poverty, the welfare of its citizens.
Now they also have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but certainly they can't connect them back to Alaska-Lotrinsko or anyone - to revans - military attack - it may be recognized by everyone.
After the cold war in Russia, no great reflection came.
The window of possible positive changes was definitely closed at the turn of the millennium when the former KGB officer (sic!)Vladimir Putin came to power.
Often criminal history is celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putinovski Russia is remunerated, the acquisition of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
The health, prosperity and the future of their own people is not worth it to the believer.
Fight yours, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only those decades of despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally minority - destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
To whom does the increase in tension around Crimea increase?
Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russia border in Crimea has deteriorated.
To whom does the increase in stress benefit?
After a long period of relative peace, there was another deterioration in relations between Ukraine and Russia.
The Ukrainian side's prison became the Krym peninsula, which was connected more than 2 years ago to Russia and is part of its territory.
Of course, reports from both sides of the enemy are contradictory and it is difficult to verify them independently, and so we have only an opportunity to think about an old known question to whom?
According to reports from Moscow, terrorist attacks on Krym have occurred on the Ukrainian side, which Ukraine, of course, rejects and blames Kreml for provocation.
Information on the arrest of members of Ukrainian special units in Russia has already come from the case of the pilot Savchenké known answer that they were allegedly kidnapped in the territory of Russia.
If we were to join the Ukrainian version, what would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is nothing.
The escalation of tension around Crimea can only harm Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further sanctioning and strengthening the anti-Russia campaign.
In recent years, the background of the immigration crisis to Europe has been shifting attention from the situation in Ukraine.
Ukraine's leadership has already lost all credit in front of its inhabitants, when the current support of President Porošenko moves around 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have long since bankrupted to be not a cheap EU financial injection, and especially the IMF.
In this situation, it is necessary for the Ukrainian regime to refocus on its country so as to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation before voters in its country.
President Porošenko and other members of the executive board of the strengths again want to be seen as strong men who are afraid to build a large Russia.
It is only hoped that all those who are trying to resolve the open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally recognize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers but all ordinary people on both sides of the enemy and stop their enemy actions.
Bulgaria first showed inflation in eight months
According to national statistics, inflation reached 1 % in Bulgaria in July.
This is the highest value for several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0,2 % was published.
The annual average rate of inflation, measured by the CPI index, over the last 12 months (July 2015 – July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 – July 2015) was -0.8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101,0 % and monthly inflation was 1,0 %.
The inflation rate from the beginning of the year (June 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2 % and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 versus July 2015 was -0.2 %.
Against the background of the previous month, in July 2016, the road to the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and regular maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as last month, prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education remained.
The U.S. secret services watched the Russian hacker attacks last year.
Information on Russian attacks was received to the public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was engaged in an attack on the servers of the side centre of the Democrats.
But no official report is mentioned on the Russian attack.
Moscow's involvement in the attack has been denied.
The report on the monitoring of the alleged Russian attack was extremely secret, because its expression would show that US secret services monitor and reveal the hacker attack could also be the way they do it and the resources they use.
Two Russian intelligence services were involved in the attack.
New Advisory Body for Cybersecurity
The Russian track monitoring material was coded and had access to it only a small group of experts, wrote Reuters.
Only a small group of eight delegates from Congress, called the U.S. gang, were informed.
It is composed of both the chief chamber of Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the presidents of both the chambers of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the Congress' defence and security committees.
The Head of Democratic Party Donna Brazil announced Thursday that he is setting up an advisory body for cyber security, which is to "stop future attacks and ensure the first-class protection of the servers of the Democratic Party".
There was a dangerous parasite in the recognized salmon from Albert.
The network apologized.
On the basis of the initiative, consumers on health problems after consumption of food Losos wildly recognized - pieces 100 g, date of consumption 22.11.2016 carried out checks in the sales of Albert in Václavje na městka and Na Městka.
The verification found that batches L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, on which the customer notified no longer available, and therefore the product of the identical batch was obtained with the date of consumption 11.12.2016.
The laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It's a parasitic worm of the trachea of the marine mammals.
This is dangerous for a man - larvae in the body’s chest or muscle fish are a strong allergen, and man - born live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, Štich said.
We apologize very much to customers for the problems of this brand.
We immediately withdrew the stock from the sale and for preventive reasons we also downloaded all the other stocks of this item.
There was a doubt on the side of the supplier we are dealing with, and at the same time we left this product to test ourselves, said Newsman Albert Barbor Vanko.
If the customer bought this product, he can return it to any of the chain stores and get the money back.
The larvae destroys the frost and sufficient heat adjustment
The seller was the company Nekton - Vrňata.
Hygienics were informed of the existence of a dangerous product by the authorities of Prague and the Mediterranean veterinary administration.
According to the food safety server, people after exposure to parasites may be ill with anisaciosis, which occurs with acute abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or disease can occur without signs, the CHK has indicated.
Symptoms will be delivered within an hour to two weeks after consumption of insufficiently treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the beginning of the larvae’s disease, most spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to higher and lower temperatures, so they are killed either in sufficient heat processing of fish meat or in freezing it.
At the time, the veterinarians also checked salmon at the recipient of imported goods in the Mediterranean region.
Three of the five samples examined had parasites in them.
The supplier arrived in the Czech Republic in 1700 according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) at the beginning of April.
It was shipped, in general, to the Ahold chain, to this day 919 packages.
At present, unsold stocks of product from sales are being downloaded, SVS spokesperson Petr Peichal said on Friday.
Immediately after finding positive samples, the veterinarians prohibited the dispatch of other products from the consignment.
Seventeen-year-old Britka wanted to get out of Rakka, apparently killed her by a Russian raid.
After the initial excitement and the quick match with the jihadite who was killed by the dragons, there was an excrement.
For British girls, the expected paradise of chalice turned into hell on earth, from which there was no escape.
The girl was related to her sister Halimo.
She called Britain again and she believed she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic state is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They have no intention of shooting, quoted The Telegraph family lawyer as the dead girl Tasnim Akunjee.
The last tracks led to Rakka, from where the girl called last.
Then there's only a report about her death, but she can't verify it.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in eastern London.
Together they discussed how they could get from Rocky and cross the Turkish border.
That's where they hoped to meet the former student again.
Kadiza, however, was probably killed before she could escape because the house where she was staying had been compared to the country in May, the British ITV News reported.
She added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane that attacked the IS garden in Syria.
You'd be wearing blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer.
In a week when (Kadiza) thought about escape from the territory of the Islamic State, one Rakušanka was arrested while trying to escape and, according to the information available, was publicly killed to death.
I think that (Kadiza) has put it out as a warning and decided to get nervous, according to the BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with 15-year-old friends from Shamimo Begu and Amir Abas, were released on February 17th last year.
The only thing they said at home was they were going out.
But they headed to Gatwick airport and from it across Turkey to the territory of IS.
The family of the girl according to the lawyer did everything in her power to get Cadiz back.
You would take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area and this family would do everything she could to make every effort to get her daughter home.
But it wasn't possible without the risk of being caught by a lawyer himself.
The only positive thing he thinks is that Kadizy's fate can serve as a frightening case for other girls or even boys who are being fooled by Islamic propaganda.
"There are many cases when people left there, they realized how things were, they understood how far they were different from the promises of the propaganda of the Islamic State, and they wanted to return," Akunjee further noted.
The fate of Kadiz's associates is unknown.
Since they also remained silent, their families must be at peace with the fact that they are most likely to be dead.
To prison for money.
In Scotland, you can go for a net without committing a crime.
For many centuries, Inveraray was the town center and the capital of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the 18th century, the court has been held at the council, and the subterranean has served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the prisoners lived were sad and many prisoners tried to escape.
Many of them were successful.
Therefore, the city representatives decided to move the prison facilities to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more attractive, warm and gas lighting for prisoners.
It had not been in operation for a long time, and it had been closed for economic reasons since the end of August 1889, since smaller repair facilities were costly to operate and did not pay too much.
The stories of the prisoners and the ghost hunt.
For the public, the prison opened up centuries later, visitors can compare the old building to a new building to convince themselves of the different conditions in which they were mastering it.
Guides in ancient costumes are still strengthening the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room where visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to the offenders, whether it was the grinding of the fingers or the burning of the marks on the body.
During the tour, tourists may be confined to one of the goals, mostly because of the photo on the memory, or to guide themselves to the sense that the prisoners live behind the network.
By the way, the Inveraray prison is one of the most famous Scottish sites where she is supposed to be afraid.
There have already been a number of groups of paranormal hunters, and today the museum allows people to come to catch some ghosts.
That night, however, will amount to 300 pounds, which is estimated to be about 9500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also enjoys great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
"Anime" effect on Snapchat is criticised as Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
The Snapchat app enables about 150 million users to change reality every day and to play with the identity of ways that border with absurdity.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog or a figure that looks like it came out of Roy Lichtenstein's image.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfics every day.
Any mistake will be made immediately.
Snapchat's filters in the past have served a criticism of the fact that the application promotes blackfaceding or that it supports white shades of skin as an ideal beauty.
So when this week offered users a filter, which made them look ugly, curved teeth and smoldering faces, some critics called it the racist character of the Asians - "yellowface."
And they were wondering if these repeated controversial questions did not indicate a larger problem for society - a problem with diversity.
On Wednesday Verge and Motherboard wrote and the news and expansion spread rapidly and Snapchat immediately indicated that the function had been interrupted.
The company offered an explanation: Filter was meant as an expression of account I make an animated, not as an Asian cartoon.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter recalled painful stereotypes in action.
The rest of the unscathed compared to the souls refused.
Grace Sparpani, a student of American art from Korea, whose photo tweet was widely shared, stated in the e-mail that the filter was “at least harmful and embarrassing.”
She added that “it is difficult to argue against comparing the obvious Asian character and filter effects.
It is shown that the filter is not only about the yellowface but that the yellow face is affected to the smooth end.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
It seems that American culture has an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from the sessions in corporations after Hollywood and the equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And the huge number of young people in Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - can mean that you can expect even greater sensitivity.
"When one Snapchat filter creates a picture that is offensive to some user," said fifty-five Katie Zhu on Thursday in the conversation, "but these things are very difficult today without notice, as it used to be."
Katie Zhuová, the product manager and designer who works for the Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her account on Snapchat and urged others to do the same.
In the article for the Media and in the telephone interview, she stated that she was convinced that racially motivated problems reflected a lack of diversity in the recruitment of workers in Snapchat.
Katie Zhuová criticised the overwhelming white, completely male management of the company and the article included hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's like they don't have any diversity and color people between employees at the moment they decide on these things," said Zhuová, who has Chinese-American origin, "or color people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or pleasant to talk about."
Other observers share her opinion - the complaint that Snapchat left unresponsibly.
The company does not publish the figures relating to the diversity of its employees by having a private company.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of his employees, but according to the spokesperson, she recently adopted a recruitment worker who should focus on insufficiently represented population and internal management.
Zhuová adds: “I’m curious if other users really need to say that it’s not okay, ” with their account being cancelled.
Military officials have outlined the reporting information on IS, the parliamentary committee says
The parliamentary committee stated in its report on Thursday that the officials of the United States Central Authority had changed the reports of the intelligence service to reflect a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than they had provided from the country.
According to the preliminary report of the Working Group drawn up by the President of the Committee on Armed Forces, the Committee on Reporting Services and the Sub-Committee on Defence, a "extensive dissatisfaction" was found between the analysts of the Central Reporting Service, which changed their position in the US to defeat the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is an army headquarters in Tampea, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press statement states: “The results of the secret services approved by the senior officials of Centcom usually offered a more positive picture of the counter-terrorism efforts of the United States than those confirmed by the facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than the analyses obtained from other parts of the reporting community.”
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are injured when the above-mentioned policy makers are subjected to a misanalysis," said Ken Calvert, Congressman and Republican of California.
The error in Centcom's leadership reaches the top of the organization.
The ten-page report details the continuing problems of the Central Staff in describing and analysing American efforts in training the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although no decisive evidence is available that the senior representatives of Obama's administrative authorities ordered the reports to be amended, it is noted that the analysts felt that they were pressured by Centcom's leaders to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State or the IS.
“In the first half of 2015, many press reports from the central staff, statements and statements from the congress were significantly more positive than what events were really happening”, the report states.
For example, the representative of Centcom publicly announced that a major military attack on the takeover of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is quite clear after months of investigation," said Mr Pompeo, representative of the Republic of Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest position staff of the U.S. central reporting staff have manipulated the staff with reports from the staff with a view to baggageing the dangerous IS in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a working group after learning about the concerns of analysts that information on the Islamic State's reporting services is being manipulated.
Following the report published on Thursday, further examinations must be followed.
In Centcom's reporting services, further investigations are being carried out by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the Committee on Reporting Services published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the Working Group of the Republicans.
"between 2014 and 2015 Centcom has created a very close process for the compilation of the evaluation of information on IS and the Iraqi security components," said representative Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and the representative of the Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, this process "leaded to the conversion of the outputs of the reporting services", damaged the morale between analysts and "inadequately taken into account the inconsistencies".
However, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they did not find any evidence that the White House would try to press on Centcom analysts to correct their conclusions according to the "proposal or political situation."
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last July, the New York Times reported on the ongoing investigation of Inspector General Pentagon, which was initiated following the complaints of the analysts of Centcom.
Commander Patrick Evans, a speaker in the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the parliamentary report because the investigation of the Inspector General is still continuing.
He stated, however, that "the experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex data, and that the reporting community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation has an impact on the scope of the question whether the Americans led bombing in Iraq and Syria is successful (the verdict now declaring the increasing number of defence representatives).
However, last year's indictment raised questions as to the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central staff to evaluate the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis sites.
Reporting criticism of the Islamic State has reflected conflicts for more than ten years, when an analyst of Centcom's intelligence services, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research work stating that the administration of President George W. Bush - despite the opposition of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and spent only a little time thinking about what would follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting the Islamic state's intelligence services.
Last year, the authorities announced that the Hooker team had reached the conclusion that despite the public statement of opposition, air strikes directed against the refinery of the Islamic State had not significantly weakened the financial resources of this terrorist group, as the group had built up temporary refinery and oil sales on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings were not transmitted outside the central staff.
Commander Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticised last year after many legislators sought the Senate's testimony by too positive an assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel in Centcom.
The United States won the ground hockey in the fourth match in a row, so today will play a decisive match in the UK team
Katie Bam, in the match against Japan, who finished winning 6:1, shot three branches and only the day after the American women's team of ground hockey shot the first two branches of the match in which India 3:0 was defeated Thursday.
Five tracks in two matches were a good memory, but Bam (27) said she was not sure if something like this ever happened to her.
"I have no idea," she said.
I don't belong among those who write their branches.
But he knows this: The Americans at the Olympic tournament are leading the 4th and they are divided into the first place in the group with the Great Britain, which remained on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round.
Both teams qualified to the quarter and the game will decide which of the six teams will end in the first and the second.
The team from the first place will for a while avoid the strong Danes who are in the head of the second group.
No matter what Saturday the game ends, the Americans here caused their surprise ride, four years after they ended up among 12 teams in London.
There was a Bam on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took a hockey to ground hockey first when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player at all.
The 2008 Olympics escaped her because she did not get to the final match.
Then came the year 2012, when neither she nor the members of her team had much to do.
Next year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," said Bamová.
In London, we didn't have the rate of work we have today.
We've made a full turn.
On Thursday night, Bam began the first half of the shooting of the branch known as closeness.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved to be surprisingly hard and kept score 1:0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam used the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then called in the middle and shot the ball in the white to get the Americans to lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last branch in half a quarter.
The removal of the American barrister, Jackie Briggs, who in each of the three winnings helped one brand, was at least the first at the tournament.
It's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
"Now we're in a good place," Parnham said, but how good it is, it's going to be the result of the Saturday match.
Zen trampoline in the middle of the Olympic Biking
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - it's an Olympic.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro, it is felt that competition and effort are persistent, unfathomable and busy.
It's like the Olympic descent itself would be a hot barbque that's passed by the swimmer, the gymnast, and the triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then it's Logan Dooley, too.
Dooley, the incoming lovely woman with a doll in her face, is at the first Olympics and could also be among those whose name will be known in the homes in the main broadcast time between advertising and sponsoring meetings, if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even a screenwriter.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest in California fights for the Olympic gold in the jumps on the trampoline.
The Olympic Fire doesn't light up all the competitions anyway.
Far from Wednesday, a little in the shadows are sports that are not generally recognized: firearms, firearms, badminton, taekvondo.
We'll always be successful in a classic swim style - and we'll probably rule for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me point to the unmistakable magic of trampoline.
Although there are jumps on the Olympic trampoline since 2000, when they were first introduced to games in Sydney, after 16 years of intervention, this sport remains almost unnoticed - many people I questioned, even didn't know it was Olympic sport.
It could be regional greed.
The United States never won a medal in the trampoline jumps and none of the athletes even reached the finals by 2012.
Prices in the male category are usually shared between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year gold medals from London will cover Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
The jumps on the trampoline, however, have a further weakness, partly because the unencumbered ear will seem to be more suitable at the clown university than at the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, but just a fan of the country.
It has a comical potential - a comical vibration of infinite reflection - but also the warmth of gymnastics and diving, two sports that combine in it.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish word "el trampoline", which means "skokanska board".
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to a height of almost 10 meters and perform compositions with several elements (salt, heat and combination) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to implementation, difficulties and "air times".
In Rio, he will compete for twenty-seven athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The usual trail of the Olympic route is ahead.
Soldiers of gold medals must go further, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, again and again, up and down.
Not only is he trying to reach the target tape or start-up wall, but, as TV news reports say, another line of thought: a world record or an Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, wonderful, a little fanatical - and enough to bring the spectators to tears.
But I think it's a little exhausting when you're watching the Olympics.
Jumps to the trampoline in this respect bring the flow.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is heading up.
It doesn't mean it's moving forward.
He or she looks like they're in a state of no weight like astronauts, they're flying up, then down, and then they're back up.
Without competition and, of course, no difficulties can do this, but after the duration of the composition, there will be no vicious struggle to achieve a goal, no detachment of distance, but only a perfect, smooth delivery of time and gravity.
This is only the closest when the olympiad and the zen are approaching.
Qualifications and finals of women take place on Friday afternoon, 13 hours east time, then male competition on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will send the finals within the afternoon block, which starts after both days in 14 hours.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise peaceful, pleasant moments that you will probably see through the other battles.
And if the attention is to be achieved only so that men's athletes will be the subject of loving views and disappointments - as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by the gymnasium USA - then Logan Dooley is waiting only for their new fans who are crawling on the breath.
"Protesting Generation" in Ethiopia, long-term United States
Persecutive protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political changes in Ethiopia have attacked the violent resistance of the government.
Witnesses claim that many Protestants were shot during the shootings with the police.
The threat of war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade it was one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
Over the last few months, however, the country has been experiencing counter-government problems that spread to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have gone to the streets demanding fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s reaction was unmerciful.
The witnesses claim that the police have shot and killed representatives of unarmed demonstrators.
In rolling video recordings of protests likely from the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, security forces personnel are captured, as young people do after being forced to stand on the wall.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now requesting a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and to take a step forward will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, project leader Horn of Africa for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most popular nation in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the West.
The US military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to eliminate the threat of a terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and many of the African countries, if any, are receiving such assistance from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia has developed at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved in a fundamental way - in Addis Ababa's capital is even driving a new suburban train.
And the streets of the cities are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Ethiopia, however, can hardly be described as a model of democracy - an organization fighting for human rights without standing talking about government repression - the opposition in the country was suppressed, dissidents were effectively silenced.
Many were imprisoned, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the wilderness.
But that can change.
"When people are angry and they have no choice but to protest, there is a breakthrough," said Seyoum Teshome, who teaches at the university in central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all young people.
He's been protesting the whole generation.
The complaint is a lot, and it concerns all the ground disputes after absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year's elections, which have been widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies have won the last chair of the opposition and now controls 100 per cent in parliament.
At the same time, the pressure on the Eritrean border increases. The conflict along this unexplained, controversial border requested hundreds of lives in June.
Analyticals fear that separatist groups, which have been increasingly oppressed over the last few years, such as the Oromus Free Front or the Ugandan National Free Front, may try to use the confusion and rearm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why these bitter feelings have been heated again now after years of flooding under the surface.
The first one seems to be harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks up to the last few years, when they have become commonly available cheaper phones and Internet services have improved.
And even if the government prohibits access to Facebook or Twitter, as is usually the case during protests, many people can still communicate through the Internet proxy that hides the position of these people.
A number of young Ethiopians discussed how they met for protests.
There is further greater solidarity between Oromy and Amhary, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Oromas and Amhars are not natural allies.
After a long time, Amharus, mostly from the Christian peaks of Ethiopia, was distinguished in politics and commerce and used Oromas, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But it also changes.
"We are on our way to united leadership," said Mulat Gemechu, leader of the Oromas.
The biggest protests occurred in the areas of Amhary and Oroma.
Many Amharians and Oromas feel that Ethiopia is illegally dominated by the Tigris ethnic members, who make up about 6 per cent of the population and control the army, reporting services, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is the death of Meles Zenavi.
Zenavi, the former leader of the rebels, was the Ethiopian president of the government for the entire 17 years until his death in 2012, when he suffered the undetected disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see the corner.
Analysts say that in particular, he was able to detect the initial signs of discontent and use the envoys to manipulate and win the opponents on his side.
"The current regime loses fundamental consciousness," said Abdi, an analyst of the conflict.
The new President of the Government of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was removed from relative ignorance with the aim of replacing Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigris region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts claim that he does not have confidence in the security services of the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be another blood flow.
In 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts called the election that the government picked up and then stole.
He followed a hard strike during which many Protestants were killed - although less than in the past months - and this period of anxiety passed relatively quickly.
Development experts assessed Ethiopian leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
It is obvious, however, that the gradual rise in disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop it.
And there's dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month the protests in Gondar city of Amharic attacked businesses owned by the Tigers and the anti-Tigers on social networks are becoming more and more common.
Analysts say protests create an unpleasant situation in the United States and other Western allies.
The U.S. government uses Ethiopia as the basis for the transfer of drones over neighboring Somalia, although it has recently declared that the base has been closed.
While the West wants to clearly support democracy, at the same time it does not want its associate to break down in such a permanent area.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of sharpness."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and funding IS as "sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried to savor the latest controversy on Friday, which floats his campaign, declaring that he did not mean it when several times this week he insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican candidate to speak clearly to the American public.
It also puts into an unpleasant situation his instigator, who tried hard to defend him in a stormy time and must explain that he may not have thought his remarks seriously.
After this proposal for a Wednesday night meeting, Trump confirmed his statement on Thursday and continued in the talks that he really did not mean to say that the president and H. Clinton's IS had been created.
However, in a Twitter post on Friday morning, Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The contribution was the opposite of claiming the old only one day when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusation.
When conservative ad moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to mitigate the fact that Obama was trying to destroy the IS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The most recent storm comes at a time when Trump tried to focus his campaign on the economy, while his preferences in pre-election surveys declined.
Trump and Clinton took part this week in Michigan duel on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to come back to this topic again.
On Twitter he again warned that Clinton's proposals were linked to an increase in taxes, and he said her speech was boring.
Trump used his defense sarcasm earlier.
At the end of July, when he saw the wave of criticism, when he came up with the proposal that the Russians should enter Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his note: "I am of course sarcastic."
This approach to Trump allows to push the limits of political declarations and reduce them as necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing to what extent some reports have a response to his supporters to find out how they react, and then in response to one or the other way "explained," said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who was watching the language that both candidates used.
But I also think he's curious in his statements, and he knows that they're important enough to be able to explain them differently.
Because the results of pre-election research in his favor continue to decline, Trump has chosen even more costly tone in the last days instead of reducing things for general voters.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump is with a great distance behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close to her in Florida.
Trump tries to avoid excuses for provocative sentences, which he says, but often his criticism blames him for misinterpreting his words or for not understanding his sense of humor.
But together with Trump in the final months of the presidential campaign, they put Trump's jokes into the unpleasant situation of his loyal stand, which must be publicly behind him, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former Prime Minister of New York City, who is one of the most prominent Trump stairs, had to defend candidates on Thursday in the discussion for the CNN.
"I suspect that what he says is a legitimate political comment," Giuliani, when asked about Trump's credibility, stated that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that in front of Obama, IS was almost unknown, a small organization he called the newcomer completely wrong, and it came to this because his army had arrived from Iraq.
Most of the ordinary Republicans are trying to argue that Obama's government, in which Clinton acted as a foreign minister, allowed the IS to prevail and failed to deal aggressively with the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania Trump continued on Twitter, he set fire to the media because they were changing every word he said and they were busy with him.
He spoke to “the humble, pathetic ” television students who try to understand her and said, “It can’t! ”
Several Democrats have apologized to Trump for the fact that it is only further evidence that he is not eligible for the presidential office.
The coffee shop has been pushed out of the price market.
The Verb Cafe café was a rusty place in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, without Wi-Fi, but where the coffee was given for 15 years.
Of course, it came to the fact that she was pushed out of the house at Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store that Verb replaced in summer 2014 - sells soap in the form of cakes.
The locals complained about it as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabpple on Twitter wrote: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is out of control, and Verb is now a trading medium."
But if New York is a change, then it's also a rediscovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and receives payment cards, but there are some of the original employees working there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee's still good, too.
The manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the original café, who is at the same time the owner and executive director of the new place.
In Verb he started in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of his customers offered him to pay for the move to a new place, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same oven supplier and bought the same model machine on espresso.
He even again used the lights from the old Verb.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new, too.
He started using new bets.
In the offer are sandwiches with ham, egg and cheese and toppings, such as caps and fried onion.
You'll also find some rice noodles here.
The coffee doesn't supply beer anymore, but it'll offer you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady flow of original strains.
"A number of original customers from Williamsburg also had to move for prices," he said.
Last week there was one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveirov.
Mrs. Oliveirová (34) lived in Williamsburg, and at Verb Cafe she often walked.
She even came when the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out that what I like is coffee and culture in Verba," she said.
Now he's drinking coffee again, but on that day, instead of his usual ice coffee, he gave himself a mixed chai, another novel.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-term customer, has been on his way to Verb since 2003.
He goes before work and always orders the same thing.
"In the fourth and eighth days, I will come as clocks, and they will prepare my mouth with everything and butter for me," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add to the offer of a new bet.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what's usual, but sometimes on his lips he lets all the bacon, eggs and ham.
Rodriguez said he's not sorry that the soap shop took his old place.
The truth is, the owners of Soap Cherie offered him that he would make a special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the coffee shop as a substitute.
"I think we could still use it," said Rodriguez.
The traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint also welcomed the coffee shop.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would soon be exposed to the new neighbors here to feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
Local fruit growers want to tap into the bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is a possibility that the café will expand into a neighboring building.
A lot of customers have enough to get back their old favorite.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee shop closed, he broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that once the cafe opened up again, coming in and having coffee is like coming home.
"I missed that smell," he said.
Depressive food from the time of the crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after arriving at the office of president in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval work and lunch.
President Roosevelt's labyrinth enjoyed selected meals from the 5th Avenue, such as pastry from cattle cattle and Maryland celery soup.
His menu on this day, however, was more modest: eggs in the devil's way in a paradise sauce, potato pears and as a dessert of sweaty pudding.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with people who were suffering," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: "It was also a message for Americans to eat."
A couple who live in Brooklyn Heights are devoted to gastronomic history.
The last book of Andrew Coea "Chop Suey" was about a Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book "97 Orchard" tells the life story of the home on the Lower East Side through the food.
Their new joint work "A Square Meal", which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of the American cuisine during the great economic crisis.
They themselves showed the chef's solidarity and met with the reporter at dinner in Eisenberg's store with sandwiches, a small tight buffet in the quarter of Flatiron, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and sandwich with dried olives, Andrew (57) gave a crocan, potato cheese and vegetable mixture.
The reporter ordered a mass carbanate, which, according to a couple, was very good at talking about food during the crisis.
"The carbs were very popular," said Ms. Ziegelman.
He was selling buraca, liver and pheasal carbanettes.
They were made from the mixture and other cheap foods that the ingredients set up.
Stop the amount of bugs you should have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe's getting sick.
"They would lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, an American kitchen, especially in rural areas, was given as a buffet of what you dream of.
The women were cooking for farm workers and for breakfast, lunch, and dinner were served a freshly baked cake.
They were the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "And Square Meal" follows how the nation was balanced by the fact that it was not a land of perpetuity.
"It was the time when food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe explained in an explanation why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was equally worried: mystery food, such as carbanats and casserole food, casserole as "a wonderful way to use the remains," Ziegelman noted, as the chefs could hide non-esthetic dishes under the layer of cream sauce.
The fresh fruit was replaced by the cheapest dried fruit.
Mass - after a long year the central point of American food - became a slowly allocated luxury.
Strange mixtures, which were to serve as caloric and nutritional fillings, had a preference before taste or even a healthy sense of cooking.
During the research for a book containing recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a daily meal from a cooked onion filled with butter.
"It wasn't a favorite dinner table increase," said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman stressed: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter with cooked onion does not come together.
It was typical for a lot of home recipes.
As never before and ever thereafter, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the sixth federal household economy agency in 1923 to 1943 - led the country’s eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they called on women to take over the budget burden, and they turned cream spaghetti, like creamy spaghetti, into delicious food.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical insights.
In particular, in response to the government's hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "I'm going to have a cup of tea".
While publicly praising the simple Iow Farmer's kitchen of his childhood, he was standing as a chosen millionaire who became.
"He liked to eat continental cuisine, such as fish with currant sauce," said Andrew Coe.
He ate in an almost evicted room, he had a tux on himself.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistakes if his wife, Eleanor, did not accept him as an example of his own stomach.
According to the book, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housewife who was not interested in the taste at all. This led to the White House being “not given the most expensive food in the whole of Washington, but also in the most uncomfortable way prepared.”
A number of eating habits from the time of the crisis have decomposed immediately as the earth was restored to its feet.
The link remained in our constant examination of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science applies to cooking.
Some say that during the writing of the book, they better understood the eating habits of Miss Ziegelman's mother - perhaps why she couldn't throw out the food.
"She was really afraid of food spilling," said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman recalled: "It was bad people."
There's been an accident with the vegetables.
When there were clean tables at Eisenberg, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert that they prepared at home: a Swedish dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called sweat cream," said Ziegelman and added that the usual trick was to give modest recipes an elegant name.
There was no cream there, just sweats, a little milk, sugar, water, and butter.
Everyone reluctantly threw a spoon into a dense humid mass.
Surprisedly, it was wrong.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as the right host said to his wife, "It would be a bit of a bit of dried hair."
Europeans: Migrants are coming for doses.
Most refugees who flock to Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians are making fun of themselves.
That's how the show would look if we were to touch them.

Gilead has a claim for compensation for legal representation in the case of a patent against yellowish type C against Merck Group
The judge of the periodic court decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has a claim to pay fees to lawyers who created it in the course of a patent against type C yellow on Merck & Co Inc.
In June, the judgment was annulled, according to which Gilead was supposed to pay 200 million for the damage caused by the breach of the two Merck patents in connection with the very successful medicines of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the federal judge found repeated unlawful proceedings on the part of Merck, besides lying under oath and other non-ethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman stated on Thursday that Gilead is entitled to a decrease in fees incurred in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market in medicines of a new generation against type C yellow, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates from 2013, when Gilead and Merck complained to each other and claimed to be the owner of the basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, an active component of the medicines from Gilead.
US-supported military units claim to have gained full control of the city of Manbij
The U.S.-supported military units gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic state fighters fled the city, he told the speaker group on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now investigating the remains of a group of radicals who were hiding in the city.
The units released over 2,000 civilians who were radically detained, said Reuters Sharfan Darwish of the SDF Alliance and the Manbídje Military Council.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching for it," said the agency Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate 34.2 per cent
Hillary Clinton published his 2015 tax award on Friday, stating that the presidential candidate for Democrats and her husband had incomes of $10.75 million in the year and made a real tax of 34.2 per cent.
Clinton spent $1 million on charity in 2015, mostly on Clinton Foundation. President Bill Clinton contributed to the common cash amount of almost $5.3 million for lectures, and the former foreign minister granted $3 million from Simon & Schuster for his book on his role in the foreign ministry.
Clinton's co-founder, US Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, published a tax receipt in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine are still a model of financial transparency," said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton with the campaign.
Against that, Donald Trump hides himself for false excuses and withdraws from his earlier promises that his tax admission will be public.
It is common for candidates to make their tax admissions to the President of the United States, even if they are not governed by the law.
Trump, a businessman from New York, and his lawyers quoted the audit of the U.S. Department of Finance's Tax Board as the reason for his refusal to publish his tax admission.
"Your move," said Hillary Clinton's campaign on Twitter and linked to the tax recognition of democratic candidates.
Michael Cohen, Special Counsellor Trump, said on Thursday CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish tax admissions until the audits are completed.
According to Trump’s criticisms, among which the Republican candidate for the president of 2012 Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, agrees that his refusal raises questions about his net profit, his contributions to the charter, trade and other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton is making a strong statement on the issue and published a video on Friday, reminding him of how highly the Republic of Trump demands that he publish his tax admission.
On Thursday, the issue is mentioned in its statement on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other candidates have done to the presidential office after decades - to publish his tax admission," he said in front of the people.
Politico said that Trump paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times publisher quoted a number of tax advisors and accountants who claim it can be the same today.
Federal tax rates have become the subject of the presidential election.
Clinton advocates a rule named after the billionaire Warren Bufet, which would ensure that all who make more than $1 million a year will pay tax at least 30%.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet at Clinton's meeting in Omaz, Nebraska, where Buffet's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, called on Trump to meet and exchange tax receipts.
Buffett said he also went through the IRS audit and that Trump was "not afraid" of the financial office, but of the volunteers.
Clinton's campaign published tax returns until 2007.
Clinton, who now lives in Chappaqua in New York, paid a federal tax of 32 per cent on average in 2007 to 2014 and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 per cent on average.
From Clinton's tax admission in 2015, it follows that, unlike most Americans, they earn only $100 in wages.
Their main investment was the low-cost mutual index fund, from which Clinton received dividends and interest of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chili or elephant fire extinguishers in Tanzania
Nature protectors in Tanzania use a non-orthodox way to prevent elephants from walking into human settlements - throwing condoms filled with chilli powder.
This process has been certified and the Honeyguide award, which came with the idea several years ago, along with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes this process and schools volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, as using this inviolable process in four steps to protect their homes and crops, without harming animals.
Many of them used copper to defend themselves.
Friday is a world day of elephants dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since the time they have developed this ... file of tools, we have recorded a change of behavior in these communities. People believe much more that elephants can keep out of their fields without harming them,” said the Executive Director of the Honeyguide Damian Bell Foundation in a statement.
The first and the second step is to light the battery on the passing elephant and launch the kleakson.
If it doesn't, the so-called "chillie" will be thrown out.
Chilli the powder mixed with salt with the petardo is wrapped in the condom, and its end is absorbed so that he can only watch his nails.
After the fire, the condom will explode and the fine chicken powder will spread into the air.
Most of the time, there's only one curtain, and the elephant looks in a different direction.
The last option is to turn off the fire extinguisher that triggers a loud, clear explosion.
Jewish director turned to a Berlin hotel for removing the code for calling to Israel for "a request" of the Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin caused a riot in the media after finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calling to Israel, according to the employee's words on the basis of the "demand" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the documentary about the Holocaust “Shoah”, ventilated his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel call list.
However, the State was not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and destroyed?
He wrote Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers the possibility of calling to Israel through its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation and the problem was to go to the hotel reception.
The answer he received, Lanzmann says he was "shocking".
The hotel employee replied that the measure was "decided after considering the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason for the director's move was even more inflamed.
"Most of our guests are Arab and they asked for Israel's code to be deleted," Lanzmann quoted the employee in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman referred to the case as "a lot of shame".
We were terrified and shocked by the events.
It's a huge shame to be alone.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and, in addition, in such a hotel chain is even more embarrassing.
There's no need for another explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event triggered a strong online response, people labeled it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski hotel simply "lost" in the demands of Arab customers.
"Hanba to you," another contribution indicates that the hotel, which is located in Kurfurstendamm's noble street, stands near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel's journal, the hotel itself quickly dropped any charges by marking the event as a "survey" and Lanzman as an "accused".
"Never a direct order was issued" does not include Israel in the list of call codes, quoted Suddeutsche Zeitung as the representative of the Kempinski hotel.
He adds that the call code was added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber missiles against Protestant Brazilian students
The students and the police met in Brazil on Thursday when the students met for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police against the protestant used tear gas and rubber missiles.
The problem was solved when the government's order services tried to divide the students, which ended by the police using rubber projectiles and tear gas.
A number of hundreds of students took part in the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of the Governor of San Paulo Gerald Alckmin to save money is the closure of nearly a hundred public schools and the relocation of 300 000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were able to see how they were adopting written against provisional President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest is coming only a few days after the demonstrators were released to the streets to support President Dilmy Rousseff's meeting when the Senate in the country decided on her complaint.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 % - RT Business
According to the Russian embassy in Iran, Levana Dzhagaryan increased its trade turnover by 70.9 per cent after the abolition of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran in the interim comparison.
As the ambassador stated, since the abolition of international sanctions against Iran, interest on the part of Russian companies trading in the country has increased.
Russian companies renew existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Another expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagarianan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period for 2015 and reached $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran amounted to 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
The growth in trade has ensured supplies of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued approximately 35,000 visas to Iran's citizens, mostly passengers.
In addition, Iran was first reached between top 20 countries according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It can safely be said that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia will be overcome from last year," he said.
At the same time, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians.
"I can personally recommend a visit to Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the memories of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition stored," he said.
Scott Callum Skinner rushes home after the British get gold in the cyclist
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the night before dawn in a male sprint team in Rio, when the three VB team held a title from London 2012.
A 30-year-old relative from Glasgow was in the role of the brake that he took for his Scott Sir Chris Hoy, and a young legend pleased him when he reached his goal and stole the victory from the hand of a favorite New Zealand.
Britain won a surprise four years ago, and Hoy won five of his six Olympic gold medals.
And the same trick was repeated after the end of the modest sixth world championship in a dragon bike in March, even though Hoy finished his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was replaced by Jamie Staff's specialist instigator.
Hindus showed up just in time.
After leaving Hoye also set free a place that tried to fill the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and looking for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindus, who was with Hoy's champion four years ago, and Skinner reached the Olympic record in his qualification, but he took his shirt in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio got gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind his bike, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change in strategy was a major part of the transformation when Hindus went to higher shifts to slow down and enable Kenny and partly Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy was watching from his BBC commentary position and when Skinner, Kenny, and Hindus went out on stage, he didn't let their eyes go.
Thirty-two-year-old Skinner, a relative from Glasgow, said, "It's a lousy comparison."
I'm here to get the best of myself and honor my name.
We created an Olympic record in the finals and we beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After the victory next to Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012 the Hindus admitted that he was on the track approved after a bad start.
The note was later withdrawn, and the British opponents had no option to withdraw.
No such problem has happened this time around this victory.
Hindus said, “With all those British flags on the courts, I felt like I was in London.”
In the last three months, we've all been together as a team.
We've lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be the indicator of progress in the past five months, then we have a successful five days on the highway.
In the form that Kenny introduced, it's not impossible to repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at the same time.
It would then be for Kenny - who is just 12 years younger than Hoy, has also been born on March 23rd (this date seems to be sacred for British sport, this day also celebrates the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - meant a total of six gold medals and one silver medals.
No matter how much Hoy got.
As another, Kenny will participate in a sprint that starts today and lasts for three more days.
An 18 - year - old relative from Bolton said: “I now enjoy this.
Team race is always the best.
You're winning with the others.
To be honest, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindus said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knight's title."
It was the only medal competition that day, but the British were waiting for another good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doul qualified as the fastest in the race for four kilometers.
Ended with 3:51,943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and finals (2:42) are taking place today's second day of the race, to which the dose manager will focus on Wiggins.
Yesterday before the qualification contest, he was discussing with the commissioner when her decision-makers called for a raise.
In a similar race of women, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavie reached the world record of 4:13,260.
The VB team relied on its strong team of career cyclists and controlled the mid-term Olympics and won a lot of medals.
After the truly exceptional performances, which showed a complete advantage in Beijing and London, the expected decrease in the preparation for Rio was observed.
In the background, dramatic events took place, in the latest series of resignations by technical director Shane Sutton in April due to charges of sexism and discrimination, and the termination of the career of the great ones, such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as the first night of the race at the Velodrum shows, the legendary reputation seems to be that the team of the Great Britain can give a peak performance with perfect timing, so it can be confirmed again.
There is no future of the camp in Portland after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland tabernacle of Cliník in Victoria - and of the jobs of hundreds of workers - is not because of electricity that the company supplies electricity and has informed one of the owners of the tabernacle of the contract on electricity supplies. It is expected that all electricity contracts will be cut short.
This step takes place after the government of Victoria decided earlier this year that it does not extend the supply of grants that the company maintains in progress.
The validity of a fixed 20-year grant will expire in November.
Alcoa Portland may be in danger of up to 2000 jobs.
In the event of closure, up to 2000 jobs - direct or indirect.
And since the tavern consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, it can have other lavine effects.
Alcoa closed Point Henry's tavern in 2014, which led to the closure of England's power plant last year.
Alcoa's camp in Portland is repulsive and threatens to close it.
This step follows several speculations about the future of the company, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and recently due to competition prices.
AGL, which supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the valley of Latrobe Valley, announced that it expects some of the other three owners to conclude the contract as well.
The majority of the competition owner is the joint venture of Alcoa and Aluminum, the small business shares hold the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"The AGL expects the Portland race to continue to function, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the tabernacle will continue," she said.
AGL stated that the contracts were referred to as ‘insurance contracts’ which were to enter into force as from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month reporting period, so their validity will actually end in 2017.
‘AGL continues to assume that the contracts will be divided into profit for the fiscal year 2017’, the power plant declared.
Any possible impact on AGL’s profits since fiscal year 2018 is further limited at present due to the strong outlook of the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL stated that it had already written the value of the contracts in its books of $187 million "in the event that it would end."
Alcoa stated that the conclusion of the contract's decision "has no effect on its ... ability to operate a tent or to secure the supply of electricity to the tabernacle."
The US company stated that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was due to start paying since November of this year, even though it still had to explain why the contract ended.
The analysts are very careful with regard to the possible closure of the portland tavern in Victoria and the Tomago race near Newcastle as a result of the poor economy in the sector.
AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts at the beginning of this week, said that Portland annually consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity and around 900 megawatts of Tomago.
If both companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the market [electric energy].
It would not be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only a star reality TV show of Kardashian - now is the cover of the shooting Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), the model and fourth daughter of the mother-managers of the Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, appeared on the title page of the September issue of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the Ambassador of the Estee Lauder brand, who held the fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on his Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry in view of this title page," Kendall wrote.
The opening of the title page was followed by a bizarre (or simply humourous continuation in Kardashian?) scened video, in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (Baroque designers Rob and Caitly and with them all the favorite comic strips, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). On the cover of their sisters, they forgot only so the scene could end with a classic tour: they prepare a secret party.
It's a protected history line for almost every "birthday" part of a children's television show (Seacrest reads: "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the honesty of the cartoon queen in the eight o'clock in the morning), but Kris needed to make sure that the other girls on this publicity could live.
Because when we look at the January issue of the Vogue magazine, we are sure to enter the new era of Kardashian.
Senior sister Kim may have put Kendall on Vogue's cover (she was on it together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the January issue of the magazine is another league.
The magic edition of the Vogue magazine is the most sold all year round.
The edition, which reminds its audience more of the book for advertising purposes than the fashion magazine, attracts a whole number of publishers (Fashionist estimated that from 832 pages in last issue there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The discovery of the star that appears on the title page is unmistakably expected, so it is not surprising that in the past two years, images of the magazine have been avoided even before its official publication.
Among the women who appeared in the past on the cover are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista or Kate Moss.
In recent years, the title page has certainly revealed more "celebrities that make models" than "models that are celebrities".
Jennifer Lawrence, the holder of Oscar and the ambassador of the Dior brand, appeared on the title in 2013, a year later she had the honor of Lagy Gaga.
But although it is highly unlikely that Kendall, whose magazine describes as her generation's "problem model", will fall into the first category, will be in a very good company.
These celebrities are not related to known people, or the stars of reality shows, or children today who know how to make well-cut videos (even though Jenner represents all this).
They are demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the title page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career due to the issue of the Lemonade album.
Of course not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the original Victoria's Secret model in June, criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called her "girls of the moment".
These feelings were once again heated by the report that Jenner was appearing on the Vogue envelope.
But this dissatisfaction isn't in place.
Kendall Jenner's on the cover of the dawn Vogue.
It's a supermodel in the right sense.
He plays for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you make-up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling pictures of themselves to their own payrolls.
She sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter who took pictures of the magazine Love.
And in free moments it works in reality show, maybe just as one way to see Courtney and her kids.
Community Legal Aid Centres of 160,000 people per year
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable citizens are refused in Community legal aid centres each year, and in the sector itself they are looking for further restrictions on the financial resources for the already overcompensated services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, the threat of workers, victims of violence and people without financial means - are already refusing to seek free legal aid and representation.
Community law services, which are already so keen to break up, are going to be more difficult.
As of June next year, these legal aid centres will attract 30 per cent of the federal funding.
The Head of the Community Legal Aid Centre in Queensland, James Farrell, said that according to the latest summary report, the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centres was found to have been rejected annually by five thousand people.
Mr. Farrell said that without canceling the federal government's decision, the situation would worsen.
"The Community legal centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who have avoided relations with a rapist, people with excessive and protective debts, families undergoing separation, workers who are unjustly released - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not have the opportunity to get the help they need.
Since June 2017, the federal government has reduced funding by 30 per cent, leading to the fact that thousands of other vulnerable people from Queensland will have to focus on complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the State Representative and Senator George Brandise to prevent this short-term funding immediately from getting the help they need when they get into legal problems.
Last year, the government has been committed to ensuring the financing of legal aid to the extent of the international average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the community's legal aid centres and the community of their clients and the Palestinian government must invest in this important work.
Complaint against the Donald Trump campaign after a board member allegedly targeted the weapon
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was filed for alleged inaction after they were told that the director of operations in North Carolina in February directed a gun to a staff member during the trip to the jeep.
The incident was described in the court register that sent Vincent Bordini, a former software teacher in the state on Wednesday at the Court of Justice in Charlotte.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before he concluded that "it will not happen".
Director Earl Phillip "set his fingers on the gun, gave the right indicator on the trigger and directed Vincent's head to the Czech," Bordini stated in the complaint.
The list states that Bordini found, following a complaint from local and regional authorities, that at least four other people had the same experience with Phillip.
"The weapons must not be fired to cause damage," Bordini stated in the complaint.
The complaint comes only two days after the Republican candidate for the president has called for a raise when he told the voters in North Carolina that they could step forward the owners and holders of arms (which is amended in the second addition of the constitution) if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and he could appoint his judge.
Trump's campaign says the media ran out of context and Trump didn't watch out for violence.
Bordini, in the appeal, seeks compensation from the campaign for neglecting supervision and from Phillip for endangering personal security, unlawful use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump's speaker, Hope Hicks, did not respond immediately to a report requesting a comment.
Trying to get a statement from Phillip was unsuccessful.
WCCB, the local intelligence branch in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had left the campaign recently.
Call his advisory company Innovative Consulting Services nobody responded during a short period of time.
The Republican candidate for President Donald Trump runs a controversial pre-election campaign.

British must expand the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of recovery and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is enormously attractive, just as it was in London in 2012, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to compete from the Olympics.
The Olympics marked huge benefits for Startford and East End.
And we'll do it again, so we'll create opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we create 10,000 new schools, 40,000 new jobs, and we end up with the unemployment of young people around the airport.
Just like before the 2012 London Olympics, there will be those who will think that the extension of Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be prepared for the Olympics and that we would laugh at the world stage.
Suspects were wrong in 2012 and even in Heathrow's case it turns out they were wrong.
Heathrow can answer every question that concerns him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is a project of infrastructure that is shared by many people and companies, not only by a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, an economic growth of 211 billion libre, to leave heritage in the form of skills and employment both in the airport and throughout Britain.
We have a great team on Heathrow, who, in time and with the budget set up an infrastructure investment programme of 11 billion libre, starts with the T5 terminal - which was chosen by the best terminal in the world five years after itself, after the T2 terminal, which was built between the two worst wounds in the world.
They are now ready to add a third wound to which is worth 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The games in London in 2012 were a huge success for the United Kingdom and I am convinced that the extension of Heathrow will also be.
It is time for us to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, secure business in the future, and leave the legacy of skills and jobs to which Britain may be proud.

Adblock Plus - Facebook in the game on the cat and mouse in blocking advertising
From the attempts to cover the blocking programs, for companies that make online marketing, it became a game for cats and mice. At least it claims one of the companies that programs such software.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus on its pages published a contribution stating that users can update filters in their program and re-block advertising on this social network.
Facebook stated on Tuesday that his desktop site will change the coding around advertising to make it more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the site are advertising.
But now Adblock claims that the new codes have already passed.
Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote in a blog that "this kind of war between the open source blocking community and those who try to hug it lasts from the time the blocking was found," and that Facebook will probably come with another own repair.
The fact that the company owning the largest social network in the world has been involved in war only proves how major a problem has been the blocking of advertising for industry.
According to the study, last year, Pagefair and Adobe have been using advertising filters around 200 million people worldwide - almost four times as much as it was in 2013.
Mobile advertising now reaches 84 per cent of the Facebook advertising profits, every day Facebook from mobile devices will visit 1.03 billion active users.
The speaker stated, however, that the company goes against advertising filters on the desktop because mobile advertising filters on the mobile application for social network and Instagram do not work.
Advertising on the desktop still represents a profit so high that Facebook decided to invest in it.
Facebook also announced on Tuesday that it will update the "ad preferences" tool to allow people to better control how ads appear.
On Thursday, Facebook announced that Adblock's new filters are concerned because they could also block content that does not relate to advertising on the site.
“It’s not a pleasant experience for people, and we want to solve this problem,” Facebook spokesperson told in an e-mail statement.
Blocking advertising is an inefficient tool, and that is why we prefer to focus on building tools such as Ad Preferences that give control to people.
A woman hit a car on the Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the street in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses of an event, where on Thursday in the early hours there were several vehicles taken by a woman who was probably trying to commit suicide.
An accident occurred on the A1 road near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
The Vaud police stated in a statement that the actor "zoofalous act" was lying in the dark on the road and passing it several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a woman at age 49, wanted to kill herself and hit several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but according to the police, not all of them have been identified yet.
A criminal investigation was opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, said legal representative Gilles Hofsetter for Le Tribune de Geneve.
It is still necessary to determine whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent an attack?
This has to be found by the plaintiff," Hoffsetter said.
Based on two similar cases over the past five years, drivers do not seem to be responsible.
In both cases - one of which was about the person going on the road - it was decided that the motorists could not expect a walk that was passing through the road in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year the police officer was acquitted of the death of the homeless after she met and killed a man lying on the A1 road near Payner in August 2014.
The court found that the victim had been drinking alcohol at the age of 22 and had gone down the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was in an appropriate manner and that the presence of a man on the road was "a very exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge stated.
Anyone with information on the quarterly incident that occurred at Morges should report to the police on the phone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Offices and Agency (AČCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague to arrive within Prague.
On Friday, it was announced by CEO AČCKA Katerín Petríčová.
The sixth anniversary of Prague Pride began on August 8, the festival is approaching the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
"Praha belongs to the most popular destination of the LGBT community, which is for a high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialised companies," Petríčová said.
According to the survey, foreign visitors to the festival lose on average 3100 crowns per person per day.
Gay tourists are available to support their travel to Prague special maps with a complete list of Prague gays and gay-friends bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile apps etc.
"For travel, it is generally paid that LGBT customers are very lucrative, interested in living in higher price relations with high standard travel services and losing more than others," Petríčová said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium will be held this year under the festival programme.
It is presented by experts from the LGBT travel sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme of this year is love, but the actions will also focus on several thematic areas, including family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
On Saturday, the festival will be the traditional route with allegorical cars that will come from Václav Square to Letno.
The reason that thousands of people attended last year is to observe a minute of the silent memory of the victims of the June attack in the Orlandan Night Club, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Matt have been celebrating for 40 years.
The unresolved cultivator Pat and Matt, whose effort usually ends with disaster, has enjoyed small and large spectators for 40 years.
The pilot part of this evening series by director Lubomír Beneše had the premiere on 12 August 1976.
Following the creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries of the world, the jokes of the artist and director Lubomír Beneš, who designed for the magazine with two boxes of Mr. Ogolíčka and Sedleč, were drawn.
Benes then called for the collaboration of the dramaturg Jiří Kubíčka and author Vladimir Jiranka and together created the film Kúcáci.
Today, with a yellow and red trick and a ball and a radio, they received the works in 1979, when he began to create a series for Slovenian TV in the short film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were then given in 1985, this time it was already directed directly for the Short Film of Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of the animated AIF Studio film in Prague and Curychu, where further works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creations, many of which were shared by Beneš ’ son Marek.
At present, there are over ninety episodes of the stories of these corners, which all sleep under their hands, but never get angry at themselves and are always full of optimism, ideas, and vengeful enthusiasm, and finally they are content with their work, which shows a known gesture "...and that's it!".
Pat and Mat even moved from television images to books, to DVDs and to theatres, or to other toys with Pat and Mata images are the target of every toys.
A story for Fiji and two years of harmony.
At the end of the week, we've chosen one sport and one of our lives for you.
They both have a good ending.
Let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved its historic success.
What is the cause of the joy of the whole earth?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and she's happy with her.
And for what things do people spend the most on airports?
It's a Friday review from the world's websites.
The first medal from the Olympics.
Historic success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
Ragby's selection of this co-sponsor won the final Olympic tournament of the seven-year-old team of the Great Britain.
It's the first medal Fiji won for herself at the Olympics.
Waiting for the profit of the first precious metal lasted sixty years since the first expedition to the Olympics.
There's a lot of credit for the success of Coach Fiji.
But it's ironic that Brit Ben Ryan is there.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the finals what the British citizen could have been satisfied with unlike his countrymen.
"Let's play free and easy and see if we can handle the biggest game in our history," the coach told the finals.
Fiji finally ruled it sovereignly, and the small state with 900 thousand inhabitants is now experiencing the Olympics.
The report was brought by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and good luck for a little girl.
Two years of Harmony-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living with her for 11 months and her leg has been getting a new friend.
A lady who looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," the two-year-old girl rejoiced as her mother made up for ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to have her hands and feet down and then sits down together without a prosthetic.
Harmony was diagnosed with meningitis type B in a few years of life, with only 10 percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny and she never gives up.
He's got surveillance.
I've seen her show up to the other kids with the words Hi, I'm Harmony and I don't have a hand, my mother added.
Look at the joy of the lady.
What do we spend the most at the airport?
CNN brings a finding that people at airports lose most of their packaging water.
The network of Hudson's travel essential stores has published data for the last year, where it includes 10 products that customers buy most frequently at their airports.
The water was a sovereign first.
The drinks were generally very popular, and in the first ten, eight were placed.
The ninth place had a large M&M candy packaging with coconut flavor.
And can you figure out who's closing the first ten?
No food can be eaten as one of the above.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Between the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The Sovereign of the Universe.
We're just gonna win, Murray and Bond laugh.
The ambassadors Eric Murray and Hamish Bond of New Zealand sovereignly rule the categories of twins without a rider for seven years and confirmed their dominance in the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
In the first place, the two did not have to go to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and since 2009 they have run the competition.
On the farm Rodriga de Freitase in the quarter final, they won 69th in a row.
What else are we in?
We're just nicer, Murray was already joking during the Olympic regatta when he was supposed to answer questions about the domination of the New Zealand twin.
Honestly, we don't do anything different to the others.
We just practice hard, hard hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their powers are also remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is a nearly two-metre and stochyllic clock, academically looking at Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
Besides, they have a different nature.
Bond is studying and committed to finance, Murray has for example a charity boxing match.
That's why she doesn't spend a lot of time together.
Eric's acting in a boat basically because we can't lose.
We're just gonna win.
I have a tendency to think about what can be shown, he admitted Bond, who, even at the press conference, made it clear that the dominant in the crew is Murray.
He was always answering as the first one, and Bond was waiting for his chance.
But on the water, the rivals are destroyed by a calm force.
They're running their pace, and although often in the middle of the track they're not in the front, at their gradual acceleration, the opponents have not found a prescription yet.
We run on a two-mile track, and we never wanted to go the first mile up.
We're just trying to run a pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said forty-four-year-old Murray.
With his four-year-old younger partner, he won seven gold medals for the world’s championship.
They also triumphed in 2007, when both were members of the gold fours without a cormorant.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to relocate to two without a belt.
At the London Olympics, the biggest defeat of their careers was apparently opened and the Dominians confirmed in Rio as well.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it would be damn hard, and we had to make sure that we were mentally well, said Murray.
We know that all of us want to get out of the throne.
We still have that target on our back.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute of Space Studies have developed a model for exploring Venus using instruments and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine if ever on Venus, the surface of which is hot, without water and propelled CO2, could be subject to conditions similar to conditions on Earth.
Scientists have already suggested that the low rate of turn of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
According to recent simulations, however, Venus may at times have been proud of a rare atmosphere similar to the Earth and then turned slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
On the planet, areas were probably dryer than on Earth, but at times there was enough water and geographical diversity to control life and provide protection against rapid decomposition.
Venus was also used by the sun, which was 30 percent darker.
“In the simulation of the GISS Venus model during slow rotation, it exhibits its daily side to the sun almost two months at a time,” explained a scientist from GISS Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This is the result of heating the surface and creating rain, which creates a dense layer of clouds that behave as a rainstorm and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than at present on Earth.
The model made up the story of Venus similar to the evolution that planetary scientists had previously hypothetically made.
Although Venus was probably inhabited in the past -- over billions of years -- it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans were cooled, and the water springs were burned with ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen escaped and remained only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of glass gas -- that's Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new climate model Venus in Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy registered for the Colorado Avalanche team coach post
Patrick Roy signed up on Thursday for his post as coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey operations, as a reason why he was unable to participate in the decision-making process on the issues of the team.
Executive Vice-President/General Manager Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed a step and stated that the club is starting to look for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have acted as chief coach and vice-president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," 40-year-old Roy stated in a statement.
For a long and intense time, I've been thinking about how I can improve the team, give him the depth he needs, and get him to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice-president of hockey operations be in accordance with the vision of the organisation.
It must also be able to participate in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his team's benefits.
"Patric informed me of his decision today," said Sakic.
We appreciate everything he's done for our organization, and we wish him a lot of happiness in the future.
Roy was nominated for Jack Adams as the best league coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to win 112 points and first place in the Central Division. Colorado, however, had met with Minnesota in the first round of play-offs and during the last two years he has not always won the season.
The Avalanche team reached score 39:39:4 in 2015/2016 and missed five points to get a second wild card at the Western Conference.
The company Roy, who enrolled in the Sino of Glory, won Stanley Cup four times -- twice with Montreal Canadiens and twice with Avalanche.
Workers on the oil surface in the North Sea renew talks and interrupt the state
The senior representatives of the working parties stated that the positions for employees of the oil area in the North Sea were interrupted, while all the parties to the dispute were in a new round of negotiations.
At meetings against the Wood Group oil field service company, sporadically took place on the North Sea area, which is operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the United Nations and RMT committee organisations can confirm that they have agreed to renew the process of resolving the current disagreements," the statement states.
It starts next week and we will have a series of meetings in the coming weeks, where we will try to look at problems from new angles.
According to the trade union organisations, their recent actions, which, according to their words, were the first in more than 25 years, to protest against wage cuts up to 30%.
Wood Group this year reduced its rates and paid its suppliers in the North Sea by about 9 percent less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the company's interest is due to a 10 % reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that other companies would provide space to cope with a market decline.
On the other hand, Shell disbursed thousands of people's payrolls and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries due to the modernisation of its processes - immediately after the mega fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from low oil prices, the economic situation associated with the June Decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, a member of the Parliament from Scotland, Dave Anderson, met with committee members to discuss one of the biggest job accidents of the entire generation leading to the North Sea situation.
The North Sea, as he said, is of vital importance to the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for all, not just for some," he stated in a statement.
For comparison, in 2016 almost $1.4 billion of investments in new projects in the North Sea are expected, while the average over the past five years was about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of turning stars in the Pleiades
The latest mission of Kepler's Space Telescope to help astronomers is to get an almost complete list of the speeds of turning stars from Pleiade's Star Cup.
New data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the constellation are at different speeds, and how the time of rotation is related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope to learn more about the relationship between the star mass, its age and even its history in its solar system," stated Luis Rebullova, a research workshop at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena in the new report.
The Pleiades Star Cup is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster now reach the state of maturity and have been created over 125 million years.
Now it's turning as fast as possible.
At the maximum speed, these adult stars release a huge amount of star wind.
Because these winds are moving along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with the age of the star, its speed of rotation slows down.
Kepler measures the speed of the rotation of each star so that it measures the time between the discovery of discernible points on the stars -- similar to the sun.
According to recent data on the speed of rotation, larger stars turn slower than less massive stars.
The revolution compares stars to dancers, making pirates slower than the smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" Pleiåd we see that the slower the moving stars are more massive, while those that are moving faster are usually very light stars," Rebullova said.
Because Pleiåd is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of the stars and the speed of rotation.
"The shields provide us with the anchor for theoretical models of the star rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars," Rebullová said.
There's still a lot we want to learn about when and why the stars slow down their turn speed and say, "He's hanging his dance boots on a doll."
Rebulblová and her colleagues have described in detail the latest analysis of the speed of turning Pleiåd in three studies that will soon be published in the journal Astronomical Journal.
Is the qualification agreement necessary?
If I didn't sign up, then wouldn't the qualifying agreement be closed and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after graduation without applying for special education?
It seems to me that in the field where I would like to work, the job is now free only in some distant hospital, but almost a year and a half it would be possible to set up a place in another place where I would like to work.
So I don't know how the situation is about half the way it's going to work out, the question goes on.

No legislation imposes no obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - hospital.
The Qualification Agreement shall be a legal institution governed by a labour law and may be concluded between an employee and an employee in order to ensure the reimbursement of the costs incurred in connection with the increase or deepening of the qualifications of an employee.
In the field of health, however, a long-term pressure on the non-conclusion of these agreements has been developed to ensure the mobility of health workers and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Law No. 95/2004 Sb., the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional qualifications and specialised qualifications for the performance of medical examinations by a doctor, a dentist and a pharmacist, are expressly applicable, whereas participation in special education is considered to be a deepening of qualifications (not to increase them).
This means that a qualification agreement may be concluded under the labour law only if the costs reach at least 75,000 CZK.
No legislation nor imposes the obligation to apply to special education.
The law only lays down the conditions for the application for inclusion in the field of specialisation education.
However, the doctor is permitted under the law to perform a doctor’s appointment by completing the required school course, even if the conditions are laid down under the law (under the supervision of a doctor with specialized qualifications in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation where professional practice in another field of specialisation may be included in specialised training if its content and scope correspond to the relevant education programme.
Theoretically, it would be possible to start a time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the hostage situation.
However, given that I do not know the circumstances of this case, it may be recommended to consult the competent Committee of the Ministry of Health (the Committee of Health and Medical Appeals) as the Ministry of Health provides advice and consultation services related to the classification and duration of special education.
The advisory service shall also be provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, to which each doctor must be a member.
Syrian Halab doctors ask for U.S. intervention.
The United States has not made any effort to end the siege (the rest of the city by government forces) and have not used its influence to protect civilians, quoted from a letter addressed to the White House of the AFP agency.
"We do not need tears, sympathy, and even prayers; however, we desperately need to create over the eastern Halab without flying zone to stop attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab will not be reoccurred," the doctors said.
Russian forces supporting the army loyal to President Bashar Asado have announced that he will stop every day for three hours in Halab area to allow safe passage to humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 till 12:00 SELČ are to be stopped all military activities, air strikes and gunfire.
The chief of humanitarian operations of the United Nations Stephen O'Brien welcomed it, but stressed the need for at least a two-day approach.
In Obama, according to the AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors who act in the eastern part of Halab are already in control of the rebels.
It says that during the five - year war, witnesses were violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world looks at and finds how complicated Syria is, but it's only doing little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation from the Syrian regime and Russia are just as easily targeted threats, brought by pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors.
The doctors indicated that 42 attacks were reported in Syria last month, of which 15 were reported in the hospital where they worked.
The saddest thing is that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
Little children come to us with such serious injuries that we have to choose between them who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the necessary material to help them, the doctors tell us.
Two weeks ago, four newborns were drowned when the explosion interrupted oxygen supplies to their incubators.
They were breathing and then their lives ended - before he could really start, they remembered.
The army entrusted to President Bashar Asad, supported by the Russian forces, surrounded the rebellion in the past weeks by a controlled eastern part of Halabu, with no food supply of more than 200,000 people inside.
The rebels who are under constant attack from Russian and Syrian air traffic managed to break up and start anti-offensive on Saturday after three weeks.
Both sides then arrived in the city and its surroundings strengthened.
