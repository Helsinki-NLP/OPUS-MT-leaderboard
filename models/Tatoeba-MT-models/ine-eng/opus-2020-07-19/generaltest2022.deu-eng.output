The product cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the product....
I'm #PRS_ORG# wholesaler and so it's not a problem for me.
You only need a number or instruction that I should attach to the package so it can be taken back by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for €249.
Today it costs 179€.
I honestly think that is very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or do I have another option of credit?
I also find, in principle, that children should not be encouraged to take a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I find that it is also good for large sisters to take care of the small ones.
Take a look at it, help it with it, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family with and are involved.
As long as they can be enough of themselves, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 is busy for the short time alone and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can do the best you can to determine whether that's appropriate for your children.
It's not like he's changing K2 and going to sleep for hours.
It's probably just legal.
Maybe that's why the psychologist's statement comes too.
Because if something really should happen, like a fire, break-in, earthquakes, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk that you want to take, of course, is your assessment;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember having read a Crimea / Thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost all the action, but I don't want to get part-out anymore maybe someone here knows how to...
The story was about fear and to treat them.
At the beginning of the story, an animal killer commits suicide by overcoming food and going to his predatory cats.
The case will be taken by a Commissioner who, after a brief investigation of his therapists, will conduct a clinic where he treats patients with fear.
The Commissioner has a small nonexistence that has a fear (before fire) and landed in this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is commissioned anonymously to go to the place of suicide and document and put the photos on the Internet.
In any event, it turns out that this therapist operates a type of underlying therapy group where patients are transplanted with a chip, which suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately puts the patients to the extreme of fear.
(a woman jumps out of the window and goes another way for death)
This fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
At the end, there's a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is so the gross act I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author/author.
If this action is known to someone or even someone can betray the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh yeah, I don't have the password for Wlan.
I need you to contact my husband first.
But it can take a while.
What steps do I have to take then?
Is it also possible to recover the price difference?
Child, 4 j., split under the thumbnail
The child, four years old, has over the entire length of wood splitter under the thumbnail (outside).
Have tried to pull him with a pint.
It's very hard to catch.
He didn't hit and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
It's going to the doctor tomorrow.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to drive resuscitation
Always new Omikron cases provide politics and science in Britain.
Thus, until New Year, all qualified adults in England are expected to receive an award.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to get ahead even faster in the Corona seizures due to rapidly increasing numbers of omikron.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose until the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson told his countrymen on Sunday in a pre-registered video message.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The British government will also provide support to speed up vaccination campaigns in the parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omikron variant, one faced an emergency, which is why vaccination protection must be urgently strengthened, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection with a third dose of vaccine can be increased again.
"Let's get out of here now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 additional Omicron cases were recorded in Britain, increasing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa

I am for everyone to come up with pronouncing
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to answer the e-mail.
But unfortunately the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I lied to him and wherever he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Can someone help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to keep an officer walking over the feet.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouncing.
It has a total of 5 books.
Four of them go.
It's just that one I bought today is not going
Apparently, the chair had no apparent defect in the sale.
How can such damage occur after 9 months ?
Just trying on the #PRS_ORG#.
But it's been working since about.
14 days no more.
That's why I always bought the last books on the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
But there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want to add 2 chairs to your order and take this into account.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content Warning: I will write something in detail here about domestic violence.
I just need to write something from the soul.
I (21) come in contact with victims (and victims) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
A topic that really bothers me at night and unfortunately is too often that many victims are not allowed to help or think we could not help them.
I'm perfectly clear that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation under four eyes, with the killer far beyond sight and hearing, I cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of cancer, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of getting the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is, in part, very close to the tears, all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it's never going to make it easier.
Please, always think that you are worth living without violence that is so incomprehensible.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What happens to the series "League of Legends"?
Many Fantasy, many complicated names, a stunning discovery: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently been launched on Netflix.
Why do we look forward to the two staffs already announced?
basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel of the MHP Giant Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Craigsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick was released.
Nothing again: For the second time in not even three months, the giants lost in Craigsheim - and how!
In front of the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with a look at the Pokal descent at Hakro Merlin's Craigsheim in early October: "We still have some anger in the belly."
But it didn't fall after the game - but it increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) - defeat in the basketball league.
With more than that naked result the way of the appearance disappointed.
The representative was called a statistics expressing the whole dilemma: The triier quota was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all the same from young John Patrick) in saying and writing 31 attempts - even questions?
John Patrick replied: "We were simply not concentrated enough after the victory at Tenerife, and did not implement what we have trained".
That's to move the ball.
On the other hand, he reacted to Sebastian Gleim: "To win a noble game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people before."
Only 750 visitors were allowed on Saturday in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came at their costs.
Not least because of BBL-Topscore T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and driven the game of his team.
"The best gamemaker I've ever trained," Gleim said.
While in Patrick's team, the performance leaders such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebough (7) were on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (2:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and reached up to eight points after they had already fallen to 39:59.
Next to John Patrick, Justin Simon came to 12 points.
Fortunately, a lot of time to hate doesn't stay.
Already on Wednesday (9 p.m.) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg maximum 750 spectators.
We used to have another email address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I already reported a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all guarantees were rejected.
We have legally informed ourselves again and therefore wrote them down again.
We were originally notified about half a year ago.
Just like the egg pecked: Max Raabe becomes 59
He has the ability to entertain his audience with new interpretations of battlers from the 20th and 30th years.
He is currently on his way with the program "Good Day, Dear Happiness" - if he may.
In fact, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it's not going to happen.
The concert planned was launched in May 2022 - "on official instructions", in order to prevent the Corona virus.
Others of his performances planned in the Advent period must only take place once, as it is called on the website of the singer, who is now 59, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists want to meet their deadlines, which have already been set in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalia Lünen, Max Raabe already sang much and gladly as a youth.
In Berlin he studied opera songs, in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with fellow musicians.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of battles and songs in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded a lot of prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For Women It's No Problem" (2013) - the second place of the charts.
He made it out of the niche in the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair coming back tight and looking at labels, Max Raabe from the current German music landscape is no longer to be remembered.
With the program "Good Day, Dear Happiness" he has been on tour. dpa since 2020
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood before?
It is complemented with existing furniture and so we could first check whether it fits colour
It still doesn't work. I can't just see the cover sheet, but I can't see leaves.
Federal Ministry of Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by eviction
The new Federal Ministry of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken against the acquisition of large housing companies, as was required in Berlin in a national decision.
"With an event, there is no new apartment, only the ownership structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sunday).
My goal is to guarantee tenants that their rental will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colourful mix of private tenants, associations or housing companies is, for example, the best protection against monopolies.
In Berlin, the SPD, Green and Left-Party coalition wants to set up an expert commission, as is the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not close talks directly with the FDP in the Ampel coalition on further abbreviations in rental law.
The Coalition Treaty provides for a rental price brake by 2029, a limitation of rental increases in stressed housing markets and the extension of the rent level.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice in order to implement this as quickly as possible.
However, if the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps", the SPD politician stressed.
Hello, I wanted to order something, and after a few days I was surprised that I forgot the last step in payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do they know when it will be ready again ?
Or will it ever come again?

At least 100 dead by Tornados in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, many tornados have been pulled by the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be reported.
The images there remind of a war zone.
During the night on Saturday, several heavy tornados in the United States have set up heavy deserts and may require up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave about 320 kilometres of snow in the desert, especially in the state of Kentucky.
His Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado was going, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that this is possible at all.
He alone counts Kentucky with up to one hundred dead in the Member State, the official figures rise hourly.
Hello, I just saw that she sold Vitrine #NAME#.
That's too bad.
Will it still be produced?
Or was she taken out of the range?
Is it possible to order this glass in another country?
How long have you been reporting?
If delivery cannot be done in my apartment, I have to cancel the order !
I understand that, but can I just order the blankets now and let them deliver to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article via the contact form or gave up a return and wanted to ask if it came or was processed, as I have not yet received confirmation.
Firms pay immunization premiums and change advertising conditions
While the Federal Government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination award, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees money prizes for vaccination.
They are thus on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans to call for vaccination - according to a German example - is also intended to increase the readiness to corona impressions.
He's changed into a company he's been harassed about.
That doesn't make his situation better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously did not settle down in his old place and sought out something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't find you well at the time: well, no matter.
He didn't find his job well, either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
This will then be legally relevant.
I'm making a screen shot.

Help on First Own Campaign
Boron to the grumpy!
I just lead for a group of 4 friends the adventure over the grab pass and I want my heroes to lead seamlessly into a campaign written for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made to write the evil weights and their motivations, the individual acts are invented, and now I am writing the entry time and clumsy already at the first encounter over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a work of wheat from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
The next step is to be taken there.
Some miles away from the village are supposed to pop up a group of Goblins and lure them into a backbone.
I want to give players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convince, act, threats, early recognition of the danger, whatever the players have to face.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 with muscles, 6 with bends and cables armed
In the absence of notice, the Goblins run up to the heroes in a highway and flange to every three left and right bends to me, arming the truck while two with muscles stop the truck.
If it comes to fighting and under the heroes, I have two solutions
1. All the heroes are found unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village school.
Of course the career is gone.
2. If a defeat is inevitable, take this half with two of his servants and come to help the heroes in the fight.
The career's still there, everything's great.
How dare you keep your God ex Machine of Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The Goblins group will later play a decisive role, so it is not just cannon feed.
EDIT: wow, I didn't count on so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my Narratives.
I built the lamp again.
And it's stuck together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send her back.
Then you can get the return note, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Here the lower part was damaged, so almost the part with the stauraum.
Will everything be picked up again, or will it be only the staurarum part?
I'm generated by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season, the quality of the German Sky has gone down more and more, so I want to make some air with this post.
For the first time today, in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was interrupted to start the F1 report on time.
Although it was due to the late beginning and the start of the schedule far behind the schedule, it would still have been possible to show the last ten minutes (planted) as well as the winning decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, F1 enjoys priority and therefore has to restrict everything else, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
However, it's stupid that Sky UK has transferred the race too much.
Nevertheless, a small praise: Commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation of the serious accident well.
Then there was rule knowledge in the F1 again with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so they didn't know that you could change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that gaps could change the tires when there were corresponding radios on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for disappearances.
I believe that such basic rules should be known simply when you comment on the F1 in a pay TV broadcast.
It is also not the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainty on the subject of rules.
Generally not like the artificial comment style of Roos, but say that the taste is.
But there I really like Heiko Water better than RTL.
To this end, constant alberheitudes that make both simply unprofessional, such as the ordering of coffee at (also unconscious) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Just the latter brings a lot of anxiety into the comment that he obviously does not take these seriously.
Not least, the advertising simply takes over with Sky, in which the only channel that goes into the advertising is Sky, as you can listen to with F1TV, only the German soundtrack must come out without comment immediately after the race.
Neither ServTV nor ORF do that.
These two broadcasts in the trainings also make less advertising than Sky, and that as free TV broadcasters.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The remaining Sky Sport F1 program is also very smart and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking transmitter that transfers the F1.
Unironically, RTL makes the advertising a better job at the four races that they can still transfer.
In any case, the grand F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
On this: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
First Lady told me that it was sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of these has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the substance has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for your support.
Air pumps are excellently suited to provide an additional aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system over air lifts.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate all the systems.
If you have a large aquarium you can use pumps with 2 or more exits so you can connect several outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model air pump, but also offers to put an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air cover (you can find in our shop) or with a decor that turns the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasured pipe, muscle or something like that.
The MK series has a special, soundproof design and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The air pump is connected by a 4/6 mm air hose to an ostomer etc....and it can be released.
The air pump should be the same, or higher than the water level and be applied outside.
If the air pump is below the water level, you should put a back valve between them.
Just cut through the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent if once the water would run backwards, which the water from the pool runs through the pump...
If the air pump is applied freely, you should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The MK series pumps are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we specify the 3 day processing time here in ebay, it will be packed daily and the packages will also be picked up daily here.
If everything goes well, it goes very fast.
We just want to avoid a little so that no one is right, just because it once lasted a little longer.
It would be that not everyone has an understanding for all the employees who also work in the shipping sector...of course, there is no keeping Corona here.
Please do not consider it bad just because the delivery is delayed, which is exclusively for the package services.
Of course you like to joke about these services, even if we say at the moment, they've got it damn hard.
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be mad at anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there are even better times.
How long does it take to order the yellows with and without arms?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to the world world
The daughter of the first American in all, a TV moderator and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday from the "New Shepard" missile system by Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the United States of Texas.
Under the glowing blue sky, Bezos took the freshly fried astronauts in high person after their return.
"Come back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue rauman suit when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and members of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed up and down and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on their way 10 minutes and 13 seconds and reached an altitude of 107 kilometres.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut, flew to all Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after which the Blue Origin missile system was named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan was the honorary guests of the company, who had paid four other passengers for their tickets: Space Engineer Dylan Taylor, Investor Evan Dick, Technology Entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not share.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He's been working hard on his work, and he's got to do everything himself.
She just got away with it, the 74-year-old said with a smile.
Michael Strahan was excited, too.
He'd love to return to everything again, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers high
The "New Shepard" missile system is largely automated.
During the flight away from the rocket, the capsule reached an altitude of about 100 kilometres above the earth, timeless before the reusable object was removed from large parachutes again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts view the earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third all-mannered trip from Blue Origin: In July the first time Amazon founder Bezos was himself on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old US pilot and an 18-year-old Netherlands.
The second in October was the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who was world-famous as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", along with the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics advocate Bezos and Blue Origin to advance the business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the well-being of mankind and regardless of the climate.

On colour change, the lamp retains a light color for about a minute before it gently passes to the next decorative color.
The solid way of constructing the Smart Stone light is proven throughout the year.
In the snowy environment, their light is even particularly good – only with shorter light time is to be calculated as soon as the days are shorter.
In winter, please note that no snow affects the solar module in its function.
“Smart Stone” uses a NiMh battery in the usual Mignon ("AA") format, which can be exchanged easily if needed.

Someone who worked in biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I am currently studying in the first semester of biochemistry and find the case quite exciting and also not bothering me in the laboratory (have already the inorganic chemistry practice behind me).
Of course, I also informed myself before the study on occupational prospects, but I thought at the time, which I would definitely like to study until promotion and will be.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, and I am particularly impressed by the prospects for employment.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you always hear great professional opportunities and the profession is completely sought, on the other hand you hear again and again from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I'd really be interested in:
1) What are you working on right now?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/content?
3) What did you study/ what training you have done?
4) Would you do all this again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really uncertain and superior to 2022, possibly interrupting the study and making a training for the computer technician.
If you have experiences there, you also like to write :)
Extra stress before holidays & holidays weekend
This topic came up to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's only now a clue.
Not only before big holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our business.
As it seems, there are also the days before holidays plus bridges.
It was like this: Last week it was Maria skylight, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week it was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So, what happened last week?
All over stress.
Louter e-mails, which had to be issued before departure, order here order there, all *unconditional* before the long weekend.
Because... I because?
Because "the next week then" sounds so much time and that can't be?
Or because people want to do as much in a short week as in a normal?
Not only was I upset on Wednesday then, but I was also very nervous.
What is this self-defense about holidays?
Then why do we still have a holiday if we cannot afford it properly?!
The stress was not well noticed from the top, the colleagues were all so self-contained.
My question is: Are we the only ones who are Swiss?
Is that our reformed evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) rejoices at Christmas in her Thuringian home - but still has no gifts.
"The beauty, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, is simply taken to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FPH.
She'll agree to the party by backing up with her son's platzchen and bastele.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
Until the appreciable days, however, they still have to do some things: "For the first time I have no gifts yet, I must finally lay down."
NECTON-BIO supports the smooth running of the mouse and the feeding process.
NECTON-bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg Biotin/kg.
NECTON-bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny fragrance.
The majority of damage caused by poultry retention is due solely to food defects.
Since the feed consists of a protein-containing substance, the formation of an undisputed poultry garment is a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses occurring during the mouse are based on poor or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NECTON-bio, the adverse ratio of amino acids in most plant feed products is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamins should be administered during the use of NECTON-bio.
NECTON-bio is cold water soluble and can be supplied simply via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you so much for finding it.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
DDR-manufacturing model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the lock was used in Schlesien and middle Germany, the very rare lok is probably from the redesign of the model treadmill ME Heft 11/1968, used with play trails and missing parts see photos, function well, The E 95 series is a heavy-duty electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn Society (DRG) designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Schlesische network, possibly also originating from the small company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Hall (Saale) and we are able to operate
In 1924, the German Railway Company commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive which should be able to transport 2,200 tonnes of coal trains and 530 tonnes of passenger trains at 45 km/h travel speed.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as 1Co+Co1' locomotive with a tank bearing drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens sugar plants with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the supply of six locomotives received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and then returned to the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946 the locomotives arrived as repair goods in the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
The design value of all six locomotives was identified in Dessau.
[4] In 1959, the three E 95 01 to E 95 03 locomotives were re-elected, with the remaining machinery being a replacement donor.
Initially, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 were preferably built up.
Only when E 94 found that the number of processing could not be increased could the E 95 be added to the point of view of processing.
[4] The locomotives were first stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren railway plant.
They arrived in 1960 at Halle P.
They were used in their own cycle plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complexity of steering in the locomotives was problematic with increasing age.
In this way, it was often the case that shields remain stuck during switching operations.
Then, on this locomotive, the constantly accompanying Beimann with Hammer and Holzkeil had to solve the shields during the journey.
Damages to the motors often occurred and led to monthly accidents at the locomotive.
[5] Since sufficient new locomotives were available at the end of the 1960s and a clear expansion of the electrical plant was not planned at the time, the railway could ignore old locomotives and most of the splits, so E 95 was excluded from service.
In addition, they found that the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electrolocomotives only one-off, which would have caused a problem in the train operation due to the said difficulties with the machines and the visual conditions of the driver.
[5] In the middle of 1969 the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were postponed, followed by the E 95 01, who left the service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was therefore never used.
Until the E 95 02 all locomotives were destroyed.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a soft heating plant on the main railway station Hall.
It took some time before the managers could be convinced at the Reichsbah that the E 95 was a museum locomotive.
In 1979 the first external development of the locomotives began with the aim of presenting them to a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] It has since belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operable museum locomotive.
In 1986 the internal completion of the locomotives was carried out.
In the DB Museum Hall (Saale) the locomotive museum is maintained.
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P traditional community have been working on the operational development of the locomotives.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time to an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior painting, with the transformers being checked and five motors operating.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Schlesische mountaineggsbahn and the drifting sideways, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance load.
In February 1945 the machines were converted to the medium German network after Leipzig.
Main use area was first in Germany

The centre bar does not fit into the intended holding.
So I get new sent.
Then when will they be sent forth?
No flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right of the form, they were only too narrow
But that doesn't matter.

Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
Household fire with two light injured and high damage
Two people were easily injured in a fire in a home in Oberbayern.
In addition, an estimated damage has occurred in the six-stage euro area, as the police reported on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residence in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were brought to the hospital on Sunday with light smoke poisoning.
The exact thing about fire was not known at first, but the police didn't go out of an intentional fire.
The Kripo Prürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But it will come much later
And I have to pay the shipping costs again.
To unlock Fake News - Bientech-CEO released Impf-Photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021
Biantech-Chief Uğur Şahin had not so far made public his vaccination status.
The company now published a photo showing its Corona impression.
A friend's illness moved him, Shahin told him.
The CEO and co-founder of the main company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, published a photo showing how he received a vaccine against the Corona virus.
In the social media, there was false information that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the biotech pfizer vaccine," Šahin wrote on Friday in an article in the network "LinkedIn".
"For a few months, friends have forced me to post a photo of me on which I will be vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
He has so far rejected this because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply disturbed when I learned that an old school friend was fighting for his life.
He has been struggling with a severe covid-19 disorder and has been hanging on a beat-up device for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not implicated, Shahin continued to write.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often cut down by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is only hard to deal with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the German Welle, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was produced in December 2020, as did the Deutsche Welle itself.
"I am currently not legally allowed to receive the vaccine itself," Shahin said at that time.
There is a priority in Germany in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the priority has been lifted for a long time - and the Bientech Chief has, according to his own data, been improvised three times.
Fire in a power plant: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in Nordrhein-Westfalen the light went out on Friday evening: no electricity left and in many cases no heating.
A fire had set up a fire-fighting station.
After a fire with severe damage at a voltage station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Siege crisis in North Rhine-Westphalia have to come out for about 24 hours without electricity.
By the fire on Friday evening, 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities went out of light.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday many emergency power units were in operation until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely resolved in the late evening.
Firefighters and assistants of THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered services in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The provider thanked the people concerned for their patience and the helpers for their use.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the municipalities concerned, the circle, the firearms and the THW for their tireless use," said the head of the area of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz monteurs were able to take some lines only temporarily back into operation, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire according to company data.
Power flows again
The fire broke out on Friday at 7.15 p.m. according to Westnetz at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid station, parts of the 10,000-volt-scaling plant have been severely damaged.
There heavy cleaning and repair work is needed.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
Since Saturday 6:00 p.m., over 21,000 people in Much and Rupichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually activated from 21.30 p.m.
Since 23.15, the last one has been affected by the failure.
Over 80 monteurs from Westnetz and partner companies were in use.
After the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday morning, the authorities also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is important now that citizens and citizens take care of older or self-employed people in their neighbourhood and communicate with local firearms if help is needed," said Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
In the construction and operation of emergency power units, mainly the residents of old homes were focused.
In addition, temporary care facilities have been established in schools according to the authorities for those persons who were unable to provide themselves or the power-dependent medical devices are referred to medical care.
Good morning!
Unfortunately, the deck is sold in Germany.
Can I buy those with you and pay in euro?
It's the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue.
I hope you also have a nice day and stay healthy.
But I can't mount this under the floor on the table.
It's custom #NAME#.
There are 3 performances.
We wanted those with table plates diameter of #NUMBER#
We got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# came in, but I can't intrude it and therefore shorten it.
Can you help me out there?
Otherwise, I had to send them back, because they're not suitable for the purpose.
I'd be happy to report back.
Yes, that's really easier!
Then we'll do it!
Can you send me the return card by mail?
the repair is now complete.
I've already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I did not restart the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Shall I do this now?
I find such a low letter almost unforgivable.
That's why we don't agree.

I have to work through it too!
In order to ensure uniformity and purity, you should clean the components with some soap water of dust, fat and fingerprints, wash and dry with clear water.
Before you bring the brush the first time with a new color on the model, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
This can be done on the later visible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first stroke on the piece
Draw the brush evenly next to the stroke.
Light coating of the paint layers later ensures an even area.
Avoid the brush quickly and with the brush.
This creates unrealisticly effective areas.
A model is not a garden boy.
Start with the bright colors.
The darkness might appear later.
Metal tones and metallic colours come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can come to unpleasant metal slicing when mixed with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you touch them.
Originally trusted appearances reach the models through the Decals or subtractors.
From high-level signs on aircraft, from names of ships to zoos and signs in car models: The Decals give the model the last slip.
Bring the Decals in the right order, as long as the components are still good to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or easier before it is installed in the rump.
Even more important than the right tool, such as shears, brushets and toothpicks, are during the sticky time, patience and a calm hand.
Cut out each required Decal individually and set it right.
Decals are also called water slide images, because you'll have their back just stuck with water until the wearer paper gets dark by the nose.
Then you scroll the picture just a small piece of paper and place the piece on the corresponding place on the model (which you have previously mentioned).
While holding the Decal on the model with a tool, you remove the carrier paper from the side.
Attention: Always check if the picture is right before you flip it completely from the paper so it doesn't stick on your finger, scratch or even scratch.
Swallow excess water with a household sink.
Not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I look for something else, then I don't read the book anymore and I have to log out and sign up and reload the book and look for the place where I have read it.
I've already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages
Thank you very much, though.
Then I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But do I get it back without any problems?
Childcare at PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together,
We had some time in childcare, now that it's about accounting with the PCV, it's all over.
Order by:
We had applied for the children's wish tour in advance at the PKV and got the commitment over 3 attempts.
The tests were limited in no way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the PCV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and we did 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but they still did not count out with the PCV.
We applied again for the cost of the PCV and received 3 further attempts.
After some further trials (we have performed more trials than promised, logically counting the most expensive with the PCV) we adjust the calculations at the PCV and get the bad surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3) the PCV only wants to replace 3 trials.
Reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment are due.
The second wish for children was a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, however, "The insurance case begins with healing, it ends if the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who has the right here to replace the PCVs (only 3 attempts are made) or we (are 5 attempts to replace them)?
* Would the PCV have to point out in the commitments that with birth the further attempts are due?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (subjected to closed ladders) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here gave your opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Please let me get the three variants by email and tell me how to get them back to the best
All right.
We won't order any more with them.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
They'd like to pass that on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the refund was made and now tell me that I only have to send the thing back.
I don't think I can do anything to make the commoda come to me completely ruined.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
There is clear and clear that the repayment has been made and I still have not received any repayment by #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that they've lost two family customers now.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not gonna do that anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
An office chair must maintain normal use.
Otherwise they may not sell it as a desk.
Regardless of this, the guarantee shall be valid for 24 months.
No, I can't get another type of packaging.
I will be able to remove the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Good afternoon, I have a question about your #PRS_ORG series#
These products will be purchased with additional hookers to be purchased, but unfortunately we can't find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The Best Low Budget Films
What a low-budget film is exactly, there is no general definition with precise budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget movie** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no found from a major film studio or private investor.
In the network you can find a lot of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know the interesting representatives of this category?
What's wrong with you?
And maybe you don't like it at all?
I'm a very good customer of you, I've already set up 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it also reliable now?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
If there's no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min, it's not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes on the waiting position...I'll start again soon, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
"Halber victory" against Belarus associated with high costs for the EU
In the conflict with the Belarusian regime, the EU can announce a "half victory", according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
However, the costs are very high and significant violations of the rights of migrants and refugees in Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainablely, the EU has not solved the confrontation, the researchers of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP) explained.
This state of sweat - Belarus does not contribute very little, but the EU feels like a winner - may continue for a while.
Dealing with people on the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Obviously, there is an increasing "normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not committed to this, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It obviously cannot be implemented when a Member State is in the head to do its thing," like current Poland, which does not even allow Frontex EU Border Protection Agency access to the border.
In addition, the EU has paid another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, as Bossong: A policy agreement on asylum policy will be difficult as the line "frontier protection, border protection and border protection" has been strengthened.
Reiterating attempt to cross-border
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have again tried to reach the Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and returned to the border, a speaker from the authorities said on Sunday.
In the case of Czeremsza, the Polish officials were accused of stone by the migrants.
According to the information, a soldier was struck in the face and had to be provided by a military doctor.
A total of 52 border crossings were registered within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU, Alexander Lukaschenko, as power-holder in Minsk, proposes to have them angelish with a view to entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania report on press reports according to border sections.
The EU punished Belarus and threatened to bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travel in the people's countries of origin to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU's response is the pressure on the refugees," Bossong said.
"There the EU has cast its market power into the scales and has demonstrated its determination to operate with hard tapes and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic costs.
The Belarusian society is not likely to insist that the security system regularly shuts down thousands of people throughout the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial formula 1 finale
Max escapes were to have two rules broken during the race, in the view of Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial formula 1 finale of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an objection.
The silver arrows assume the same two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a alleged violation of Max's departures in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he should have been overdone on a regular basis.
A second opposition was filed against the rating at the end of the race.
In the view of Mercedes, the protocol was not followed regularly.
In the last round of Lewis Hamilton in Mercedes, he was still caught up with his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety-car phase in which the Netherlands had taken over the car before it.
I'll check it out.
I'm talking to the bank and report to you again.
Thank you for the support
Free entry for members: Europe-Park organised SC-Freiburg-Fantag
The Europa-Park, the nominee for the Europa-Park Stadiums of the Freiburg Sports Club, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As announced by the park, members and card holders of the sport club from Breisgau and members of the Fan community were allowed to visit the European Park free of charge on this day.
In addition, there were also vouchers for drinks and sausages.
On that day, the rear trains lit red and white through the trikots.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-white air balloons provided the perfect bullets," said the park.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, there has been cooperation between the Federal League and the Free Time Park located in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg.
On the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the European Park again showed how well the partnership works.
Seeing radiant fans who have fun together in the rear, confirm this," says Europe-Park Owner Jürgen Mack.

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the series "LiteraTour Nord" read author Judith Hermann on Friday on the sold blue note from her current novel "Daheim" and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the night noise at her door.
I gave up the contact form yesterday to return an article, but did not receive e-mail confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request was answered.
It doesn't everyone have the time for your crowded chat and wrongly delivered cheapware from China.
Your mistake, which you fix, not all of our household.
Contact woman #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or a woman #NAME# receive an email with a 60-euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# nighttable and a return label.
This e-mail hasn't come yet.
The package wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.

Sorry, but just because he says he's not anti-Semitic, that's nothing.
It's like a rapper says he has nothing against foreigners.
Your i won't give it to both of you.
But colleagues are constantly reproducing any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just let it complete.
Yeah, well, then you're a little as serious as a colleague.
Those who seriously question Evolution in principle are simply completely resolved.
For my sake, a God has put all this into effect.
But as soon as you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is only convulsive.
And so you're a science enemy and don't take any more seriously like a colleague.
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the lupe should be approached to the eye as close as possible.
The specially aplanatic-acromatic lens system allows you to use the lupe to the edge zone in a practical way.
Lupins are often marked with enlargements.
However, these data only apply to precisely defined conditions that rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to use your lupe optimally, please note the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see package leaflet).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices - i.e. also in the case of impact valves - light flexes occur.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflex coating.
In compliance with the optimal conditions of use - Lupe close to the eye - mirrors on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
For further information, please refer to the instructions for use (available in German and English).

Dance sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz women look out the Christmas trees
Landwirt Frank Dieers has already experienced this kind of situation when selling teeth.
One time a man should even be driving home without his partner because they could not agree.
Every year he plants a good 2000 pieces for it.
The 56-year-old has already experienced such a situation.
That makes the Christmas season a little fun, he says.
What about the gift?
Or am I gone as a customer?!
However, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need discussions here about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is rubbed on a rotating spear.
So they both have their names.
In Germany, an equivalent might be as much as the "Dreher", which in far away does not sound as nice.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new glass fibre connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I have problems building a stable WiFi network now.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which has received up to a few randoms of 50 Mbit and sent out.
The new glass fibre connector sends 500 mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and to the DLan module attached to the FritzBox.
However, on the other DLan module, which sends the Wifi, no longer the full 500, but the more I remove myself in the house with the module, the less comes (so use a single dose that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new glass fibre connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently used a new technology.
Although this was slightly better than the DLan, there were also similar large losses here.
Could anyone explain to me why with glass fibers so much Internet speed over the power line is "lost"?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely difficult to lay down in the house LAN cable.
I'm really disappointed why I created an extra account here.
That's why I'd be glad to hear more about an answer.
When it's time to change the giro account
Anyone who thought now would be quiet for the first time in the giro accounts is fooled.
While many banks have taken advantage of the fall to confirm the tax increases in the past with all kinds of tricks from their customers, the free amounts for negative interest continue to decline.
For example, the Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of EUR 100,000.
Now she has just half the amount of free money and even surrounded for day money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group-Part Postbank - to EUR 50,000 in giro and investment accounts and to EUR 25,000 in day-to-day cash accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower amounts are applicable to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a speaker on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The commercial bank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still applicable, as was the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, who was just popular with the most expensive customers, has reduced the free amounts to two levels, first at 50,000 euros, and now at 25,000 euros.
At the same time, more than 100 banks currently have a free amount of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the Verivox Internet Portal.
The Sparda Bank Berlin has also arrived at EUR 25,000: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres that have been given a right to the Berlin Land Court in the first instance against this regulation.
Now, the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly be repossessions - in the case that the higher institutions also have to explain the negative interest rates in principle and repay many millions to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She's now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But your life is like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was selected by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For those who made the 2021 with the "friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers is taking care of their appearance.
Anyway, so Aniston, she likes a chip on the day (yes, read correctly: an EINZIGEN chip from the Tute).
The fact that you're still following the hearts of the female and male fans is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just got Pech with the luck - and she's still looking for the great love.
And the wish for the baby has been removed from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would be a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that, they have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurting.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame will also make you happy.
Invalid end of career: queens must give up
Kimi queen's separation from Formula 1 was even quieter than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finne pulled out the gloves and took off the sweat from the stars.
That's it.
After an error of driving and a slight banding, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the great price of Abu Dhabi after not even half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the royal class of motor sports.
His wife, Minttu, and the two children, were also traveling to the United Arab Emirates.
The biggest success of the Räikkönen was the win of the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from the pole and arrived 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in Zweijerbob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian Biathlet Ole Einar Björdalen with 94 success is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I have calculated this once, I had to win nine and a half wins per season, then I could create it until Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic winner from BSC Oberbärenburg, who booked two successes in the Winterberg race in two days.
He first refused to attack Johannes Lochner on Saturday by five hundredths, in which he drove from Rank three to one.
Then he changed something at the material setting and went out on Sunday with a greater advantage of 0,30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Hall), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Hall) he went through the British Brad Hall.
The third became the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We have gone to greater risk today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also introduced his 22nd victory in the series.
The Berchtsgaden Johannes Lochner, who is driving for Stuttgart, came to the square two times this time to rank five.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Fänderbach landed in the first four races after Rank.
"If I knew what he was doing, then I would do it," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte won the third season victory in the twins on her path.
After it ran only for the fourth place on Sunday in Monobob, it broke into World Cup World Cup with Deborah Levi on Sunday.
Double-bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia came to the rank of the fastest Sprinterin in Germany, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympia qualification, she booked the first podest place in this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig on site three.
For me, it was supercool, first floor in the World Cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama takes me.
I'm super pleased with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the beginning, but today's starting times were okay," Burghardt said, and stressed: "It's not just a rush, but there's a lot to do through it too."
Jamanka was a little upset about the not completely wrong rides, but thought, "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the cover in the shopping cart and could now buy it!!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I have not received it and therefore I cannot redeem it, so I have finally asked for it.
Because of Corona last year, I had a lot of other problems and never time for it.
And now he's been calling it off that's what's really bothering me.
Look at the chat it went around the Asare Sitzbank.
I want to give it back and then order again, as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment only started on 16.3.
There was nothing from such a long delivery time on your website
No, just when I'm typing, there's an extra field with the message
I was taken off yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you images of the wrong being delivered.
But we want the regal module, however, to be a new one.
And don't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello, lovely girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write, and maybe the one or the other goes like this...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dogmama - once apart from my dog not screaming or going to the kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) has been ill, a 2nd degree burn took place on Monday and has been depressed for years (but now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see him and feel, we had a lot of cake and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because hand is in relation to wg combustion).
He is cooled down and we now see less (1-2x week) what makes me very sensitive to my needs and love.
My dog suit has just got a bowel, I've cooked for him, and now he's in his cupboard, and he's just relaxing after I've been there with the heat lamp and fighting for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and that's just for a month.
Now there is still house work on us, which we of course share.
But cooking yourself is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just fine-tuned, I'm half-treated and I'm right.
Not good, but I'm coming right and I'm almost unsymptomatic.
My uni just requires a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3 p.m. I have made a written test for which I have not done anything and overtime anatomy hours for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have a oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no room.
So my week goes like this: until tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But then everything goes on?
Only until the day of birth.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Just until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these mental points because otherwise I'm packing it down.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't...
Is that how you're doing?
Honestly, I'm incredibly grateful that I don't have to work.
I can't really say that. I can't say that.
I don't know if I'd survived my kptbs.
I believe that this also has some to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought I'd find a secure relationship here...
I wish you at least one more relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I've got my order today. Unfortunately, the whole other color plus surface is scratched and tablebone has a print.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Two more times.
But she wasn't confirmed.
I found in school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and that it is just another matter for them like math or earth science.
For me, this was always a bit strange, perhaps because I was raised Christian, and I always believed something like that.
How are you doing?
You may also be able to talk about work or study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is sensible to separate.
Also give the curriculum, etc.
But it was also strange to have a physical teacher who did not believe in the theory of relativity.
What, then, does one want to teach religion if one does not believe it?
Is culture real or something?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can't be changed or not?Write it in English I also understand well
It's been a long time, then I'd look away from it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a feedback by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please help:
Hello, dear people.
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (by 24).
I think it's been a movie for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
To one the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Because I can't describe it any more in the real world, there's a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (Uniform like those soldiers from the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths are crossed and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm to live himself I mean.
The transition is also I think the soldier's graveyard.
In the end, both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If that's what I'm saying, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little girl slept from week 1 only on the belly.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child is much more dependent than you think.
Make sure everything's right around here, not pets, often go round and watch, but not minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good Matratze.
No pillows.
Axso and we didn't have a sleeping bag, but we've always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he's asleep.
Does it turn your head to the side?
Can it get out of the belly?
Or is it in front of the face directly in the mattress?
You can make sure everything's all right.
We've all grown up, and when my husband came to the world, it was for a walk and it seemed that you put the kids on the couch to sleep.
Also we are already "stamp" with you and have already bought a lot of articles
But why are you offering me only EUR 20?
Hello, I already wrote with a colleague from you yesterday and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived earlier (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC ID#).
The right shoulder doesn't fit in the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not to be used at the moment.
To make it quite clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this transmitter is now under all the sauces.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a large bed tour at the same time.
It was said to be an "independent" Internet transmitter.
Quotat Arno: You want to be "no running foot column".
What are you doing now?
A 0815 advertiser who is trying to bring his BilloMerch to the Elitefan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course they apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to harm people.
A krogman who is totally lacking in empathy and at the cost of the action with the exploded rooms tries to make ash.
How can you find all this good?
Great if you like it, I think it's scary.
I'm asking for a backrub, as my delivered wooden table has been made defective.

Whether as a comforter at Buchweh or just for cooking – My little warm friend is multi-useable.
Kirschkern cushions are a traditional home for well-being heat applications, as Kirschkerne heat can be very well absorbed and dosed again.
The removable inner cushion can be warmed easily in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft reference makes the application particularly pleasant to make the little ones feel protected, even if they are not doing so well.
For the following application areas only, the cross-sectional cage with reference is suitable as a heat coating:
Before heating the pillow on unusual smell, check the floor or fire spot and immediately dispose of it in the presence.
Please remove the inside cushion to warm up before the connection!
Warm up in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (note the microwave manufacturer's information!)
Just after the heat warms, distribute the heat through the shells evenly in the pillow!
Then put the inside cushion back in the case.
In the first heatings, a mild moisture formation can occur on the surface, but disappears in repeated applications.
Keep in mind the heating instructions given, as longer times or higher energy performance can cause damage (inflammation and combustion risk!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that a heat of cereal products in the manufacturer's instructions is allowed.
After the heated inside cushions have been put back into contact, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitable for babies (max 43 °C) on your wrist!
Do not use the pillow in acute, chronic, inflammatory or febrile conditions, circular complaints, fresh haematomas, blood clots and open wounds as well as in people with reduced pain.
For existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumours, and pregnancy, please contact a doctor before using it.
If no kernels have been opened and free cores have emerged, dispose of the product and the free kernels immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be regularly controlled during the application to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents involving the product are to be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country where the user is placed.
The connection is removable and washable in the machine at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!

Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening my laptop (thinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my network part.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the net part alone was enough for the operation.
The battery is empty and the laptop does not start any more despite the embedded network part.
After that, I've grown the battery, but there's nothing going on here.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network operation?
Was there something else that was broken?
Thank you so much for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But you don't know how high the seat is....
Often on a tour and yet a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design no problem!
20 litres of capacitors also swallow larger photo equipment without problems that can be safely crushed using the polished FlexFold parts.
And what you still need in everyday life remains well organized and separate from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line on version 2 (V2), the series is still presented in a new look.
The cool, minimalist design has it literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that are reliable to protect the interior of the backpack and yet provide quick access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: Once conventionally via the lid that can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proved itself at the Messenger Bags.
There is a metal cap with suitable anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered various "fills": there are 4 anchor bars, which are permanently destroyed in which the lock hooks can be attached.
If the backpack is full, if you just take the top bar, it's rather empty, a deeper one.
The hooks and hooks are also magnetic.
The backpack can also be closed reliably without the hooks being fixed.
The second option also distinguishes the everyday backpack fundamentally from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the greatest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to feel through the contents anymore!
At the same time, this smarter detail increases the everyday life of the backpack: if you include not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In every day's Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more below) and, without any problems, steal from each other - and access it independently through the two side openings.
In addition, you can pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main, while the everyday things remain safe in the left half of the backpack and do not come between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable wear belts help.
And since the outer box of the backpack is also made entirely of 100 % recycled, weatherproof nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I look forward to the email of her support.
#NAME# has me an e-mail to confirm the appointment of the

Is it to be seen when the cabinet could be delivered again?

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment were made on 12.1.2.1.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I had ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher to me, I will immediately give up a larger order, but I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And that last year was different from the idea I couldn't admit and I just couldn't figure it out in time and clarify it.
But I don't accept the damage as a customer.
Rotating brake discs are designed to assess the dynamic driver’s requirements, reliability and safety when brakes are also under difficult conditions.
Rotating brake discs are manufactured from Guss and then mechanically processed (dried and cut).
All printed discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are peculiar to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which is directed to the development of the disc according to the characteristics of the original mounting.
The hard drives made in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additional openings increase the efficiency of the cooling of the disc, with the cuts improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake locks.
The aesthetic properties of our dedicated disks underline the character of each car by its attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event marked the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered lightning cracks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and dissolved the so-called "California Gold Rush" of ‘49.
Thousands came from Nah and far and made Coloma one of the fast-growing and flourishing cities of the country.
Areas were hidden, tents were erected, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country.
For many it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankrott)!
In this game you are a pioneer who is looking for in the West wealth and wants to make a name.
You'll be looking for gold, recruiting workers, riding horses and building companies.
You will also be given the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to overcome your pioneer colleagues, so you don't have to go with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
At the same time, you choose your actions, you need to keep your resources at home and create a table that "works more and more for you" (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tablet allow you to become more efficient, to receive additional actions or to apply rules to your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual game style with fine adaptations.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year when the gold was discovered in Coloma), the year 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California reached official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will choose a location on the game plan in secret and at the same time where they can perform actions.
Then their selection is discovered and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a place has most pioneers, it'll get a hold of it!
This disables one half of the location - thus reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players perform different actions, such as the acquisition of resources, the movement of cars, the construction of tents, the search of rivers, the construction of bridges, the opening of shops and the positioning of revolvers.
If all the actions are completed, the pioneers will return.
At the beginning of each round, the contractor turns to a new location and thus changes the available actions.
This goes on for as long as the pressurer has moved five times, so every place has been hidden once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which the Coloma players have to defend against an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have committed enough revolts and the bandits are numerously superior, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive less rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final evaluation takes place.
The player wins with most winning points!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation has been published today in my Twitter-Timeline, and I have just looked at it.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a pleasant guest in Talkshows and is giving talks across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrians" (2008), he triggered a strong educational debate.
Former patients: interns and educators are now raising serious prejudices against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other managers must never, never, never! go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child a room for his development and to make the child's frame as large as it is reasonable and possible in the situation.
Brr, I'm still undercover.
Holettschek: Countries advise on failure of the test obligation for three-fold vaccinated
At its next meeting, the Ministers of Health would like to decide on a three-fold test case.
"We countries need rapid clarity, whether and from when the test obligation can occur for three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Minister's Conference, the "Image on Sunday".
The drop of 2G plus for three-fold vaccines is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional imponfance," said Holetschek.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) said that "he will be making a proposal to the Health Conference on Tuesday". - afp

I updated account data.
What can this be?
What you describe is described as *awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under full-narcoses.
These occur at a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
The most common is hearing noises/voices, the rarest to see pictures and the rarest to experience pain.
For this issue: Emperor cuts are operations that deal with an increased rate of Awareness, as a very deep drug is avoided to protect the child until it is absorbed.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned in the Narcotics Discussion.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment from me describes although Awareness correctly, however, had** u/Nitemarex **by definition none.
I've read her comment wrong.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, we do not have 20€.
These are legal guarantees.
The absolute minimum would be that they would withdraw the defective chair.
This is also the standard in the area of eCommerce in addition to the legal obligation.
Please check again if they are at least withdrawing the defective chair.
We sell the second chair in private.
We also lose some money there.
I already sent you an e-mail that you haven't answered.
Again, the question.
The order and the invoice says that the goods are delivered to a room of my choice.
The sender is a company #NAME#.
I'm just calling there.
I was told that they only delivered in front of the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that right?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I do not know the person who can carry the heavy furniture in the first floor.
I'm not gonna call you, am I?
I had formulated a question
Theatrical historian Günther Rühle died 97 years old
He has been profiled as a theatre critic and as an intender.
Later he wrote a monumental drama.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, pressurised: "An old man is getting older."
The spooky diary of a slow separation from the world, led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading, the message comes that the author is dead.
The last sentence in the book is, "I am witnessing here my life's dream."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are European lettuces, named wooden pallets, which are used primarily in the European space as cargo carriers.
They are certified by the European Palette Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria in Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced.
The value of production was well worth EUR 79 million.
How many pallets are imported annually to Austria, will not be raised
New York won the MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After the 1:1 in the regular playing time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the East Conference decided the final in the 11th meter shooting with 4:2.
In the final part of the East Conference, New York had fought against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I had received a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect gulag.
It was Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for this :)
Now I've come to taste and I want to cook the first rouladen to Silverster.
I'll set up a cattle fund for this tomorrow.
Do you have any other tips for me anyway?
Note: I don't have a oven, but just a big pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't so good anymore, but I get it
IT's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed on 18.01 by mail that the refund was made.
But to this day, the money hasn't gone in with me.
Please check there.
Where there's still Christmas Brats in the room Lübeck
For many people, Gans or Ente belong to the Christmas days such as the dance tree and gifts.
You haven't taken care of a bird yet?
Now it's about time.
We'll betray you where you get another Christmas friar in the Lübeck room.
The "drive" of a pipe level contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor switch.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can set the desired level on the one hand and the level of your sound on the other.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique power level regulation that can reduce the signal level without changing anything at the "Gain" and the distortion.
Furthermore, it was already mentioned above that with the POWER LEVEL ruler, you can even fly a performance reserve if it goes smoothly.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL rules, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is being edited with a box simulation so that you get an outstanding "acoustic" sound impression yourself when using a headphone or direct recording.
The AUX book can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so you can join your favorite songs.
A Tuner function is also on board - so you do not need a separate voice device.
If you spend an additional VFS5 foot key, it can also call the sounds comfortably by foot, turn the effect blocks on/off and the tempo of the corresponding effects "stop".
This is actually unacceptable for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX will take another step into the future!
But he had seen it with others like that.
Then is it possible for you to send the lamp back?
Because it's too low for a table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
What about the comet?
Do we get an update in the next few weeks for the exact delivery deadline?
Hello, they've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it wasn't for me, I'd be happy with a legacy or a gift.
Under circumstances, I find a receiver for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need then a little bit.
I just received my delivery and I would have liked to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hooks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been rewarded

Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
In the negotiations on the resumption of the International Atomic Convention, progress has been made, according to Iranian data.
"Both sides are about to agree on the issues that should be on the agenda," said Iran's Chief Dealer Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the Irina News Agency.
This was a "positive and important development", because at first it did not even agree on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, Vienna's talks on the revitalization of the agreement were continued after almost a week's interruption.
Dealers from Iran, Germany, the UK, China, France and Russia participate in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on-site in Vienna, but only directly involved in the negotiations.
Thüringen overholt Sachsen - Fre state now Germany with highest Corona incidence
Thüringen has dissolved Saxony and currently shows the highest incidence in the Federal Republic of Germany.
As the only federal country, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thüringen, the only federal state, was at the Corona incident on Sunday over the 1000 brand.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has always been the highest in the Federal Republic of Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incident in Thuringia fell slightly, but it also had a value of 1000.
Within a day, 2242 new outbreaks of Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths were reported in Thuringia in connection with an infection.
200 severe to Covid-19 patients were treated intensively on Sunday in hospitals.
At weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and have come up with new cases hardly yet.
I understand.
As delivery takes place at the beginning of March, it may be possible to do so.
I have to print it and stick it to the package and put it at the post office, was it?
I don't have to click/add/fill anything here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I'm writing to you.
I would like to accept the return on my own costs.
8 euro Return fee is a frequency in my eyes.
It's time for changes
##MBundeday greets me, I am u/stratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
# Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundaday, you can find one thing: it is not existential.
We arrived in a winter star and extended the summer hole for a few months.
#What's the problem?
Yeah, where was it?
For the most part this should simply relate to the dissatisfaction, how some things have gone down here and how we are generally present.
In the last days, there has been a growing impression that many people here have still bock on the MBundesday.
#What we need to change
At this place the community is asked around the MBundesday which wants to keep them alive.
The attack came from u/edizvevo, who has become aware of this project in the last days and has found one, simply said, turtleheads.
After some writing and writing, several people from the community have found themselves wishing to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to call on everyone to participate, only if this project can exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a record server on which we can exchange each other, as well as develop concrete things.
You can access the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the MBundeday work in the future?
* What existing arrangements need to be changed / adjusted / removed?
* How are we going to go abroad in the future?
* How should new members be called?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a few things, but that's not bad, we've finally got the difference.
If you have a desire and time, come to the dispute, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I've ordered a lamp screen with you that it will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/big for it and not suitable for my taste.
I've already ordered another suspension for this.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also rather sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day deck #PRS_ORG#, is there also in excess, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# needs to be able to guarantee that the wrong cabinet is picked up in time.
And I'm asking you to start now.
I don't have a suitable package, but will unmount the cabinet as much as possible for the collection - they need to clear with #PRS_ORG# how it can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by telephone at any time to agree a withdrawal period.
Is there any instructions for the installation?
How long would I have time to take care of it or decide to return it?
How do you answer the question, why are you vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She has lived a while of vegetarian life herself, today she probably eats very rarely meat.
I was a vegetarian myself a few years ago.
On the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and Vegetarianism has been a planned step-by-step, I have answered honestly without much thought.
And although I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian, I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I would ultimately also support animal quellery.
That's why my decision is to be vegan.
At the moment I had the impression that it was a missmut on her side, she then defended Vegetarianism and thought she knew where her flesh came from and reduced as Vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to "pump" was?
How do you answer the question?
If you have the feeling that you are quickly stuck as a Veganer and conflicts arise, without which you would have to put it on.
It welcomes a harmonious Veganer (;
This is clearly not an exception to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# do not disconnect from the legal requirements for remote access.
I'm at the assigned date on which #PRS_ORG# doesn't pick up my return on site.
As I cannot be on the spot because of an apology, this cannot be changed either.
May I be given an alternative pick-up period?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I am constantly meeting again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr for Water Rescue Equipment: 45,000 Euros Country Grant
In recent years, the Rhineland-Pfälze Interior Minister Roger Leventz handed over to the Lahnsteiner Rathhaus an allocation certificate of EUR 45,000 for the new device car Water rescue of the Voluntary Firefight Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle used since November 2020 amounted to EUR 135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country of Rheinland-Pfalz supports us here," said Lahnsteins Mayor Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is used by the diving staff Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rheinland-Pfalz.
Over and under water they perform tasks in water and ice management and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein it is estimated that the boom of hotel shipping on Rhein and Mosel and the continued increasing use of the lain as a leisure flow contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, following their recommendations, it has synchronized, removed and the newly loaded app NECHTS has worked.
I'm a little frustrated because the whole action has cost me a lot of time and I hope to help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection to June.
Can I enter a date in the order procedure?

For the first time, thanks to the fact that you're standing here, I've spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, we've also been gun holders in the executive, I don't want to go on!
The question of the right and the left is always very simple.
In principle, however, it should be said that, of course, the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, which should actually be clear to everyone.
That, of course, also in the particular uniform and weaponized human right of conservative magic should also be clear to everyone that these people can then naturally deal with the living reality is of course also clear, because you have of course in addition to the average white, now many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and so I do not now mean the exaggerated female clichés, because these are in the execution rather less than just normal men and women whom it is not noticed if they can't tell them) and also to these people, and I have to leave myself, because they are no doubt saving your life or putting it in front of you.
But also these border groups represent even if it sounds funny for the first time, according to a conservative attitude, they are proud of Germany and feel that they are less involved in overriding left politics, even if this policy is probably used for them or if it is supposed to make them right, they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the rights, since of course police and combat forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they can openly say their opinion there or even openly corrupt any state-threatening plans are completely exaggerated and upset me too.
Of course, even policemen and soldiers who were often in foreign service often started to pause because of negative experiences and also sometimes things say that the controversy is politically incorrect.
It is also true that even right-wing relatives will be able to exchange their thoughts.
However, what I think is well-versed and is also opposed to political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally restricted, and that is also good in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I don't understand, the other basket I also ordered on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it, it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've been chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in Black to Germany or this basket in Germany is available somewhere as well.
I always find you a partner company.
But on the top of the wood, there were two deep beryls, which were filled with yellow,

Ordinarily through a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (by myself, very little leisure time), but for the rest of my life I find it worse than right to lead my household permanently clean and orderly.
There are always stages in which everything stays, and then and when it packs me and I sleep up and drink.
But it is never so "that one could come to visit spontaneously."
My husband is also not better, although I am upset somewhere, but most of the time, the household just loses work and unemployment.
The kitchen is even the most regularly clean since we like to cook.
Now on my question, did you make it more orderly with the child?
We still have nothing to do with it, and I have been busy with this question for a long time.
Because for me I don't have any tension, it just doesn't bother me so much until a visit comes and, for example, always fresh clothes is there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger urge with the child or do you keep your mouth shut?
I'm happy to hear your answers.
Exclusive, new, and qualitatively high-quality and anatomically pre-formed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows an almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preforming with special, further tightening on the links for improved freedom of movement (on arms and knees)
For Focea Comfort 4 in Flex System 2, the area covered by the Flex System was more than doubled to further increase the comfort.
Bendless stretch panels on the joints reduce friction (axles, arm and knee joints)
High-quality formations in the lower back area and step by step provide an attractive, perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch panel in the waistbel area increases flexibility around the backrest locking and thus improves comfort, especially when building and mounting and installing the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, located around the shoulders and back, guarantees increased flexibility in the movements of the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warm, waterproof material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings heat into a sensitive area of the body.
Nailless, thin (-2 mm) Curtain on the face of the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate head lining)
Soft, power-driven zone improves the sealing with a fine-tuning wide area by a flexible, narrow-knee lock, which is not attached to the cassation or to the nails
Double sleeves with zipper closure on arm and foot joints combine a flip-in inner sleeve with a soft, caschied neoprene outer sleeve
45° insertion at the end of the inner sleeve for increased elasticity and load when pulling.

Border of outer sleeves stretched for greater load
Border of inner sleeves secured for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in its place, especially in deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common bracelet computers)
Career in social work - than someone with a more self-insecure personality disorder?
I've been training in software development and I've been trained for about a year now.
Unfortunately, however, I increasingly notice that this profession is not the right thing for me, because I have been overriding, starting again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or horrified) personality disorder (AVPS).
That means that I don't have a feeling of self-esteem, and that's why I'm afraid.
I don't have a problem with talking to people at a reasonable level, but I find it very difficult to have a casual conversation and I have been told more often that I have acted inconveniently (by which I think I have already become better).
Can I become a social worker like that?
I do not want to work as a streetworker or in the open youth meeting, but rather in the search for advice or family assistance.
But I don't know if the actual working day really is the way I imagine it, and it's hard to find something on the Internet.
The EVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there's something to do with my code ("the simplest things") and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues to help ("I should now really know how to do it"/"I keep him with my stupid questions from working"/"who really has to keep me for the least part" etc.).
I will probably have the problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it in the place.
But have you got the sofa back yet?
Because there was no confirmation for that.
I'm waiting for a pick-up date.
What do you mean, give them back?
If I have downloaded a book on #PRS_ORG#, your #PRS_ORG# report does not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG# who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) taken with the feed, the bird in its stomach-damm tract dissolves into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and builds from these its own body protein, which it also needs to be fed.
Fertiliser training in nestling and breeding in mice are extremely complex procedures and are associated with a particularly high demand for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NECTON bio may not be given during breeding, as it may otherwise occur during pregnancy.
Following this short supply of NECTON-bio, vitamins should be returned to the daily supply of NECTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NECTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

Statement by a Community member in opposition to the Statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
Our property is intended to include a walnut tree.
So a case application is sent to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the cases of fruit trees and thus the Walnuss are not part of the constitution.
In the constitution, however, the walnut is explicitly described as a protective tree.
Can I give up on the employee's statement now or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the constitution is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I didn't get a message.
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a legacy or a gift?
What were they more expensive then?
Yes, I think the only question is whether I can pay in euro and let me deliver the blanket to Germany
Can you check that out?
E-mail: Serious traffic accident at Selfb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred at St 2179 between the connection station Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police press alarm reports today (14:03) a pkw has come to the counter traffic.
There are injured.
I get it.
Well, then thank you so much again, that it was so simple!
Council and ideas for further professional life
Happy Christmas to you for the first time!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head just covers everything you can remember.
Before I leave here now .. in short: I need advice and the best of people who know my situation - that is from you.
I'm just making the reef as a queer.
Originally, I studied something else and worked there also in an area (in order to remain at least a little anonymous, I call here nothing more precisely).
The whole thing was too boring and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
Sometimes I landed at the teaching center and was sure that it was - even though the framework conditions were significantly more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I did not care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job offers".
And it's only half a year around.
At times I have always decided to continue and at least to end the reef, after which I can still move on.
But I'm absolutely finished.
I've had so little time in the last month that I've been completely out.
Now they're holidays, but there's still a bunch of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref I always thought I would be stress-resistant, but there my weekend was also my weekend and my holiday night my holiday night.
I was free.
And the stress at work was at the same time equal.
Now I'm having a family party too much stress myself.
And then there's these tough structures that make me extra nervous.
Basically, it makes fun and looks from the outside, the Ref is also doing good with regard to feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and ask myself how much stress my body can take before it completely closes - if he doesn't do it right now.
I wonder if I would like to have the rest of my life in this way - just when I read some contributions from you here - or whether I should not go back to the old area, because I was valued, could take free time when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but for this it was properly paid and worked together in a team and not as a single fighter, as is now the most time in the case.
But then I wonder if in one year, I have not come back to the same place as I am now and unsatisfied.
You see, it's all wrong, but maybe you have as an external council or ideas, like I'm out of this situation, which I'm completely finished and almost started to cry at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But perhaps your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologizing to the wine cellar of me.
I hope my situation has become at least a bit clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has continued to develop, among other things, to combine the advanced modelling technology with the Valve Reactor switch, which perfectly imitates the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely at the latest state of the art in matters Sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp switches, the VTX amplifiers are waiting for an absolutely impressive authenticity.
These amps also, of course, contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube amplifier.
This is partly based on real analogue switches, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a pipe amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated switch, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed case and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only spread.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and link historical facts on the virtual level until the Amp and effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of pipe sound with modelling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since now to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 has again led to a VOX Valvetronix series of performances - with more dynamics as well as more and more significantly improved amplifier models.
From handy VT20+ to VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed to find all guitarists looking for a maximum sound diversity here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a pipe amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced play of play dynamics and string stroke as well as a quick speech.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers have discovered that the end-stages determine the pipe character of an amplifier and developed VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor switching of each VT+ amplifier with a 12AX7 tube is the behavior, subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier perfectly.
NBA: Despite 20 points of Wagner: Magic loses at Clippers
The Orlando Magic series is held in the NBA.
The Wagner brothers can shine - however, it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven figures of his older brother Moritz lost magic on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The main feature is also adaptable: with three individual plazier and foldable shutter components, it is directed exactly as you need your photo equipment and is thus suitable for any type of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras.
What finally fits in the backpack, of course depends on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible position would be a DSLR camera with a set target, two to three variables and a flashlight.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for other targets.
You can also steal any amount of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for his equipment and for photo-stretching things.
Drone pilots also meet with the Everyday Backpack 20L an optimal choice, because the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably the longest of history
In the almost three months since the outbreak, the lava flows on the Canary Islands have caused great damage.
Is there an end to sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest known history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was 84 days long on the Atlantic Peninsula in front of West African coast.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Kumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in the past days, but Vulcanologists have no longer waited for a forecast when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, state TV channel RTVE.
Damages in millions
In the almost three months since the outbreak, the more than 1000 degrees of hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 houses and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a meridian lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 people had to be evacuated, the damage was estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new landings with a total size of about 50 hectares were created in front of the coast by the cold lava.
It was mainly concerned with the very important banana cultivation for the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 people live directly or indirectly and which was already in the midst of the volcanic eruption in the crisis.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas were severely damaged, the newspaper El País wrote.
Christmas and Gifts
Christmas stands in front of the door and especially the children will be unable to expect the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have been associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the scenic excitement of being a bit deceptive.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly fragmented society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of the gift, so that the gesture of the gift, which, according to French sociologists and ethnologists, Marcel Mauss, was a peace-sponsored "community treaty of natural peoples", can be refilled with life in the context of this tradition.
How the Christ Child Was Made of Nikolaus
It was strictly taken by the Protestants, by whom the Christmas days were closely associated with the gift.
In the past, gifts were handed over to some kind on the Nikolausday.
The background of this popular seat today is that the Holy Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, has secretly thrown gold into her window in one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional type of gift, the custom of the popular in Germany was to fill the boots with gifts, especially the children.
Protestants resorted to this use because they denied mediators between God and people as "holy worship".
For these reasons, they defend themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christ Child out of the Nikolaus and thus founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift thus moved to the Holy Night.
Since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, it only upsets the least that the use of Saint Nicholas is still a firm part of the Christmas season, like Martinsingen and Martinsumzug.
Today, you can find in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree of socks up to the desired luxury watches all that the heart desires.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources have been a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the reform, the day of the gift moved to the Holy Night.
In all Christian countries, however, a happy cuddel model raises the question of who now brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the respective region whether the Christmas child appears on the Holy Night or the Christmas man, who is basically a kind of Nikolaus, who was assigned some peculiarities over time.
This includes, for example, his white noise bar, which only has little to do with the rather strict asynchronous bar of the historical figure, his cut, which is drawn from renting and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy there is the Hexe Befana, who should have shown them the way to Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fable beings sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Fathers Frost to some glory.
Here are not retineries, but three horses that pull as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the reform in the course of the Hussiten Wars, the Christ child is responsible for the delivery of gifts.

Police shoots verbal bank robbers near the Royal Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police informed the callers that a man should have gone to a bank with a gun and a bookkeeper's business.
The man fled for information from the authorities in a vehicle which could not be stopped by officials a little later.
It was shot and the man was hit.
He was still declared dead at the tavern.
The police didn't come out of a terrorist background.
Several messages are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
What then?

Pills problem
Hello, dear Weibswolk,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year is actually delivered my first post.
My problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during the period and had a dirty PMS before the period.
Now I'd like to let it go again, because I have to take enough drugs that I can't pick.
My main problem, of course not the pain, but my skin.
At my last about two years, I had received a break from 0 to 100 explosive pickles and these everywhere.
That's so superficial, but I've had a pretty hard time and I don't feel like it.
In the two-year break, the whole has never really been normalized.
Maybe he has some tips to avoid this time.
Without perfume and without mercy my cosmetics is already, but there may be something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the doctor did not take me so seriously, and the deadline is still coming.
Thank you very much for everyone who has read through the novel!
Yes, the love skin is such a new thing.
Had prebuperts had bad neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale bone marrow and the acne theme.
Food I have also tried everything possible in the course of chr. disease and I have been hanging on low sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed food because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It may also be good that hormonal is just the worm inside, but if you like me everywhere you want to keep you from going out looking for what else is going wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague's seminar.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my concerns.
I have to work through it all the time and on the phone and all of a sudden everything was gone...
What is there to test if the money were there, I'd have seen it.
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong
But it's generally large

110-kV cable is new built in 2022
The approval for the release of the new high voltage ship at Tann is valid.
The plan-making decision of the Government of Lower Bavaria opens the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
This was now shared by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometres long cable will connect the Tann circuit in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of release near the village of Edermanning at Reut.
Good morning,
my order of 03.01.21 with order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts with us.
The blue cell number:#PRS_ORG# with the transmission number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the next procedure is now?
A nice start in the week!
You can forget, I explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a glass comedy and all the pages are covered, so the glass is everywhere and the carton is broken
The comet is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# provisions
This means that the code can't be picked up, because no one in my apartment can clean up.
Thanks for the message
But why only EUR 20?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's all books, so the question at #PRS_ORG# is probably a general problem
Ref: Plan training (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in the rec since summer, teaching makes me fun, but I still have great problems planning my teaching in the field of Earth science in time.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the table, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school I can also copy only s/w for free (which nerves for earth science).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making the theme geofactors and I actually have every hour to do.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple teaching hours (that I need for UBs, etc.).
I go from learning to planning (what I want to achieve) and think about how I can build it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that do not have my school).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather unhappy.
That's why the worksheets too.
Maybe I can work with the book on time-efficiency.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the #NUMBER# order.
I have already decided for a new at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to deal with the returns for the first time as quickly as possible.
Trade is afraid because of the 2G regulation about Christmas business.
In most businesses, only those who are vaccinated or healed may be allowed to do so.
Trade holds this for unnecessary and accused revenue cuts.
He's got a possible solution, too.
The 2G regulations destroy the important Christmas business from the perspective of the German Trade Association (HDE) to retail.
In dealing with non-daily-needed business, it was to complain about revenue cuts, criticised HDE chief business leader Stefan Genth.
According to a current survey of the HDE under 1100 traders, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negative on the rest of the year.
Many would have written off the Christmas business.
"What should be the positive height of the year is now often a hole without soil," Genth said.
Traders with 2G access restrictions thus lost almost one third of their pre-crisis rates over the past week.
Good goes only in food retail and online.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept was a safe matter, said the chief businessman.
"2G does not bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic" he stressed.
The current regulations frightened customers and required high staff deployment.
The banning system had to be approved throughout the country, he requested.
After that, each customer had to be checked only once at 2G (vomited or healed) and had access to all the shops with the tapes received on this day.
In addition, sampling checks should be sufficient in retail trade, as already in public transport under the 3G rule (impeded, healed or tested).
The Deutsche Euroshop's real estate group specialized in shopping centres also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last reported without 2G at 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the sales at approximately 90 percent.
These figures will now certainly fall in the middle of such important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Employment Week".
Due to the high personal and administrative burden, it will be tried for the Centre to find and obtain solutions.
This includes the so-called band solution, where "the visitors can, for example, at a central place in the centre once deliver their 2G ID and then - equipped with an armband similar to in a club hotel - can enter all shops uninterruptedly". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that has been tried with a yellow filler.
That looks bad.
I'd like to give the mirror back and I already packed it back into the package and glued it.
How do I have to move on to the return?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour rendering.
For setting the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor has exceptional possibilities.
In addition to the adjustment of the brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitively manageable.
The light produces a very light stream with soft light of high quality, completely flammable.
The 120 degree radiation angle with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distances is excellent.
Other than in reporting situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or on the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the lights in television studios or when the lights are installed in difficult accessible locations.
On the back of the lights is the control panel, it consists of keys and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also the slot for the NP-F battery (not included in the delivery range)
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, it is easy to set up and complete one of the memory keys by pressing longer.
The storage controller saves the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that in new switches, the familiar situation is restored - very practical when the camera is set to certain colour temperatures.
Working with battery one of the largest strengths of DL3120 functionality comes from the possibility of the company with cheap NP-F battery.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera men (and women) - so you can go back to existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the battery has sufficient power - it's a battery counter installed at the same time - for each of the two battery arrays a value in both displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
Furthermore, of course, it is possible to provide the light bulbs over the supplied network part continuously with electricity.
The construction of the lighthouse is very simple.
You have a 16mm hole to fasten, so you can directly access your photostatic.
The inclination is to be adjusted reliably by fixing on both sides.
It was considered that the mechanical components are also extremely high and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a loop link is included in the range of delivery.
Great is that also contains a bag in the delivery range.
So you can buy the lights with all the accessories you might still want to buy, without safe transporting or storing problems.
The damage I have received and it is too small :(
"Party that we wanted to make fun of": Frankfurt celebrates after a dry comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Entracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in the series of seglosen Hessen were probably on the way to the next Bundesliga Square.
But then the SGE turned up, and within a good hour, the hunger broke out over a grown season start from the soul and beat Furios with 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys have done today," said Coach Oliver Glassner at DAZN and said a "Pauschal Lob, to every one who was with it".
At first, it looked after a renewed damper for the Frankfurters now standing behind their expectations in rank nine.
Patrick Schick had led the Leverkusner with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players have then returned and shown a fantastic performance," Glassner continued.
I am insanely happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
The morale of his team colleagues was also stressed by dissident Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand back on the scene for the first time since the fourth game day and his surpassing muscle injury.
"I believe that our mentality is incredibly large," said the 27-year-old and looked forward to the outcome, especially for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to fuck today.
For the next tasks, however, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but also looks well on the staff situation.
It is exceptional that we have all the players fit in December that all the players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now you want to "go step by step and stay modest" and to "go through the tasks at this level" until the year-to-year change.
As the next thing you know, on Wednesday, the English week will be playing an outdoor game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18:30, Sky) on the program.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to an error.
I've been trying to call #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent back to me, or do I have to wait until the money has been returned and the order is returned?
If it were for me, then I would say that I will not order again because it has already lasted very long.
Have they ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dumps for handball women in front of quarter finals against Spain
Germany's handball women seem to be depressing against Denmark with hanging heads and empty views of the park.
At the end of the World Cup, the DHB election at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 viewers in Granollers was a bitter defeat and must now run against the Spanish host in the quarter final.
"We were too scared and had too much respect in front of the opponent," said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We have to act against Spain.
After the first descent in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points as the second behind the Danishs (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the river.
That was a bad game for all of us to erase," said Captain Emily Blok.
In the fight to enter the semi-finals against the WM-second of 2019, a significant increase is needed on the coming Tuesday to keep the delicate dream from the first medal since 2007.
The best German broadcaster in duel with the three-time Olympic Denmark was the rear-view player Alina Grijseels with six towers.
"We were simply not there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," said Xenia Smits, Space Player, asking: "We need to look ahead quickly now."
From front to back not above
Unlike in the previous five tournaments, the German team with the anpfiff was not on high.
Errors and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a rapid 0:4 back position after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented with some parades worse.
The first gate reached the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick opposite.
However, this was not the expected initial ignition.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, German women could hardly stand in the scene - and if so, they usually failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of Scandinavia.
So the party ran early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially the space player Mia Zschokke saw red too soon because of a hard fool at her opponent.
At the quarter end, however, it may be re-acted.
Only in the final phase of the first half time did the DHB selection get a little better into the game and until the break to at least five doors.
The only hope for a resurrection after the change was after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Greeners sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-established opponent, who was among the medal candidates at the end of the day.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to reach an increase in performance and went out of the parking lot as a clear loser.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions in Christmastime
As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we have celebrated the Nikolaus day and take this as a occasion to dedicate ourselves to family traditions in the Christmas season, the Advent, Nikolaus, the Christmas evening and the Christmas holidays.
How was your home at that time?

The chicken puppie?
Platzchenbaken?
Wooden jewelry?
Will it be mussed?
Is the Christmas man, the Christ child, or is the gift from Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone takes on and around Christmas effort to have it as beautiful as possible as family.
Whether these are solid traditions now, or even every year something else: tell us how it went into your family or how it went!
Please send me any transaction number. or anything else that could help.
Confirmation of transfer... etc
I'd like to give you a code of goodwill.
as in #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Is that with them?
The title indicates that I am active as an important in mobile implants in which (until now only) the BioNTech/Pfizer implant is immunized in nursing homes.
As soon as these are finished to a large part, it will then continue to part in vaccination centres for me.
I would like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, if they are not related to a personal (e.g. "I take medicine X, it involves vaccination.").
In my task area, the explanation for the vaccination, the indication position (person has a claim for an vaccination based on coronary disease and no reason to speak against it), the medical documentation and, in other words, emergency care in allergic reactions (I have never happened).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical professionals.
In impfeams, however, we often don't have "only" (for God they don't want a lack of value!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, but they can't carry out vaccines (can they?), so I carry out most of the vaccines myself.
Serious "slippers" question: Amberger knows the solution
What's a "Huidler"?
With this dialectic word, sent by an Amberger, the BR TV "We in Bayern" has been provided for intense thought.
But unlike in many days ahead, the term remained in the series "Host me?" this time unraveled by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one else, "everything needs to go fast."
That, when people heard from the TV moderator, was totally wrong.
On what did the man from Amberg announce the solution and thus probably also provide for surprises in many upper floors.
"The skinlers," the audience experienced, "it's a pencil that someone picks the oven with."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been questioned by Bavarian TV for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical top-upfalsic term, it somehow derives from the more well-known word "hounds".
Why was a education gap closed - perhaps also in some who have lived in the room of Amberg for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
There is always the following error message after confirmation: oops - something is wrong - try again later.
I re-started the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, synchronized and repaired with the PC.
It didn't help.
Selection of tires in the running-cycle really is so safe?
Today I am fully awake because I wanted at least a little training to prepare for my bicycle tour in the coming week.
I said, I did, and I ran with my bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what is going on in every town (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass splitter on the track.
Zack, loud pockets and my underpants didn't want to take the rest of the track in any case.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and replacement hose due to the weekend, I had to turn around with half a bad lounge and take the first train home.
It was then also not so bad at work, perhaps it is even better if I practice it with the tire change before the bike tour.
But now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long route over several days before me, I would get extremely close to this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, since even the old tires of the predecessor (very nice old man, the day I came to pick up the bike up to 14 o'clock 120km!) and who had already described it as suboptimal because he had been on the role with them for several years.
But if I think I have to take another tire change when driving 80-90km, then I really think I'm badly rewarded :D
Now I came to the conversation with an older man on the train, who asked me a surprise why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; they should be unplatible.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very attractive.
But are these really so incapacitating?
I don't like spending 40€/reefs now, just to be disappointed.
I'm also asking myself: I'm on the racing wheel at the moment I think 25x622.
There are also (apparently?) at the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me on other tires at a racetrack?
The Schwalbe-page seems to be absolute to me! Laiewisen prefer to recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you already in advance for the help and love greetings!
Car sled against tree: driver injured fatally
The 53-year-old was attacked on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an inexplicable cause against a Mediterranean island and then hit the cross-roads, as the police reported.
There it came to a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old car was then pushed against a tree and the man stuck in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old companion were severely injured in the accident and brought to surrounding hospitals.
yes we have removed all books authorized all bneu and loaded new books

After the release of our new High End broadband B 100-6 OHM it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would be returned to adulthood.
SOLO 15 is called the new Sprøssling and visually recalls the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitable design foot is included directly in order to raise the speaker to the correct voice position.
This has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted at length according to the circumstances at home.
The principle is that SOLO 15 is very well suited for people with a more subordinate role in the maximum volume, but a very high level is expected to be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to produce almost unfiltered large signal pressure level.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it grows considerably and is very impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal was adapted to SOLO 15 with a slight height rise.
This is generally used for broadband to optimize the high frequencies of highly increasing bonding.
The SOLO 15 with a very clear and fine sound is located precisely on the hearing area.
Lightly tilted outwards can reduce the height range and thus make the sound image warmer.
Thanks to the puncture source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle meter sharp and stunningly precise.
The reference suspect extremely low mechanical losses of B 100 - 6 OHM ensures an enemy dynamic that is looking for the same.
The SOLO 15 complements not only our SOLO series, but expands it in matters of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our buildings, it is recommended to start thinking about the final vision of the speaker to plan appropriate changes in the construction.
For example, if the case is to be handled, the reduction of the speaker needs to be adjusted accordingly, as the feeder again supplies material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the floor plate at the appropriate place to be able to run the cable without any problems later.
With the help of an upper-phrase, the opening of the speaker in the front follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used together later.
On the other hand, this opening should be provided with a 45° phase in order to make the opening area of the speaker's chair as large as possible inside.
The four screwpoints of B 100 - 6 OHM get a break in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail phase".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two sides on a level surface.
On these, the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now lined up.
The three anchorages should also be used and glued.
The adhesives themselves can vary in material strength if they are required, for example, if they want to return to finished performance from the construction market instead of producing them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page will be added.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, that is, the both sides, and the front.
By means of a suitable hole hole or a drill drill, the opening of the bass reflector tube and the connection clamp on the back wall shall be facilitated.
Then you use a round hair to wrap all the edges of the actual box.
This can also be rounded up on the surface of the floor.
After that, the footplate is firmly glued with the foot of the house and also scratched with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and drilling (2.5 mm drills) of the screwing points of the speaker box and the coupling clamp.
After the housing of wood dust has been cleaned (swallowing/swallowing), you begin to lay down the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The whole and short cable is moved for pieces through the 8 mm drilling in the foot until the terminal opening and allows it to appear there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the house, the cable leads to the opening of the speaker and also allows it to hang loose.
The frequency deviation is then prepared and used.
The design plan of the frequency deviations, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: Installation instructions Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequency deviation is installed and the connection terminal is scratched, the closing of the 8 mm cable opening in the box, which is not fully closed, follows.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, heat glues can be dropped onto the opening and so close.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, you can check the closure accordingly.
Now the evaporation follows according to description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and screwed with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be killed at the pluspol of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
For evaporation, a matt of the evaporative material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed into the case.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I give up an order now and let the beginning of June be delivered?
> Hello all,
> Finally, we can announce that we are also holding the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people per switch so that we will chase the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid Delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still before the pandemic – yet we'll give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will be released at about 0:30.
Have a cold drink, plan good food and prepare for a long, but very interesting night.
