According to Tatoeby's guidelines, members are recommended to add only sentences in their native language or translate them from a language they understand into their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to make sentences in their native language in a natural way. When we write in a language other than their native language, it is very easy to create sentences that make them strange. We ask you to translate the phrase, only if you know what it means with certainty.

Put it under the corner.
She fell in love with a Russian immigrant.
Did you fall in love with her for the first time?
It's one thing to love, it's another thing to marry.
I've targeted the gun on the counter.
She locked herself in his bedroom.
Did I lock the main entrance?
I was thinking about having this role this time ready.
Don't lie to me.
I don't blame you for anything.
You paid more than you did.
You paid more than you had.
I paid the payment card.
You paid more than you had.
I'll pay for Tom's ticket.
Is Tom gonna pay for it?
Please turn on the radio.
Please turn on the radio.
Please turn on the TV.
Getting Tom into this would be dangerous.
I forgot to tell you about Tom.
Did you forget everything we did for you?
Forget it, it's not worth it.
Forget about this sad event.
Forget I said that.
You forgot to invite Tom, didn't you?
He forgot her name.
I forgot to stick a mark on the cover.
I forgot all about it.
I forgot to ask for an account.
I forgot my pen at home.
I forgot my wallet on the night table.
I forgot my password.
I forgot to pick Tom up from the airport.
I forgot Tom could read French.
I forgot to disappear.
He forgot his wallet at home.
He forgot to return those keys.
He would sell his soul to the devil.
For the first time I'm without crowns, for the second time I don't have time.
Did I write everything down correctly?
The principles neutralise the acids.
I'm the last person to know the truth again.
I've lost my mind again.
You're lying again.
You're back in your old ways, Tom.
We'll see Tom again.
I heard someone talking.
I deserve good things.
I deserve to know the truth.
They deserve what they get.
You deserve good things.
We're asleep.
My heart's stopped.
Will anyone stop dealing with people?
He shot himself for unfortunate love.
I'll shoot him.
I'll shoot him.
I'll shoot both of you.
They dragged her to the store and raped her.
While I was reading, I called the phone.
While Tom was still asleep, Mary was already up.
You can still be with me.
You're not interrupting anything yet.
The police arrested him?
Did you arrest Tom?
Shut the fuck up.
That's not what I'm paid for.
I'm not paying for this.
This is what Tom will punish you for.
I can't remember Tom's conversation.
You're not responsible for Tom's death.
The whole group was punished for Tom's mistakes.
I love you for that.
I'm not paid for this.
In three months, Tom was dead.
They paid me five bucks for that bag.
She attacked him.
I'll call you back when I get to the bus stop.
I'll call you later.
I'll call you back later.
I'll call you back later.
He'll call back.
Call me when you're ready to go.
Call me when you're ready to go.
Call her tomorrow.
Call me, okay?
Call me tomorrow.
Call your father and ask him.
Call him, please.
Call the rescue!
They locked Tom in the store so he couldn't escape.
I locked the door so they wouldn't hear us.
I've closed all six windows.
Close your book.
Please close the door when you leave.
Shut the fucking door!
You have to pay me for all my translations.
We sing another song.
I called the bell and I waited.
We got rid of some old stuff.
Get rid of the evidence.
She loved him.
I love the ocean.
I love you.
The arms industry brings profits, but also suffering.
We have the rest of the day for ourselves.
There's only one day left.
What does butter come from?
I don't totally agree that this is how it works with me.
With all my heart, I hope he's happy.
She seemed to be silent.
It seemed like I was fighting in the war.
I felt like I was in love with a beautiful girl.
It seemed like I changed my job.
I thought it was a brick.
I thought I was a friend of my workmate's.
I thought it was Tatoeb.
I thought it was this day.
I thought about Tom when he got up from the dead.
The officer seemed to be afraid of their revenge.
It seemed to me that Tom didn't notice that Mary was there.
It seemed Tom has everything he needs.
It seemed Tom doesn't get anything from what you told him.
It seemed to me that Tom wasn't alone.
He seems to be very sleepy.
I think Tom is responsible for Mary's nervous breakdown.
It seems to be too dangerous.
Looks like I'm gonna be up all night tonight.
Looks like the spring's coming too soon.
It seems like I'm still asleep during the day, but it seems like I can't sleep at all at night.
Looks like I did all this for free.
You seem satisfied with yourself.
You seem to have the same problem as me.
I don't think anyone understands.
I don't think anyone understands.
You don't seem to take me seriously.
Looks like he's spent a lot of money.
Looks like no one's noticed anything.
Looks like the war hasn't ended yet.
Looks like we're gonna have to do it.
Looks like Tom's cute.
Looks like Tom trusts as much as the rest of the people.
Looks like Tom's got no idea if it's gonna happen or not.
Looks like Tom's telling the truth.
Looks like Tom doesn't remember any of us.
Looks like Tom's been asleep.
Looks like Tom's lost the meaning of life.
He seems to know everything.
He seems to be neglecting his duties.
Looks like he's losing his motivation.
Here's a picture of my school.
We need to use the connector here.
We left home early this morning.
I'm looking forward to having a good time with her on this topic.
I'm asking Tom for help.
A healthy relationship develops freely.
Health is more important than wealth.
Health is the best gift.
It keeps her from work.
Of the twenty students, only one read the book.
Which airport am I leaving?
Which glass did you drink from?
The green will cut you.

She died at 54 years of age.
He's dead.
They died in battle.
He died ten years ago.
The woman you took is very beautiful.
My wife left me in October.
The woman rejected everything.
Women must feel that they have the opportunity to do whatever work they want.
Women don't care about him.
Women like tea.
Women don't care about him.
I asked him if he would hold my back.
She asked me if everything was okay with me.
She asked me if I knew this woman personally.
They asked if they were going to write a new word.
They asked Tom if he felt safe with them.
I asked them where the train station is.
I asked Tom where he went.
I asked Tom where to plant him.
He asked if he was coming.
He asked if he was coming.
Let's ask Tom.
Ask Tom.
Ask your mother.
He made the sound, so everyone heard it.
He hit a little radio.
He grew old and divorced, but he also grew rich and became famous.
Of all the strength he tried not to think of her anymore.
I didn't like him at first.
Get out of here, please.
Get the fuck out of here!
Zhubla.
We live alone.
We've been living in this city since 1960.
Do you like living here?

Tom's coming to our school tomorrow.
The life of a banker is hard.
Life is a quarrel, and love is the answer.

Life is hard and difficult.
Life is amazing.
Life is a great suffering.
Life is not easy.

We found out where he lives.
Did we find out who the woman was?
Did you find out where Tom was going?
I found out the food's a little sharp.
I found out my bike was gone.
Did you find out what Tom's up to?
The bus made her so bad that she started throwing away.
You failed me.
You failed Tom.
Who are you afraid of?
Check if you haven't forgotten anything.
Check it out, please.
I tried everything.
I tried everything.
Son of a bitch!
Experience brings wisdom.
She tried it on her own.
I tried everything.
He tried to draw her attention.
I'll try to do something about it.
Try to have a little compassion.
Try not to be stupid.
Try and talk to the police.
Try it yourself.
Try not to take that much.
Try to control yourself.
Try this!
Try and explain it to Tom.
Try it again.

She made him angry.
I'm mad at Tom.
The criminals managed to escape.
Criminal Tom walked out and killed.
You broke your leg.
He changed the address.
Did I miss something?
It's not overrated on my part.
She's gone in the dark.
He's gone without a trace.
He's gone to the dove.
He disappeared from the surface of the earth.
Get out!
They killed it.
He knows them.
He knows them.
Knowledge of itself is the beginning of all wisdom.
We've known Tom for years.
I know him, but I don't know his name.
I know him, and that's why I don't believe him.
I know him very well because I've often seen him in his father's office.
I know his name.
I only know a few words.
I know her by name.
I know both girls.
I know the truth.
I know the right reason why you're here.
I know Tom's wife.
I know the area.
I know your younger brother very well.
Violence is a terrible crime.
You know me enough to know I wouldn't.
Do you know any of these men?

The captain's surprise left the ship.
She abused my ignorance.
I'm being abused.
You abuse your authority.
Destroy your enemies. Make them your friends.
You'll be happy again.
I told them to let the radio go.
I'll read it again.
The snow fell from the sky with rain.
Junction is another thing that I'm not very good at.
They packed it up.
They sing in the congregation.
She sang a song, she smiles at me.
She didn't come to me from the beginning.
The cat came under the writing table.
Two boys came out of the room.
The report on Tom's death upset me.
I've given him a lot of trouble.
She betrayed me. I'm disappointed.
The mature apple fell out of the tree.
I got hurt.
The mirror's ruined.
The mirror is frozen.
The mirror's broken.
They set up a new company in London.
I rarely see you and Tom.
I was just thinking about something.
I was just about to write a letter when he came home.
They ruined my life.
I'd destroy all the cattle if I could.
You cancelled the meeting.
You're breaking that advice.
You'll cancel the meeting.
She's been hit by her face.
We can get a lot of valuable information from that book.
You've been silenced.
I wouldn't make fun of that.
Tom's a man now.
He's wasting his time.
The loss of the job she loved so much was her wound.
We lost all our equipment.
He lost her.
I lost the rain that Tom gave me for my birthday.
I lost the rain that Tom gave me for my birthday.
I lost my key.
I lost all my friends.
You lost your head, didn't you?

You're wasting your time.
Losing the job she loved so much was a hard one for her.
She's smacked the knife.
They took part in this.
I took part in the debate.
I took part in the search.
I'd stay and talk, but I have to go.
They stayed in Tennessee.
We're still quiet.
Stay home.
Will you stay or will you leave?
Will you stay or will you leave?
Stay where you are, or I'll kill you.
Stay with us!
Stay here and shut the door.
Stay here!
Stay home and don't go anywhere.
Stay home.
I'll stay with her.
I'll stay in the motel.
I'm staying with you.
Awareness has won over me.
Raise your hands before you answer.
Get up from the chair and help!
We'll call you.
We'll handle it better.
Can you handle it yourself?
Can you handle it yourself?
Can you handle it yourself?
I chose the path of the slightest resistance.
My phone's ringing!
The bells are out.
The bells started ringing.
They made it.
I've turned my ankles.
We're used to everything.
I'm used to it.
It's a different kind of habit.
I used to live alone.
I used to win.
He's used to not having a hot meal every day.
You'll get used to it all.
You'll get used to it.
