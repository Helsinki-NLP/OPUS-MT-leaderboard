Petr Čech: Breakover to the last minute?
It's all possible.
Today is the last day when you can still skip the transfer window and make a big break.
Another chance will come in winter.
Petr Čech, currently replacement contractor Chelsea, is not sitting on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in the NH Hotel, talks with Czech journalists and is about to be represented by the Czech general in the game with the Americans and subsequently also at the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In the Chelsea branch, in the new season, Primer League is favored by Thibaut Courtois, Czech was first given a replacement position in ten years in the London club.
In time, it was speculated that the Czech might be interested in Real Madrid.
In the beginning of the season, the Spanish Superpohr lost in the battles with the Atlétika and failed to enter the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
It also speculated on the interest of Paris SG.
In the French league season, he held two games and two regiments, shot St. Etienne 5:0 on Sunday.
Relatively the most pressing shoe club AS Monaco.
He's got a 1-1-2 balance sheet in the woods, and at the weekend he broke up with Lille at 1:1 a.m.
Today, on bullfighting English websites, reports have come up that the Czech might want to be in Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, the Czech departure from Chelsea for the last time is not too likely.
Skybet wrote on him a 4-1 course.
Peter, is it possible that you will change your dress during the remaining few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never anything in the football.
Maybe during the day an offer will come that won't be rejected.
How would such an offer have to look?
(Laughter) "Well, I still don't know how such an offer that can't be rejected actually looks.
It would have to come to the agreement of all parties, above all, on Chelsea's position, whether or not the club would be able to deal with any offer.
Is it technically feasible to commit such an offence when you are in Prague now?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere else?
I didn't think about it.
But in such a situation, there are many players today, all of them are somewhere on the scene, and certainly there are still many violations to be closed today.
So somehow feasible would be certain.
How many clubs on the planet could they afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
So you're not pushing on the exit?
The situation that I didn't catch in the first three games of the new season is a new career for me after fifteen years.
But there's no reason to panic, pack and go somewhere.
I want to continue to participate in this fight about the position of the Chelsea branch and is on the coach who will decide what decision he will make over the next few weeks.
What role does family play in your decision?
I take all the factors into account.
Of course, sport is important to me, but I am looking at it from the personal page that family needs, of course.
Is it possible that you could catch another club in England?
That's the question I thought would never concern me.
But the football is all possible.
I don't want to rule out anything.
I don't know the answer.

Police in Karata arrested a 20-year-old boy after a motorcycle chase
The engine was stopped after the maximum speed of 70 km/h drove 125 km/h and drove to the woods to escape the police.
In the morning, the traffic police in Karrat tried to stop a blue engine by the coast, when they noticed that when they left at the Bathgate Road station, it was 125 km/h.
According to the police, the driver didn't stop and continue after Burgess Road and then he went to the bus, so the police lost him from surveillance.
The engine and the person who corresponded to the driver's description were then watched at the house at Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The Karath police accused a 20-year-old of disobeying the call for arrest and inadvertent treatment.
The court in Karrat will be held on 23 September.
The motorcycle was fun for three months.
George Webster accused of rape in hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
A man will be set up before the court for charges of rape against women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was charged with hearing the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
Apparently on 7 June 2013 in Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire County, she had to rape a woman.
According to the claim, Webster attacked her, while “she was unconscious, asleep, and unable to give her consent.”
In addition, Webster has been reached to rape other women at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn at the Scottish High School on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae has set the date of referral to the Supreme Court in Edinburgh on 17 November.
Renewal of a very American ideal that labour rights are at the same time human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law that is designed to protect civil rights in committees.
"According to the functioning of the committees, jobs work for the middle class," says Ellison, a democratic senator for Minnesota, who is co-chaired by the Congress Committee.
That's why I'm so proud that, together with the model of the occasional rights of John Lewis, I can introduce a law strengthening the position of employees.
This interim legislation gives workers the same legal opportunity to prevent discrimination in the organisation of committees, as in other forms of discrimination - and will put an end to counter-committee forces.
To amend the Labour Relations Act in such a way as to enable all employees who face discrimination, if they want to be involved in committees, to be tried before a civil court - and to judge compensation or compensation for damage - is a proper and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other designers are proposing in the law is to re-attack to the American ideal.
Even in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries - the Americans have sometimes supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember when the country had one breath of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of press, and right of assembly.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt the constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toy would be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their committees played a role in forming new Japan, including languages and openly acknowledged that "the right of employees to gather, to negotiate collectively and to act is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create an institution to ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by strong democracy.
The Germans realized that workers would need to organize and promote in a new nation and therefore included clauses that openly say: “The right to create societies that will ensure and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and to every call or profession.
The agreements which will restrict this right or attempt to harm it will be abolished. Measures leading to the fulfilment of this purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission for Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global treaty, the authors and Roosevelt guaranteed that "every person has the right to create and enter committees within the framework of the protection of his interests."
The entire American generation has assumed the basic assumption that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create working committees - and their participation in collective negotiations with companies and government agencies in the position of an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are attacked in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that workers must have the right to organize and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Everyone today knows that the forces of the nation have not diminished, but they have expanded it.
They raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry and brought production to an unprecedented level.
Those who attack the committees forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn't forget, and we shouldn't.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination in the organization of committees - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that led America and made it a real commitment to democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked the law that could close all the abortion clinics in Louisiana
The federal judge temporarily blocked the Lousian law on Sunday, which, according to lawyers, was likely to close all five state-run clinics.
The order signed by Louisian Governor Bobby Jindala in June, which is in force on 1 September, would require doctors to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital up to 30 miles away from their practice.
The judgment of the judge means that doctors may temporarily continue to carry out legal losses and must, in the meantime, take care of this permit.
"The proposed party will be able to carry out its activities legally and, in the meantime, obtain permission," says Federal Judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be planned within one month so that the judge can issue a more lasting resolution on the law.
Activists for the right to lose the resolution, which is the last in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said that doctors would be given more time to obtain permission.
"Today's decision assures women in Louisiana that they will be safe from a law that is to be prepared for their health and rights," declared Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Centre for Reproduction Rights, who, on behalf of three of the five clinics, sought to block the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision concerned doctors from two clinics that were not between the complainants, and they also requested that this authorisation be granted.
Louisiana is one of the eleven states that have passed similar laws, and the courts in Alabama and Mississippi have declared such measures to be anti-constitutional.
Key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in the state, blocked the federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for women's right to be kidnapped together with the Association of American Orphans and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association claim that the need to have this permit imposes on a doctor requirements that are not necessary from a medical point of view.
The protestors objected to the fact that the measures were intended to protect women's health and some also welcomed the closure of the clinics because of the measures.
The centre for reproductive rights has stated that only one doctor is allowed to lose in Louisiana.
If all the doctors in the state were forced to stop carrying out the abortions, this doctor would also be afraid of his safety, the group said.
The Louisian authorities indicated in their response that they would not punish the doctors who executed the losses while waiting for an application to be heard for the grant of rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, more frequent ovaries are killed in outdoor cancer.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video containing their deceased mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at greater risk of dying of egg cancer than their opponents in the city.
Researchers analyzed medical records of more than 1,100 Australians diagnosed in 2005 with ovarian cancer and found that only 35% lived five years after diagnosis.
Susan Jordan's QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute reported that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New medicines can slow lung and egg cancer
Women's researchers have been monitoring treatment for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the chance of survival affected the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing disease and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate was observed in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at an advanced stage.
In rural and remote countries, women were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than in urban women.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that factors can be late diagnosis and poor access to treatment.
"Unpowerable is the best way to treat gynecooncologists who usually live in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving medical services at a distance that should overcome a barrier in the form of a distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen the transport service that allows specialists to treat women close to their homes and programs to support people who are being treated far away from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan declared that the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low in terms of geographical location, which highlights the need for better treatment and preventive programmes.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer today publishes the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, in her 33 year old mother, Elish Neave, from the city of Gold Coast, was diagnosed with aggressive form of egg cancer.
Gardening centers regret a reduction in the number of owners of houses
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, a decrease associated with the extraordinary housing of owners of young people 35 years of age could lead to the achievement of the "main age groups of gardeners" of up to ten million pounds per year.
According to the report, people who rent their homes lose their gardens on average 55 % of the amount that they lose in their homes.
As other dangerous factors in the sector, which earns an estimated five billion pounds a year, indicate an increase in the number of people living in very urbanised areas, where there are no gardens, the form of parking spaces, and the size of the gardens.
In the area of Great London, where the share of owned houses fell over the period of six years from 61% to 43%, the lowest expenditure on garden products in Britain is one household.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Company have stated that housing in a basement or a lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the main garden advisor for RHS, said: “The tenants have a very popular flowering plant - when they move, plants can take along with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of home owners and economic prosperity ranging from 80 to mid 90.
He also predicted a higher break this year due to better weather, which came under adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator says democracy.
After Putin struck his youth organization, which reminds me of the most important thing, he saved with atomic weapons and basically revealed to everyone that their opinions were stolen from him, gave us today a lecture on democracy.
But I feel like the current regime in Russia is showing a lot of drawings of a fascist state.
The great nations have one common one, and that's that they can control both drunk nationalism and that the minority complex can transform into imperialist chutes.
The time of the east is probably different than the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of the war on rule over Europe was long gone , on the contrary in the east it thought that they had been looked at for a long time and it is necessary to regain their international position .
Such a mood and frustration ruled Germany in the thirties, just before the Nazi power was captured, followed by the explosion of nationalism in Russia today's unparalleled situation.
And then the completely consistent cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the elimination of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, is quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly many of the Russians, is about to fall after the time when Russia ruled half the world and the second part was shaking in front of them.
Perhaps Western politicians blamed themselves, perhaps a little of Vladimir’s whimpering on his shoulder, perhaps not inviting him to his place of interest, and perhaps starting to underestimate him, and he was simply acting like a typical Russian man.
He made an order at home, he pretended that he didn't even want to go anywhere and brushed the knife at home.
Now he's decided he'll get the lost position back.
It starts slowly, it's time.
The leader's probably alive, so where would he go?
The Kavkasana slag, now the Ukrainians slag, then they're in a row of pobalt slags.
The Russian bear has been in the skin for a long time.
He's gonna notice that, too, China, which kind of jumps out, and he's definitely making a look at the far east.
And those Germans of the Vladimir are also pretty shitty as they're good, and that's what I put in their 45 ass.
That's how to make a new Novosia in Karl's Varech.
It would be the base and ours there are many and how they're being drowned and the Dutch have already wanted to get the liquefy out of them.
Our veterans have long remembered the way they had in Czechoslovakia.
Now the vote is their Prime Minister, Mr. Sobotka, who is so soft, he can rob himself like a brick and sleep all over their EU.
That'd be so fun to jump on big Russia.
They need to remember where their place is.
And as a blast, we'll use our roommates who live in their territory.
There's plenty of Russians everywhere, and when they say they're being drowned out there, they're just being drowned out there, and we don't let that happen, we're protecting them.
And the Russian will rule again, for what the other is born.
Europe is good only as a proposal on which proud Ivan can dance goat.
Turkey called an American diplomat for the Spanish report
The Turkish Foreign Minister called on the country's highest-ranking US diplomat to explain the report on the American and British espionage activity in Turkey.
The vice-president of the government of Bulent said that the US charge d'affaires and Turkish state officials had been working on the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and The Intercept stated that according to the documents provided by the former analyst of the US National Security Agency, Turkey was the priority target of US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been baggagetising the importance of the report and has declared that all important states are monitoring each other.
The senior report, which also referred to the German intelligence service, called for a more heated response from the Turkish government.
Series Game of Thrones presents another fourth row tricks
The creators of the Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted about the creation of a fourth row of tricks.
The most visible are the computer adaptations of the serial environment and the mass scene, when the army of the famous Daenerys will become from the noise of the soldiers.
Police Director in Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the complainants submitted evidence of expulsion from police officers and civil servants in the private sector of Calvia to the Mallorian State Prosecutor's Office.
The chief of police in Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after the charges brought by the entrepreneurs and bar owners in the unrecognised party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after he was charged with corruption by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, a street where there is a majority of bars and night business in Magaluf.
According to the Internet newspaper Mallorca Diario, the complainants submitted evidence of excommunication from police officers and state council officials in Calvia's self-government prosecutor's office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish state police for associating with corruption charges and, together with Navarre, they were heard by the judge.
The Spanish national journal ABC quoted the unsatisfied owners of night business, according to which the public authorities have a significant impact on their business.
“It’s not about making money, it’s about survival,” said one of the entrepreneurs in the court.
Don't play with our life.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf arrived on the main news page around the world after a video of eighteen-year-old British tourists appeared on YouTube, which during the bar tour provided oral sex to 24 men.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to keep an eye on the drinkers and sprinklers in a number of participants in the holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of unrecognizable alcoholic tours by bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where there has been an event with oral sex, was forced to close for a year and, together with tour organizers, to pay Carnage's bar fee of 55,000 euros ($73 000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is particularly popular in Britain, was also a witness of many alcohol-related accidents including fashion waves known as "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day marked by rain and storms that had an impact on the airport at Adelaide
JARO brought the south of South Australia an ice surprise, came with a strong rain and strong wind, which seriously hit the airport in Adelaide.
The next 5 mm drops will fall in the city until nine o'clock in the evening and the next 6,6 mm will fall during the night of the week.
The last rain came along with a few short bumps associated with the storm and wind currents that began eight hours ago and brought nearly 4 mm of precipitation in about ten minutes.
After a few early spring doses came after winter last week, temperatures dropped again on Monday in the city at only 15.8 °C.
It is believed that storm weather has contributed to the late Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was to land at 19:30, but a change in speed or direction of the wind caused it to delay the landing.
Wind currents at Adelaide airport at the time reached the ground at about 50 km/h.
The flight data showed that the plane had to leave from second landing and finally reached about 20:40.
The delay of the aircraft subsequently led to the delay of the next years, including the flight of Emirates from Dubai and the flight of Qantas from Sydney.
According to the forecast, the temperature in Adelaide will reach a maximum of 16 °C in Tuesday and one or two can occur.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the area near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in anti-bomb shelters, while the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas attacked their homes with rockets and mines. However, schools in Gaza remain closed while the territory is remembered for the war.
The beginning of the school brought to the community in southern Israel the marked attacks of joy and excitement, but the signs of the battle are still visible.
In Ashdoda, a town in the south of the country, the school staff who hit the rocket removed the remains behind the cracks and were allowed to wait for the return of the children.
"We're a little scared, but otherwise we're happy," said Ronit Bart, a native of the Saad kibucu and an English teacher at the local school.
A lot of kids in this area really need to get back to routine every day.
Her eleven-year-old daughter, Shani Bartová, said that "it's a bit strange" to go back to school.
"We lived a few difficult moments and we didn't even leave the house," she said.
Kibuc, located near the border with Gaza, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer support to the population.
Until the ceasefire last week of the war ended, thousands of border residents like Saad left their homes or homes and moved to safer areas away from Gaza to avoid rockets and mines.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a village close to the border with Gaza, where she shot a four-year-old boy from the Palestinian Minomet, with a return of weight.
The Minister of Education has stated that about twelve families have not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in replacement schools.
The president of the Benjamin Netanyahu government visited the school in Sderot, a town on the border with Gaza, which was severely hit by the Palestinian fire.
He urged his children to study diligently, and he added: “We will assure you of education and security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on a timeless peace last Tuesday.
The ceasefire, however, did not resolve the key problems as Hamas' demand for the end of the Israeli-Egypt blockade of Gaza and the reconstruction of the airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the armed forces of Hamas and the return of two soldiers who fell into battle.
The new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to the estimates of Palestinians and the United Nations, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of which civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel doubts and estimates that at least half of the killed were radical, although there is no clear evidence for this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including Thai workers, died.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired 4 591 rockets from mines in the Israeli cities, especially in the southern part of the country.
The Israeli army has again engaged in over 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and the estimated 250,000 people hid in hundreds of UN schools, which had become a temporary shelter.
Because of the tens of thousands of people who still remain in hiding, and because of the ongoing struggles, they postponed the school officials last week early in the school year.
"I hope that they will soon open the school so that we can complete education as well as Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from the school in the largest city of Gaza.
I'm standing in front of Vácho.
And Lafatu treats temperatures
The Czech football team met this afternoon in Prague before the U.S. mid-preparation match and the subsequent start-up of the European Championships against the Netherlands.
From the twenties of the frame, there are problems with the spartan attacker David Lafata, who is suffering from the heat.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was about more players, and David probably has a little more problems.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," said Coach Pavel Vrba to reporters.
"If it will be two or three days, or if it will fit tomorrow, it will be seen according to his health status, which our doctor will decide on," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course, someone has a disease, but it's not that they can't practice or participate in a fight Wednesday with the United States," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday night, Vrba called as the last player of the Spartan hostage Lukas Vách.
He assumed that it was not easy to make decisions, considering other middlemen.
I decided that Lucas is a prospective player, 25 years old.
It was very difficult to decide, but I am behind it," Vrba said to Vácho.
What about Shural?
We'll see what's going to happen to Latato.
It is not excluded that in the case of health problems, appointments could still change.
On the weekend with a great performance, for example, the liberal Josef Šural, who gave the hattrick, said.
Of course, there are players who have been showing shape lately.
We'll see how David Lafata's on it.
In the event that he cannot be available on Wednesday, I do not claim that I cannot nominate any of the players who are interested in the Czech league," Vrba said.
This afternoon, the representative of the training team is waiting for us on Tuesday, then the classic pre-recorded training team ahead of the US duel in the summer, which will be open to fans and then follow the autograph.
Fighting with the Americans is on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team in it will strive for a prize victory under the Vrba.
In the previous three preparatory matches, he won two rebates and lost one.
The qualifying match with the Netherlands is then on the 9th of September since 20:45.
The foot goes to Italy in the Netherlands
The point is, he likes to have more time to train than previous meetings.
It's an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can practice certain things that we need not have much time before.
Now we will be able to focus on preparing for the Netherlands as best we can," praised Vrba.
The Dutch will present themselves before the match in Prague on Thursday in Italy, and the duel will personally monitor the former temporary representative of Josef Pešice.
Gives us information that's from the fight.
But it's not just about him, we're gonna have a fight and a fight and we're gonna split it up.
A new coach comes to the Netherlands, we will see what changes there will be," Vrba told bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to the highly monitored housing price statistics in the winter period, the last seven years have increased most.
According to an index of the value of apartments in the Australian capital RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic grew by 1,1 % in August of the housing price, as stated by the agency on Monday.
The increase led to a total increase in red, June and August to 4,2 %, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase fell to 10.9%, more than doubled for one year by August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
The research director of the RP Data Tim Lawless stated that Sydney and Melbourne are leading the market.
The RP Data figures show that the prices of apartments in Sydney increased by 16,1 % last year, while prices in Melbourne by 11,7 %.
Among the other most powerful markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with an increase in prices averaged between five and six percent.
On the other hand, Canberra, which was damaged by the State-designated cost reduction and where prices increased only by 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that when the spring began, the number of properties for sale increased in the following months, which will be the market for "real test".
‘In view of the continuing high level of auction sales, generally high sales rates and low interest rates, the value of housing is likely to increase even more over the next three months,’ he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never said, "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
With his father, who died when Henry was 19, who worked in the factory, they had a colder relationship.
Henry is testing comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and melodies is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with a few unpleasant childhood memories.
After her mother's death, Henry went through "deep" therapy and now she's thinking about her relationship with her father.
He knew very little about him.
You have never seen his face, but you have heard his voice: “Stop this frame.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to look at the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton -- when I was a child, they were grown up -- went to the bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a glass of beer or a beautiful stroke in the cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
Most of my life it was a serious guy in a corner reading the newspaper.
Henry recently visited Dudley's barn, and although conditions were better than in his father's time, he looked at what life had to be for him.
There's more light in there today, but it's still dark, smoked, cloudy labyrinth, where the flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and thirst.
Dad always went into the bathroom and was just lying there, and then he heard how slowly he started singing for himself, because he was laughing at the plumbing.
When I went around, I realized he was doing this year to enjoy his family, and I started to respect him more.
Even so, Henry lived a childhood without parental love.
Dad never hugged anyone, said "I love you."
When Mom was sick and died, we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, who has Dawn French, made it possible for him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop "I love you"?
Don't keep hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
With French, who has been married for 25 years, they're still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot of, a lot of weight and started to show signs of diabetes, the doctor said to me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to the big fitness center and I also had to keep a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
It's a waste of time.
No one wants to eat the carrot itself.
Changes in the direction of taking Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, briefly cut beard.
After receiving recognition from his criticism of Othell, he went down to the theater.
Comedy followed with mistakes and August Wilson's fleet.
It's a different experience than sitcomy and comedy that filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed him on the stage as he paraded someone, and he wrote about him at the talent competition in New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-70s: “I’ve been the only black copyist/combinant on TV for a long time.”
He learned to walk.
In addition to the fact that I had to be noticed by the public, I also had to learn from the years 1975 and 1985 how to think about acting jokes, being a star and being on TV, and it was really difficult.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
In view of the fact that his manager owned the right to show production The Black and White Minstrel Show, the entertainment program in which the players were dressed as blacks, Henry finally came out with his comedy for five years.
My family was no longer there for it.
I wish it never happened, but I don't want it.
Even though it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was "years and years appreciated the main product of British television", but was also "grotic parody of blacks."
In the 1980 ’ s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and represented figures that at the same time ridiculed and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began to be broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was also known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comical series Chef!.
For decades, he received ads, documents, television shows and roles in films, but after sending his Lenny Henry.tv to BBC in 2008, he said, "What you're going to do now, Lene, it seems like you've got stuck in one place, or you're getting a little off the road."
Next in line was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergy to Shakespeare.
We didn't study him properly at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
All those with whom we had a conversation, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get used to it if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all like Shakespeare so much.
Henry gave Othello's final 20-line speech for the document, and he's already in it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it's giving me the courage.
“That’s it. It’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn text, find out something about it.
So the test was hard, and I've been reading the game for months and months before.
And it was a success.
Looks like they're waiting for a leak, which didn't happen.
Soon he started playing the wrong game in Comedy.
I was in the National Theatre all of a sudden, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical competition, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for entertaining the audience.
“The voice in my head said, ‘Before the computer is fixed, you have to have them for ten minutes now.’”
Instead, the director announced that the performance will continue as soon as the problem is resolved.
I left the scene and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve this for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry in Plottech in the Dukess Theatre
Learning the Plot text was a challenge.
Panic's pretty good, he's making a decision.
The game was also well accepted, so it's like God's sign that says, "This is what you should do."
Of course, that's what he says by the voice of the expert.
So I'm staying with it.
I really like it.
I'm happy in the experiment.
Henry, however, remains a comedian brain - throughout our conversation interrupts with humorous performances when he comes in and out of the role of the simulator.
I decided not to make a stand-up because having the satisfaction of the room full of foreigners is a bit dangerous, I would say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get to the blind alley.
Sometimes, if I want, I do live at the Apollo, but I don't like it as before.
I was wondering if he'd ever set up a stand-up tour.
The joy of this sitting in one room with the director who helps to outline the beginning, the means and the end of the journey - I don't think I would ever want to give up on it.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I'm having fun.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers state officials to pay attention to non-existent employees
Kenya started a biometric registration of all her state officials to try to get rid of the government's payroll of no employees.
According to the Government, employees who are not registered in the following two weeks will cease to receive payment.
The government believes that thousands of people are paid even after they leave the state service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhur Kenyatta pledged that he would prevent corruption in government.
The audit carried out this year showed that the State is coming monthly for at least one million dollars (700,000 pounds) on the payments of non-existent employees and in the event of another abuse of official power.
The government suspects that payments are still included in bank accounts and after the death of the employee or after the employee leaves the government, a BBC reporter from the capital of Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri, reported.
All state officials must be provided within the next two weeks to the identification centres, where their biometric data will be recorded, shall be reported in the government declaration.
He goes on to say that anyone who doesn't leave without enough an apology will be removed from the payroll.
"By teaching the actual public service employees this measure will make a significant contribution to its disposal and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waigur, Secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for "screaming" against the government
Local media reports that 33 police officers were detained in Turkey for suspicion of "fighting against the government".
The police department has not commented on the case yet.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, fourteen high officials were detained.
Some of them were involved in the December investigation of corruption, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organising a criminal gang and phone-response.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time the president of the government) marked their actions as part of the role of Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gulen against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1st) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents and the president of the government of Arsenij Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he informed the journalists present that not all schools had reopened, but that it was decided to defend the country for the next generation:
Not at all schools, a traditional ceremony took place on the 1st of July.
Not throughout Ukraine there is peace.
We have to fight for peace.
The entire Ukraine, a united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukov, a teacher at the school in Slavyanska, visited Jaceňuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain the knowledge that will benefit them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated in such a way that children wear fancy shirts, bring balloons and flowers to their teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, maybe the BBC found the boss for hard times.
Take with you a cloud of fame from the banking world, media management and internal conclave of the conservative party.
He's got experience from the front lines.
The career began in the consulting company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and into the Pearsons media world.
She was the executive director of the Financial Times for seven years. She registered on the post when Pearson's senior member of the parent company had her younger colleague.
It's said that her distance was close to a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former director of BP, when Cameron in Whitehall needed a private expertise: she became a consultant to the government.
Her husband is an ex-member of the City Council.
In May, I described the director's work as a chalice with poison.
Not only is the BBC an extensive and complex entity in the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation is turning in two directions: inside to the top level of the hierarchy of the BBC's own leadership, but also out to the public in times of unrest when things don't work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that requires a thorough reform.
Which manager would risk coming to a company complex as a Chinese Dynasty, tearing it apart and preparing itself for work.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, a lot of people would like to see how the BBC decreases - its power, its finances - and how its status is revised.
With the expansion of the competition circle and the new technology questioning the old security, the immediate negotiation of concessionary fees for the BBC is a major threat.
For a modest amount of 145,50 pounds a year, the British public buys a share in something that is certainly the largest media company in the world.
The BBC reports a good story: it claims that its production is 96% household and each one is only 40 p.m. per day.
In addition, the BBC format clearly stands: 53% of beneficiaries compared to 31% ten years ago.
The BBC service usage models have changed: Today I have news headlines displayed on my mobile phone and on the lines I've been browsing, I can look at iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a very loving and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry claims that the insulting tweet did not approve
Tweet from the official Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, who was published on Sunday, contained an insulting image of a democratic state representative who initiated Perry's criminal charge of abuse of power.
Tweet was later decomposed and on Perry's account was published another one that distanced from the previous.
My account left a tweet that was not authorized.
"I disagree with the tweet and I picked it up," he said in another post.
Perry's assistants didn't answer the questions immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is in fact responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet published an unscrupulous, humorous picture of the State representative of Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay for her office, which Perry, a potential candidate for the president in the 2016 elections, brought this month before the great jury in Austin.
The tweet stated: “I don’t always drive three times as much alcohol in the blood as I’m allowed... but when I do, I regret that Governor Perry calls me to be responsible for it.”
I'm the most filmed Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perrym was not conducted by the Lehmberg Authority.
He was in charge of Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonia, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent, and the charge was called a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the charge, because the application of the laws to reach the court as long as the governor serving in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry interrupted the payment of $7.5 million from the State Fund for the Department of Public Interest, which is based in Travis County and is responsible for corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The refusal resulted in a formal complaint from a left-to-right group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes even celebrates.
After he finished his presidential campaign in 2012 at the fifth place on the committee of his party in Iowa, Perry replied to the speculation that he could already finish with his own photo, saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market returns to normal
One of the most prominent London development companies warned that the housing market in southeastern England had returned to the normal level of activity.
Housing in the capital was the subject of high demand and rising prices and increased concerns from credit bubbles led to the introduction of mortgage limits in June of England.
On Monday, Tony Pidgley, the founder and president of the Berkeley Development Company, said: "The market has returned to the normal level of the transaction since the beginning of the current financial year from the top point in 2013." He adds that it provides "a stable environment for functioning."
The London housing market was good during the decline because the buyers from abroad sailed to the main city.
According to the Catastrophe Authority, prices in the city increased by 18,5 % only last year, with a distance of 6,7 % in England and all of Wales.
Average sales prices of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about five last year and rose to 423,000 pounds at the end of April.
However, because of the stronger books, it is not so attractive for foreign buyers of London's property in recent months - some of them also threatened the introduction of new property taxes and the possible "seasonal taxes" that politicians came with before the parliamentary elections next May.
The London real estate office Foxtons warned last week that a April review of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter loan rules, would also slow the market growth rate during the second half of the year for sale of properties and prices.
The new Bank of England data showed a decrease in the number of approved mortgages per month in June, indicating that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate office, has reduced, on the basis of the fact that home prices have already begun to decline, their forecast growth in London real estate prices for 2015 to 3%.
The volume of transactions according to the real-time WA Ellis office in the London's most expensive districts, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, decreased by a quarter each year.
However, the demand for residence in the capital for the blessing of Berkeley has increased cash for forward sales to more than 2.2 billion pounds.
Piggley added: “The demand for the right, good-looking housing in the good location remained the same and, thanks to this, the forward sale was maintained.”
In June, the company announced that it sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the end of the crisis in 2007.
Annual profit before tax increased by 40% to 380 million pounds, 18% to 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday before the annual meeting of Pidgley, it was predicted that the annual yield of Berkeley would be in line with the current market expectation.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be 450 million pounds.
Berkeley's stock stopped at the London Stock Exchange this afternoon on 23.96 pounds.
Hacker on the Internet posted photos of our Jennifer Lawrence
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th anniversary of the Cen Academy.
Photos by Oscar Jennifer Lawrence escaped online because of a hacker who claimed to have a "list" picture of another hundred starting toys.
"Hunger Games" spokespersons confirmed that Lawrence's photos were right and hacker criticised "the obvious violation of privacy."
The authorities have already been contacted and will reach out to anyone who steals photos of Jennifer Lawrence's public.
The hacker photos that were originally published on the 4chan image sharing server were reportedly obtained thanks to the interface in the Apple iCloud internet storage system. The alleged list of photos of hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanny, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, however, the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim Against the Rest of the World" Winsteado also criticised on Twitter.
"I hope that those of you who are looking at pictures that we had arranged with your husband years ago in a private home are satisfied with themselves," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, however, is familiar with the cable TV series Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied that the photos were right. On Twitter she said: "These my alleged naked photos are PODVRH, people."
It's better to use it even in a crack.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday evening that the speakers of the Ariany Grande pop stars denied that the alleged photographs would be true.
Extraordinary exhibition from the renowned new novel Howard Jacobson about the love and the letter "J"
They got divorced, that's the best way to describe it, gradually spread out as a box that someone left on the rain.
From time to time, a woman told him that she was too serious, complicated, rigid, isolated, and perhaps a little shy.
And then she shakes his hand.
He just let himself be.
He was able to pee like a bear, yeah.
The last sacrifice of this ability was the beginning of a loving bond, which more than she usually promised to remove him from the loneliness of life and perhaps give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wildly hot hair and a heart-broken village on the northern island, which was even farther and more hospitable than Port Reuben.
She came to the south with an older company that Kevern thought was her aunt, who inherited property in a wet, but beautiful valley called, perhaps, the Paradise Valley.
No one's been in the house for a few years.
The pipes said, there were dead spiders in the baths, the skirmishers signed out on the windows, as if they thought it belonged to them, the garden was crowded and the mud reminded of the huge heads of desire.
The house looked like a chaloupe from childhood stories, scary and at the same time charming, with a full secret garden.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations at the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shorter selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailin sat on the dissipating chairs in long grass and held their hands, used unexpectedly a warm spring afternoon, were inadvertently charging the public station that the country had stored a pleasant music and soothing news, when in that regard he remembered an old song of a long forgotten black comic that his father loved to listen to by hidden rollers.
You've got too big feet.
Because of their natural aggression, such songs on the radio have not been played.
They weren't forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - they just didn't play.
They helped them get to the deuce, as well as the word deuce.
People's taste has proved what they would never have been able to do without the law, and like people with books, they choose memoirs in which the poor become rich, cooks and lovers, so they choose ballads in music.
The cavern was cut off on the day and began to play on the imaginary piano and the rough, comical voice singing the series of Alline's big feet.
Ailin's incapacitated.
"It was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fatse Waller," he said and automatically added two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to push his letter out of his mouth.
It started out like a game when he was a kid.
His father told him that the game was playing with his father.
When you said what started on it, you didn't get two fingers in front of your mouth, you got five.
It wasn't very funny and it wasn't funny right now.
He just knew it was expected of him, it was all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailin's never heard of anyone.
No jazz, even though he wasn't directly built out of law, they didn't play.
The improvisation came out of fashion.
There was only one place in life for one "if."
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know exactly where it was going to end.
The same in humor.
His inescapability went to people's nerves.
And jazz was a humour expressed in song.
Although he had not heard of Sammy Davis Junior for up to ten years, Kevern knew the jazz from his father's seminal collection of old CDs.
At least Alilin didn't have to say that Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she could not remember the time when the songs were not black.
Also without laws or pressure.
Allowable society is one in which every part of it is grateful - with the gratitude of those who were fortunately saved - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of African-Caribbean origin with temperaments and constitutions danced for entertainment and athletics, and so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, like the nature of the electronics supply, took responsibility for not having a family without a functional phone.
The rest of the dishes were installers, the Greeks, the rest of the dishes were wrong.
Those of the states of the Persian Gulf and Levant, whose ancestors quickly did not leave the country, while doing so, COSE STALO, KDYBY SE STALO - feared that they would be accused of adding to the fire, in fact afraid that the fire would soon be spent - opened the restaurant where the labs were being sold and smoked the water baths, ignored themselves and the inaction slowly fed them.
To everyone according to his talent.
Since she only listened to the ballads, Ailin found it hard to understand how the simple words that Kavern just sang to her could produce music.
Music was the expression of love.
"They're really not easy," said Kevern.
Maybe just for people who have too big legs.
My father never hurt anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden added a safe illusion.
Not even a word could be avoided after the soundtracks.
Ailin still didn't get it.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he managed to put two fingers in his mouth again in her presence.
She thought it was weird.
"She felt funny," he finally said.
Unbelievably she shook her head and slammed Kevin's face.
There was nothing else in the whole world but the mutilation of her Hebrew hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think," she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She looked really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
It didn't go so far.
Maybe a little bit of ankles...
You're saying you hate me because I have too thick ankles?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles just attract me," he tried.
I'm kind of vulnerable.
That didn't happen.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he lost the magic needed to be able to cut off the cruelty that was in the jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel.
Maybe he was deliberately cruel Kavern.
In spite of the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomon's broom and got up out of bed, broke the radio and poured unripe wine.
No wine, so he couldn't drink for it.
She seemed to be shaking like a palm leaf in the storm in her dismay.
"I'm very attracted to you being an asshole," she said...
Except it doesn't bother me.
She felt sorry for him both for his unpleasant words and for the fear she had in her eyes when she stood up against him.
Did you think she'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but she didn't doubt that it was the same as it was here on the grounds.
The same broad and ice ocean was worried about them.
The same awakening of men, then, COSE STALO, even more unbearable and bitter than their ancestors, pastors and cassettes, bluffed from the house to the house, prepared to raise their hand against any woman who would dare to refuse them or mock them.
Stupid?
If he doesn't pay attention, they'll show her their fingers!
First of all, helping her - helping her became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the opposite of soft ballads about love that radio screamed - first of all, they helped her, then one murder.
According to Kever's opinion, too much cultivation, because anointing was about itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons didn't literally tell him to leave.
He got up from bed like an old man.
She felt faint herself, but the pain of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She watched him leave -- as if she watched him from the window on the floor -- the man who realized what he was doing.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart was broken for him and for all the men in general, regardless of the fact that a few of them had left her.
The man turned away from it, his shoulder hung, humiliated, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she think that this view was well known, even though she could not afford the only moment until today that she would ever see it?
Ailin Solomons, on her own, looked at her feet.
Some 20 years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic two-year researcher working in Ofnow, a non-statutory monitoring system of the Public Order, prepared a brief article on the persistence of mild and moderate violent acts in areas where his reconciliation or direct suspension was expected to be the most important if enough money and energy were to be installed on his removal.
“It has done a lot and a lot more to do it”, she wrote, “to calm down the native aggression of people who fought in many battles and most of them won, and above all in the busy, difficult places of the country, where even through the peaks of church towers coming out over the living areas of the flood of human kindness, only rarely appeared.”
Some things, however, are irretrievable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the pudding.
Citizens breathe over sentimental balloons, mock unfortunate stories, and declare that they believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas, old brutality is held as hard as in urban agglomerations, but evidence also shows that at home, in the workplace, roads and even in sports games, new and aggressive hostility is emerging.
"Unfortunately you have a tendency to be too kind," said her supervisor.
I'd suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum turned her head off.
I also have to ask myself: Are you an atheist?
"I feel I don't have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme has regained her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Keep it quiet.
"That's why I'm not asking," Rabinowitz finally said, "that I have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have any prejudices at this workplace.
We serve unaccompanied companies.
But some kind of hypersensitivity, which is completely acceptable and commendable to itself, can sometimes paint a judgment as you have suggested.
Obviously, you are alone in the Church - things that you call "crown" and "brutal" could also be interpreted as an expression of natural power and energy.
Keep solving what's going on, so that's going to happen, as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, preparing the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz was talking, Esme Nussbaum was looking around.
On his head in the light table, there was a pink light on the recommendation that Onow sent to the world in the last quarter or more.
Smile at your neighbor, watch your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the musicians, use your phone, chat, explain, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than talking, singing is better than writing, but there is nothing better than love.
"I totally understand your excuses," replied the quiet Esme Nussbaum, when she was sure that her superior had ended, "and I don't claim that the morning was not as bad as we say she was.
My first concern is that if we are not warned in advance, we repeat the same mistake that led to the CO SE STALO, KDYBY'S STALO.
This time, however, we will not fantasize about others.
Luther Rabinowitz tied his fingers together.
That was supposed to mean endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you describe the steps that may have been taken and may not have been made by your ancestors, you describe them as mistakes.
You're too far away to talk about ventilating your "fate" and "infidelity" on the "other."
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and in protecting our presence, we are not talking about us and about them.
There were no "we" and there were no "them."
All we know is that it was chaotic times.
"In the course of which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme took courage, "we are no one without guilt.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, it happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add - we agree on this together.
And just like there's no guilt that could be committed to anyone, there's no thing that should be corrected, no matter if the repair was appropriate and possible.
But what is the past but that we may learn from it?
There's a past to forget about.
If there's anything I can add to that--
Luther Rabinowitz spread his fingernails.
"I will take your message into consideration," he said and missed it.
The day she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who hired her on a walkway in a way that they described as "brut and brutal."
Accidents are happening.
The army of the Kingdom of Lesoth claims that there is no plan - the president of the government remains in South Africa
The military officials of the Kingdom of Lesotho denied that they would organize a march for the purpose of disarming the government, claiming that they were acting against the police suspected of attempting to arm the political fanatics.
The president of the government, Thomas Thabane, fled the country and said that the army surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
After he declared that he was being threatened by death, the prime minister and his family moved to the neighboring South African Republic.
Major Ntlele Ntoi's speech army said that in fact it was not about a riot, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics", which the police tried to arm themselves.
"This morning, the command of the defenders of the Kingdom of Lesotha acted after receiving several information services reports, that in a number of police there are several groups that are planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who are going to make a move in the country," said the Voice of America.
The Yugoslav government spoke, Clayson Monyela said military action looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has declared that the government has taken over by force, it is clear that the actions of the Lesothian defence components bear the mark of the coup," he said.
The military representatives of the kingdom of Lesotho said that on Sunday the soldiers returned to their wives and were at peace in the main city.
During the Thaban's absence, he will be the government of Deputy Prime Minister Mothejo Metsing.
Thabane said in his opinion that he was the target of an attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane has suspended Parliament's session for internal disputes, Lesotho has been in tension.
He declared that despite the opposing claims, he was not undermining his government.
Production in the euro area is at a minimum of thirteen months
Production growth has slowed down to a minimum of thirteen months, according to a carefully monitored survey in August in the euro area.
The final index of purchasing managers in the euro area (PMI) of June 51.8 fell to 50.7 in August.
A number greater than 50 means expansion.
There were new orders and the factory damaged the growing tension between the EU and Russia for Ukraine.
The figures come from the fourth meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will require a clear plan from the bank to deal with the remote recovery of the euro area and with a risk of inflation falling to 0,3 %.
It has appeared to be speculation that the Director of the ECB Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he is considering the quantitative release of the euro area, similar to what the United Kingdom and the United States joined in the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than any growth, the braking effect that has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on the manufacturer is still more visible," said Rob Dobson, chief economist Markit.
Germany's production of SMEs, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to a minimum of 11 months.4
In the second largest economy in the area, France, SMEs fell to 46.9.
The concern is about France, Italy has gone over the expansion of the stagnation.
The fact that the moving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands has disappeared is also not too reassuring," said Dobson.
The slowdown of the industry is likely to lead to a fire by analysts expecting the implementation of other monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where SMEs grew to 57,3 at the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, a leading economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the production of shopping managers for August is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
Added: At present, the euro area producers have a very complex life, because increasing geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - add even more uncertainty to the increasingly demanding conditions in many countries.
These increases in uncertainty have proved to be effective - and above all the consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially those costly.
He stated that as "even more likely" appears that the ECB will finally have to implement some form of quantitative release, "though we expect it to be limited."
Ten years of hell survivors from Beslan: Ten years from the threat from the vast school of children still suffer
Ten years ago, the Czech radicals at the school in Beslan in southern Russia were held hostage by thousands of people
During the three days of suffering and the shock of the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death during the animal service at school.
Just ten years after the terrible siege of the school in Beslan, in which 334 people, including 186 children, were killed, were warned last night by the surviving heroes before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, the children and parents were captured and murdered by fanatic terrorists, it seemed to be the deepest bottom of hell.
The resistance to the tragedy linked the east and the west, which in this catastrophic accident led to a conversation and a future.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the religious course of school.
We have found wonderful young people who have suffered calamity, even though the memory of hell - caused terrorists will live on in them.
What's their greatest wish?
That the war that now destroys Ukraine - and in which children like them die - would be over.
A girl trying to get back into a destroyed school gym
She was captured by the leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov, just trying to get back into the bombed school gym after the bomb exploded in her.
The confused Aida desperately was looking for her mother, Larissa, who is now forty.
They panicked that they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"My wife told me to run away and save my life, but I couldn't," said Aida once.
I had my legs from blood.
I got up and came back to find my mom.
A soldier saved her.
After several operations, she thought she had recovered completely, but yesterday she said: “Third months ago, pain came back.
I'm afraid I'll have to do another surgery.
I got a piece of scrap left in my lap.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people the way doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it," she said decisively.
“It just happened to me and it can’t change.
I'm going to the gym once a year to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we're trying not to talk to our friends about it.
This pain is too big.
My best friend and future partner of Jerry Gapoev's class were killed there.
As a child, we played together, and we imagined how we would go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten the capture, but the memories are a little pale every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we have received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my picture on the Internet, like I'm lying in a school window, I'm saying that a lot of people will see it first, understand the disaster and stop it from happening again.
A boy who ran away from the rain and believed his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia children start school in the seven years) and survived the school's class siege in the embrace of his mother Tamara.
At the time, a seven-year-old said, “Mother told me that if an explosion had occurred, I would have to lie down and hold her hand.”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
He was afraid that she was dead, ran away, and saw the pay boat, dropped the baby by the hand, and ran away with the bullet.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, "Damir told me his mother was dead."
He says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was on her way to freedom and was lying in a hospital with an injured leg and on the contrary thought that her son had died.
After they met again, she said: “I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and surrounded me.
Damir then fled to London (according to missing news news of the World), where then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie were declared winner Bernardo's Children.
"That threat is coming back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that memories are already pale.
I remember that right after I threw all my guns at the game.
But today I can play computer games where they shoot, and I don't have a problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I was playing with in the court and they didn't get out.
We'll never say they were killed or died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
For a trip to London, I remember well, especially how I could choose anything I wanted in the playground and how I was riding a convertible.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine, where he suffers as he and his friends suffer the war.
The threat comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I am very sorry for anyone who has to go through such a horror," says Damir, who took part in volunteer activities in the monastery last week.
I want a lot of help.
I want to work with the police once, and I hope they'll take me to the Academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember it quietly after the attack, and there were no children here who would scream and run, and it would last for months.
He lives on the road with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her reward for the award and the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember Damir's taste on the brush, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember you playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shot them with a water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And it was only a month since the threat.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think that the world has changed for the better over the past ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think it's gonna be and it's gonna kill a lot of kids.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for many people, war is just something in reports that they'll hear when they're bored or while they're doing something else.
I know what people are experiencing, what it's all about.
I still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and he's a nice and quiet kid, he's not even aggressive or stubborn.
For example, he doesn't apply for revenge, he doesn't even care.
I know she doesn't like to remember that, but she's very close to six associates and she's going to the gym from time to time and they're burning candles in there.
When he was younger, he had problems with that - I remember how he used to lie on his couch with his face turned away from us, and sometimes he used to lie down for hours.
He didn't sleep, he had open eyes.
I also remember that he threw out all his guns or other weapons to play. Damir is 17 today, is higher than I, pretty, smart and healthy.
It's hard to believe that I've been sure for several hours that he's dead and that I'll never see him again.
When I woke up after the explosion, I looked around and saw hell, there were pieces of human bodies lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my boyfriend didn't have a hell of a chance to survive.
“I remember shouting, “Damire, run, run!” but I was convinced that I did not hear.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our lives are different from others.
Grigory Ilyn, 17
A boy whose photograph was taken after the attack became a symbol of the threat in Beslan
Congratulations: Surviving from Beslan Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, Grigory right today
When he fled for life after a Czech terrorist shot his associates, he was terrified to his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the beast in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off on his first day at school and rushed to take his older son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists knocked on the door, so my boy stayed there alone for three days," she recalled.
Not entirely alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
He only survived my Grigory.
As the date approaches, it's still harder to think about and talk about it.
It won't even take a day to remember the tragedy.
It doesn't seem to us that it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are still coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: Photo Grigory (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated as a socha (right)
I remember when Grigory was so excited about school that he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
That he's alive, I found out when I saw him on TV.
In San Marino there's even the soch of Grigory paying.
Grigory's looking at the picture, and we have her hidden in the library at home.
I understand, but I also think that because of this picture, people around the world know how pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says: “It is important that this does not happen again.
“I doubt that we will ever learn the truth.
Similar tragedies are still being investigated, but no one will ever know the truth.
Now they're investigating the Boeing accident in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what was the cause?
This world is waiting for something very bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening, because when you ask people, they don’t want war, how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
To forget a little bit, it takes ten years.
It had an impact on my health, I still feel it.
Three or four years I had a nightmare attack, but then it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and associates who were killed.
That's why when it comes to September 1st, I'm going to the gym.
I want to honor childhood friends' memories.
It's hard for me to get into this gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is history.
I won't forget it, but I don't.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiosurgeon.
At first, I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't be healthy.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't work.
Grogory Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was kept at the foot of a murdering terrorist
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the foot of a killer terrorist during the attack, yet he managed to survive
When he was attacked in a full-flow, he was caught in a gym as he sits next to the bomb at the foot of a murdering terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It seems to us as if it were yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but because of the injury he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I put in my head.
Now I'm older and it's said that children with bad experiences can do better - I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I went to a psychologist and then I was a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - year later - it was the first and last thing I entered the gym again.
I'm gone.
I'll never go there again and please don't want me to show you where I'm sitting on that well-known image.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on the notebook with his photo posted in the hospital after the attack
This pain is huge, and I don't have it with me every day.
Friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me at school.
As for physical health, I'm fine.
I've got to be careful about my knee, which I've hurt, but I'm already walking normally.
But I couldn't get up and study at the FBS Academy in Petrohrad as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they told me it's not possible.
My other interest is animals, so I went to the vet.
I've been there for another year.
It teaches how to treat all animals from the "big after cow".
He said: “I know that I will never explain it to my children.
It's not something children should know about, and it's not something they should live on.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “This disease will still be here.
He's in there and he's getting worse with the coming year.
I'll take part in a memorial ceremony.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him, because he was different from me.
I waited for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregory's grown up today, but the threat's coming.
It's hard to accept when something so awfully unfair happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's undergone several operations, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say that's how 50% of the fear has been overcome, but to overcome it completely and not forget it.
This terrible experience will be with us all the time.
Many of our friends and neighbors were killed during the attack, and it only exacerbates the pain.
I lost a lot of people that I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could give me, but it hurts me to lose the dead.
I know families where other children were born, but also widows who have not remarried.
It's hard to assume that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I see what's going on in the world -- wars in other places.
What are people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we've been one of our friends, so how do we get into fighting together now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If we could take all those rebels and throw them away, as long as it goes.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
Child who took to safety special command
Saved: Alyon Tskaev takes to the Russian safe special command (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't even remember the tragedy.
In 2004, the world was pounded by a breath when little Alyon was taken out of the hand of a Russian police officer in Beslan.
The terrorists abandoned her, but in school gymnasts left her mother for 30 years, Kristina’s ten - year - old sister, and her brother, Makhar.
Makhar, who was then three years old, disappeared, but Alyon's mother and sister died during the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and had a little girl named Kristina after her daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, doesn't even remember the attack and grew out of it a smart and happy girl.
A close friend declared that “it is a great happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great children.”
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep the children away from the memories that the tenth anniversary recalls.
You can understand why.

4 tips how to order better photos and videos under water
If you are interested in drawing or filming under the water, you have a large selection of equipment available.
The cheapest option is a compact, for example Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoor camera type GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs about $300.
I ordered these photos for a family celebration of several photographs, all of which stood less than $350.
It doesn't matter what equipment you use, but several rules apply to achieving the best results.
Check your equipment.
Although you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the batteries and other parts are firmly closed.
Next set the camera according to what type of photos or videos you will edit.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or filming mode that optimizes exposure to the dark environment under water.
And before you get into it, find out how deep you can get with your equipment.
Some cameras are designed only to 5 feet, others up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide through the purchase and evaluation of digital cameras in regular and waterproof implementation.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them won't come out.
Compact cameras have LCD that will help you with the composition photos, but the outdoors don't have it.
Even if you have LCD, under the water, it'll be bad to see and the composition of the picture will be unpredictable.
So you always do more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of images with a slightly different resolution of the exposure, use it.
Stay close to the cold.
The deeper the light, the deeper the light dies.
If possible, stay in the swimming pool, lake or sea close to the cold.
This will also allow you to capture more light on the photos - the deeper you sink, the less color you see.
Get close to the photographed object.
It's a great advice if you take a picture of the drought, but under the water it's even more important because of the darker light.
It is especially important if you are filming with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a solid and wide angle of the point, which means that if you want to fill a camera, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality has been able to change things even in such a huge organization as NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to removing disease and treatment from the sick.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an officer of MI6, who had to live with the consequences of the torture that had frozen him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnosis and disease, the patients treated in the vast majority are interested in something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, it was the one who started to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt powerless.
He was confronted with the symptoms of the flu and found that he was impatient and his wife, Juliet, was involved in the riots.
He noted: "I want everything to be done sooner than later."
When Juliet went on a service trip for a week, Lawson was unusually upset.
Something was wrong.
His colleague made him an X-ray.
Once a couple of weeks ago, he was skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results came in.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that exacerbates the mucous membrane or if the lung is exposed.
In most cancers, it is difficult to determine what was their cause.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer have smoked.
But there's a different mezotel.
In almost every case, it is the cause of the exposure of asbestos - the construction of wet material, which was previously labeled "beautiful", but today it is known that it is deadly.
For most of us, it wasn't hard to ignore mesothelis.
asbestos, finally, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in Britain since the age of 60 when it entered into force the ban on the use of asbestos in industry.
Even at the time of the use of asbestos, only a few groups of people came into close contact with him, such as insulating treasurers, builders, treasurers and shipyard workers.
Toxin used in other industries today is hard to show as a cause for concern.
But this selfishness is not in place.
As it turns out, in Britain today, the mesothelioma epidemic is at the top.
The number of deaths on mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2 500 deaths per year are twice as many as the number of car accidents.
Number of deaths per year since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in Britain
The reason why we feel its effects right now, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos have finally been banned in 1999), is that it usually lasts for several decades before it develops.
The mesothelioma is not limited to the veterans of the construction industry.
asbestos was, and in many cases still, present in houses where we live, in offices where we work, in schools where we learn, and in shops where we buy.
So mesothelioma does not respect social order, wealth, reputation, or age.
The privileged gardens from London’s commercial houses after public schools do not represent a hideout.
Parliament is also full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which we should be treated are the warehouses of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even put in isolation.
He was trying to figure out where he could come in contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the underground steps of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
All students, sisters, doctors and returnees used walks.
The question is, how many of my colleagues get the same disease?
Sadly, that was a question he could answer in part.
"For four doctors who were in practice at Guy's Hospital who then showed up to mesothelioma in the past five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us are sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
Living with this diagnosis for so long is not common.
55% of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
Weakness is always mortal.
So now we can just repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us are sick with the same disease?"
According to a leading British expert on the mesothelimus of Professor Julian Peta, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain takes place, about 90,000 people die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die in this way.

When you look at the records from the archives of the courts to which the damage is often turned and require compensation, it shows how much mesothelimic decay has spread.
For example, this June, Marks & Spencer admitted that she had exposed the asbestos to Janice Allen out of concern.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she watched two sales in the clothing section - one of the places was a flagship company, a business on Oxford Street.
Allen's was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today she has two children who have more than 20 children.
"I tell you before it happened," he says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I've never even been dreaming that he might have something to do with me.
There are not many people who know anything about asbestos.
Actually, there's not one asbestos, but a group of six minerals.
The name was given by his fibrosic structure, which gives him strength and flexibility.
Three of the six minerals were used in construction.
The most common is found in buildings today, usually known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boilers and even brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, however, the EU and WHO consider it "a great health risk", which can cause death.
More dangerous, but it's brown asbestos and blue asbestos.
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts claim that “there is convincing, but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of an unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom].”
Employee Marsk & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the flag shop at Oxford Street in London
Janice Allen may not consider himself a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peta's work indicates that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients claims that “substantial part of cases of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was likely due to exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
A significant part of this exhibition is due to the "normal use and magnification" of buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure that he's safe.
The report Goddard Consulting, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the middle of the government do not have to realize that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report stating that the service elevators and pipes behind the parliamentary committee's premises are contaminated with asbestos, whose mortal fibers could be damaged by something as harmless as "a strong airflow."
Ministers are often accused of taking care only of their own interests, but in this case it can be the opposite of the truth.
Although Parliament's Directorate of Services has insisted that the Westminster Palace receive "good medical certificates", it is now calculated that it will take one million pounds and a few years of work to be carefully examined by Parliament, modernised and removed asbestos, and that after the elections in 2015 the MPs will sit in the areas of the Queen's Conference Centre in Westminster.
The Goddard report states that "the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several rules."
It's not possible to say that this mess will be a lifetime.
Everybody can just wait.
One of the people who have never been able to determine when asbestos was exposed to them is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) has suspected that asbestos was exposed to work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where the presence of asbestos was demonstrated," he says, "but in my case I can't prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked, and when he worked there.
Of course, he remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was hit by something like a cold.
He was 45, he was the night and he was just in the middle of the surgery.
I broke up all of a sudden.
It's a lie.
It was terrible.
I didn't think I'd drive home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain came from the chest, the joints around the lungs.
But just like Janice Allen, he had no reason to think it was a mess.
After all, he spent a month at home.
The confused doctors made him an X-ray and took him to the chest to remove the fluid from his lungs that he was sent to discuss.
Still, they didn't determine the diagnosis.
His condition improved slowly and he returned to work.
From time to time, though, his symptoms returned, often after he practiced and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to the operating room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Not even then, however, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and got into direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his doctor consulted his CT images and X-rays with the panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, he was in space between a chest tube and a lung tube introduced by a probe equipped with a camera.
I'm optimistic.
I tend to take nothing too much," he says.
To be honest, I didn't care much about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy came between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it's a mess."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott started meeting with the Macmillan charity nurses and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At this point, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos has been used extensively, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos heat insulation in the pipes," he says.
People who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now getting sick.
So mesothelioma is now beginning to affect younger people who do not have a risk warrant.
The most dangerous tubes of heat-insulated asbestos were found in hospitals in the basement, so it was unlikely that patients would be in danger.
However, staff who walked underground between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining room (such as Graham Abbottt) certainly came in contact with the toxic substance.
As is now evident, several decades after the war, the hospital was a place where patients could save their lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of doctors who treated them.
asbestos is being removed to this day.
The students of Bunsen's kahan built on the asbestos floor
And it's not just a hospital.
asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and consultants because of its excellent insulation and non-burning properties.
At school, too.
In fact, many people have already been exposed to asbestos at school.
In countless hours of chemistry, students built Bunsen's kahan on the asbestos floor.
The website was raised on the issue of asbestos in schools.
Unfortunate things like floor tiles or roofs on tools in our homes usually contained asbestos.
"It is an industrial poison built into a large number of houses," noted Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his appeal against Guy's Hospital.
In one case there was a single contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma could remember in the 1970 ’ s when she was fighting a garden home.
So be careful how you beat the garden house.
Knowing that disease is incurable, the impact of diagnosis is enormous.
"It takes a while for you," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found out I can't focus on what I'm doing.
I've been in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized I was gonna have to leave and work on my own.
Well, I can't get another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the shift from the doctor's position to the patient's position.
As an innumerable number of patients before him, he remembers how he felt confused about the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I have?"
I was told 12 months ago.
I remember saying, “Well, I don’t have another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelim is especially destructive, because the very mechanism that keeps us alive -- the breathing itself -- is what causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Azbeth is made of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is broken and fibers are inhaled, they can be placed in the womb, the lungs showcase.
The asbestos fibers of the vortex and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is the inspired asbestos fiber in the shape of a needle," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiosurgeon who entered the Guy's Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, which is a paradoxical center for mesothelioma treatment.
Treasure Lawson also knows and treats other patients who were exposed to asbestos during the practice in the hospital.
The asbestos’s wheels reach into the lung tissue, says Treasure, and “stolen breathing is pushing around where the exhibitor is located.
They've been invasive since the beginning.
The usual treatment options used in other types of cancer do not cover so much on mesothelioma.
For example, the fire is discussed on the effectiveness of the operation.
According to some, she'd be tempted.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the scar," he says.
You won't get around her scalpel.
Cancer "is not too responsive to chemotherapy", which has "some effect", but does not cure.
“Sometimes someone who survives lung cancer occurs,” says Treasure.
But in the end, everyone dies.
Fortunately, some patients live a long time longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years since his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After finding mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and advice for the same affected people.
When they called, he joyfully introduced himself: “Good day, you called at the cancer center.”
"It was very positive," said Abbott.
His disability was diagnosed four years ago and he was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last four months, and probably only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give it up.
Lawson, however, "was able to show things in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the chest surgery department at the Guy's Hospital hospital.
"I had the advantage that I didn't have to wait until I was sent to him, but I just called there and they looked at me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get an application, and they would have to approve his compensation.
For patients with mesothelioma, the key issue is to get the best treatment available.
But when different treatments are ultimately inevitable, many patients face another financial care - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they're turning to the courts and they want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan with Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health," says Morgan.
In the 1960 ’ s, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And this is where we meet a homeless company.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled, but according to Morgan, it wasn't a "full balance", because Lawson couldn't definitely prove that the mesothelis were the result of the exposure of asbestos to Guy's Hospital.
After the case was investigated, however, the speaker Guy's Hospital confirmed that "the asbestos in the incriminated subterranean part was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
The exposure of mortal asbestos to one company or place of work - usually decades after this happened - has proved to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma who seek compensation.
A lot of former jobs have changed the owner or ruined it.
Evidence's lost.
And those who are now accused of defending themselves have time on their side, and certainly their plaintiffs do not.
In response to this fact, this year an important new legislation has been approved, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek redress, even if it is not possible to search for their former employer.
The law created a 350 million financial reserve, which builds insurance and is designed for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they were exposed to asbestos, but have no one to complain about.
In such a case, 80 % of the amount that the court would normally charge them as compensation - about 120,000 pounds.
Every year 300 successful applications are expected.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with mesothelioma, believes that 350 million pounds is "good work".
"It is an agreement signed by insurance companies," he says and points out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if time and people with mesothelioma had not been able to supply ex-employers and normally complain about them.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law "had gaps."
But Penning and Morgan admit that, in view of the seven deaths each year, a quick deal was needed.
"People suffer too much and need help immediately," Penning said last December during the second reading of the law on mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, he recommended the Lang-Lazdun operation, which, unlike Tom Treasury, thought had a positive effect.
After surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy were followed - a threefold treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski can lead to a survival rate of up to 40% of patients.
Abbotta made it stronger.
"Of course that's not the most important thing," said Abbott.
You still see it in patients.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott joined the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last six cycles of chemotherapy.
Control checks showed no signs of disease.
I went to another check in March [2014].
In my chest, I had a couple of broken ribs.
My 50th birthday was just getting closer.
It's not a life threat.
Take it.
Abbott re-entered six cycles of chemotherapy.
There are currently no traces of tumor in his body.
But it's a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - about financial security when I die, or about showing a woman how the boiler wakes up.
When you get the bad news, you start being negative.
You have to look forward.
As for Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14) it is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition means I'll never be old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin is very social and savage.
She told her friends, and suddenly we started calling a lot of people.
Ellie was more persistent.
She didn't say much.
All patients with cancer must face such interviews.
However, in patients with mesothelioma, such conversations are not delayed by hope or by signs of survival.
Miserableness brings with it (and finally brought to Stephen Jay Gould) unsatisfying certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "life is not at risk for mesotheliers."
The bodies of the embellished Pharaohs are packed into the asbestos plate.
The asbestos fibers are used to strengthen the resins for cooking and increase resistance to fire.
It's the old one's description of asbestos.
There was a tissue found that was non-smoker.
I've seen some of the pieces made of it that were stuck in the skulls in the guesthouses.
In Italy asbestos is starting to appear in commercial use, used for the production of paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos valleys open in Canada and South Africa, soon thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
During the industrial revolution, it is an excellent insulation substance in steam engines and turbines.
The world's production of asbestos increases to over 30,000 tons a year.
Prudential insurance statistics find higher mortality among people working with asbestos and are then denied life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw is dying in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke confirms that the asbestos particles in her lungs "were undoubtedly the cause of her death."
This is the first case of this kind.
Employees of Kershaw, Turner Bros Asbestos, refuse responsibility.
He won't pay any compensation.
During the 2nd world war, ships are built intensively, the work in the ships represents the highest risk of exposure to asbestos.
Prohibition of imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful action for damage to health resulting from the exposure of asbestos in Britain.
The world's production of asbestos increases to more than 4,213,000 tons annually.
The United Kingdom imports 139 000 tonnes.
The British Institute for Health and Safety requires all suppliers of asbestos to be licensed.
Imports and use of blue and brown asbestos are prohibited by law in Britain.
In Britain, the use of all kinds of asbestos is prohibited.
The law on mesothelioma shall enter into force in the United Kingdom.
The 350 million compensation program has been launched.
asbestos is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world, white asbestos continues to be used as cheap construction material.
World production is held on two million tons a year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong authority to choose leadership - demonstrators promise revenge
In spite of the numerous discussions on democratic reform on Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections.
This step is likely to result in a long promised protest in the Hong Kong business district, as activists began to organize and catch only a few hours after this announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress basically allows the Communist Leaders to dispose of any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"It may not surprise us, but it upset us," said Lawyer Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it's clear that we have something to do with the authoritarian regime.
In defence of the Chinese decision, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of Li Fei said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong elections would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when Britain returned to Hong Kong's administration, Beijing has promised that as early as 2017, the population will be able to choose the executive power.
The Chinese leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong allows direct voting, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leaders hold firmly to the nomination process of the Committee, which is closely controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which marked one of the biggest and most followed-up protests in Hong Kong for several years.
Most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are based on the occupation of the Centre with love and peace, whose organizers threatened to close the financial quarter unless Beijing gives them general voting rights.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the movement of the occupation gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government.
At the demonstration, the organizers announced that their movement is entering the new phase of civil disobedience and that the wave of protests will begin in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, obviously they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said that the movement “considered the occupation of the Central only as the last step in the event that all options for dialogue were exhausted and no other choice would arise.
We must announce with the policing that today all the options for dialogue have been exhausted and the storage of the Centre is inevitable.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing themselves for Beijing's announcement all day, and on Sunday they have strengthened the protection of the government's headquarters and have deployed police and barricades.
Many Hong Kong residents believe that the city is slowly losing control of the city.
The history of people from the fortress increases competition in the field of products and services.
They also fear that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are increasing by pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticise the U.S.O. movement and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - the Hong Kong rescue ship.
"The protest that they are talking about could cause much greater economic damage, depending on how many people are involved and for how long," says political Regina Ip, who is criticizing the long-term movement.
We don't want the worries of Hong Kong getting out of control.
Such an attitude could damage investment.
The Chinese state media has also reported in recent days that democratic activists in Hong Kong are acting as subversive Western-controlled agents.
During the summer, activists organised an informal referendum on voting rights, with 780,000 participants -- more than five volunteers in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people attended one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the area.
Pre-election agitka?
The League in Jihlava bears the name according to the political movement
A small burial is played by approximately 1,600 amateur athletes in the town of Vysočina.
And their highest competition is again called the Battle of Jihlava.
The name was given according to one motion that goes to the October municipal elections.
In addition, a tenth of his candidate is the boss of a small dug-in in Jihlava, Jan Mrák.
"There was a vain gathering where there was no problem with it," said the Dark.
The situation around the first league of small dignitaries has already been addressed by the lawmakers of the Yugoslav Council and recommended changing the system of distribution of grants.
A small tomb won by the city's website about a million crowns last year.
And this year it's about the amount in hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure is not small grounded in breach of the law or the guidelines of the magistrate.
The situation is, however, an incentive for the Office to amend the rules for granting grants and grants," Radek Tulis spokesperson.
Drop the grants from the city and at the same time say that as a small-scale support in the elections of one political party, it will probably not go away.
A similar demand from politicians for a high-level "great" football has not yet come.
That ČSSD should result in a country transfer, ODS division or KDU-CSL 1.
What about class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be for that.
On the contrary, I would be pleased if sponsors from a number of companies were to turn to us," noted the president of the Regional Football Association Miroslav Vrzáček.
Head of the small football on the other side and move to the name of the league won't let
According to players, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own area with six playgrounds, tents and social facilities.
"For example, the game on the stairs isn't ours, we're there for rent," said Ondřej Lapeš from Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable locality would be the Czech mill.
But there will be built, for example, in my opinion, a foolish area for skates, which are about fifty in Jihlava," warned the Dark.
The Prime Minister of Jihlava Jaroslav Výmazal (ODS) reacted that a small plot uses a field with artificial grass in the streets of Roshische and On Stoopás, which are in the property of the city.
We want to build a playground that has maximum use.
We are going to modernise or build sports facilities at schools that will be available in the afternoon hours.
I think that in recent years, for a small burial, huge progress has been made," Vymazal added.
The other political parties in the names of the leagues do not appear according to Jan.
We have limitations.
If someone in one of the sectors joins us, then we don't do the other," he explained.
"Political movements in the name of the league, I consider this to be at least an unfortunate step," said a member of the Advisory Committee on Sport Karel Voldán.
"But let the voters assess whether Mr. Mráka is using a small mining company of Jihlava and supporting cities for political purposes, or not," he added.
U.S. tradition penetrates the university life - the champions can fly by plane
We are pleased that we can respond to the request by launching the first luxury travel service for students in Britain.
In order to leave the best impression on the University's arrival, the company also offers the possibility of transporting a private three-wheeler or a Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also stated that the service has its own security page.
Service is the ideal option for students who otherwise have to drag their things across the entire state in a dangerous car loaded.
We are pleased that with our VIF (very important hairdresser - very important element) variants this year, we will ensure that students will arrive at the university with minimum nervousness and maximum luxury.
Speaking companies said that since the services had just dropped off, they had no reservations yet, but added: “Students will start making reservations over the next few weeks.”
The company also stated that although students pay their annual school fees of 9,000 pounds, they expect that the service on the market will find its place.
Compared to students ten years ago, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today's students are different in terms of expectations and desires - it's more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF program is exactly the right way to achieve it.
The National Union of Students, however, criticised the service as inconvenient.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: “For most students, such a project is inconvenient.
Many students who are attending this month's university must be able to cope with the financial crisis before spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as getting on the track, because the financial support available in the form of loans and grants is not able to take a step towards rising costs of basic needs.
Feminists face racism and police behaviour after the Ferguson events
At the beginning of the month, a police officer in Ferguson killed an unarmed young man in Missouri.
Those present who are waiting for a funeral with their hands up and say, "Don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson in Missouri for the murder of unarmed young Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peréz recorded the movement in online discussions of white feminists.
She found that in promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer sex before race.
With increasing tensions in the Middle West, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perez noted that the protein reaction is 100 % focused on race.
Compared to the reactions of blacks soon after the 9th of August, personal articles with headlines such as “the idea of whites on Ferguson” or “Feminism is not only about women’s suppression” appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, however, this is an important change.
"I don't think there's a lot of people in feminist movement who would talk about race and opinion at such a level," she said.
People felt that what happened had to be expressed.
For the crisis we are facing, it is characteristic, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially protected that they have to warn.
According to English professors at the State University of Ohio, the Mitchells at Ohio brought Ferguson to light the problems that African Americans have to face every day and that in the cultural sphere are not perceived as "women's issues".
"I can publish funny stories on Facebook with my partner and get 150 characters from people from all over the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about coloring in my own country in captivity, it's a quiet distasteful.
"How is it possible that a woman can talk publicly about relations, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For blacks like Mitchell, who have dealt with the question of race, sex and sexuality in American history, there are no issues of race and sex dichotomy.
According to her, blacks could not afford luxury to share these problems: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although the whites today question race and sex in mainstream feminist circles coincide, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's issues and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black people were lynched and the reason was in almost all cases of white violence," Hattery said.
For reasons of lynching, you needed to cooperate with the whites.
According to Hattery's distinction between whites and blacks came when the voters for election rights such as Susan B. Anthony studied at the end of the 19th century field and realized that election rights can have only one group of people - women or blacks.
"They decided to place their cards on women's voting rights and to focus on black people's rights later," Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we get an important view of why colorful women don't believe in whites.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black people protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained election rights in 1920, it took ten years to organize anti-lying in the Southern Women's Association for Prevention of Lying.
The group emerged 40 years after the blacks first said they were helping.
According to Mitchell's response to the questions that took place in Ferguson - the question of police behaviour, racial discrimination - it reflects the time when white feminists had to "succeed" the questions that black people faced for generations.
"It wouldn't be great if activists in these areas [traditional feminism] had the right to raise a child just as seriously as they had the right to an anti-conception?" Mitchell said.
The second wave of feminists, who have made a career in combating reproductive rights and access to contraception, now find out what that means.
Significant feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown's attack on Facebook, where they published Rebecca Carroll's column from the Guardian, which required white Americans to protest more firmly against racism.
"I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding danger in society - and opinions on race that differ significantly in public opinion - will try to change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for cross-sectional feminism, which includes issues of race and sex, her comments on race in America are made by some people.
An expert at the American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, author of the book "Who stole feminism?", told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young color men, are "more vulnerable than their sisters", but the comments of the Steinem Party of Ferguson face criticism that she had already triggered.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small My Brother's Keeper program, which had the help of vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it caused many feminists including Gloria Steinem's angry reaction.
The relationship of police to the Black Community is not the only problem that comes in advance of the interest of mainstream feminism.
After the US Border Police held nearly 63 000 young people in the South-west this year without accompanying them, the question of immigration laws reform arose again - this time as a female question.
Andrea Mercadová, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women to reform immigration laws, said that the only thing she had to do was share immigration stories.
"He speaks for himself," says Mercado.
In view of the fact that most work permits are granted to men, women who come with them feel vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have an announcement in women's organisations," she said.
Pets' residence in Ipswichi for sale
The real office removed the image of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, it was rested on it in a pig's living room.
A single-room house, which is for sale for 120,000 pounds, stands on a private road in Ipswichi.
Information photographs included a picture of the living room in which he rests with his head on the pig’s couch.
The real office of Connells stated that the pig on the photo is a pet pet of owners.
"The photo felt wrong there, and that's why it was already removed," the speaker's office said.
In the real estate information, Connells described the former prayer as "the only single single-room house."
Although the photo office has already removed from its website, promotional materials still appear.
The sale of the house caused interest on social networks where some asked whether the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, Harvey has a city in the southwestern part of the world.
A lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
He's looking for a new millionaire in the South-East of Perth, a lucky guy from Saturday's lottery to drive $1.1 million home.
Traffic in Harvey has been in the process of dividing happiness for over five years, and last November 2009 has been a win of one million dollars.
A glorious winner, however, must first sign up.
Trade owner Steve Forward said he was talking about winning the whole city in South-West Perth.
It's the main theme, and everyone's upset.
We thought a similar victory was a touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia split one win last month, ending several happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August and only a few weeks ago in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning twins sat down for 20 years and said that winning would allow them to process the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th only lottery winner in Western Australia this year, totaling $85 million.
The trains of Deutsche Bahn won't leave tonight.
Engineers want higher wages
The GDL in the press release marked a protest for a warning station for which it was approved to select time outside the transport point.
At the selected time, the GDL takes into account many people who return from the weekend after the railway to the first working day.
At the same time, we also think about people who are going to work during the day," the board said on Monday morning in a press release to declare the statement.
"Our first stage should affect, above all, freight transport, less passengers," added the GDL.
DB has not yet published an official response to the statement.
It is not even clear how protests will affect international railway connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The committees require a five per cent increase in the workforce and a two-hour reduction in working hours per week.
Currently, the average wage of machine owners varies depending on the years worked between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) per year.
DB engineers work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to join the growth of wages when the working time is reduced.
They stress, however, that the wage rating of drivers must be developed in the same way as for other railway personnel with whom DB is not counted as a minimum working week.
She threatened to burn Krest's car.
That's why Barum's rally is over.
What exactly happened?
It's about material fraud.
The car was completely new, so I didn't even think something like that could happen.
Could not the exhaust temporarily fix and continue at a slower pace to the service where the mechanics would exchange it?
If we were to go straight there, yes.
But we were still waiting for two more essays, and that didn't work.
There's a high temperature in it, and the risk that the car would start burning was big.
I can't afford that.
You've completed five speed tests.
What do you think of them?
Very good.
I felt like a cold.
We were fast, but I didn't go through the wine.
Everything was caused by we hit the car for more than half a year to be at some level.
The race proved to be a success.
You blew him up so you could really think about winning.
I made myself a car so that we really had a win.
The work didn't come out of nowhere.
On the other hand, the result that we could think of did not come to light.
But it's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one of the peaks that got out of the first battle.
They've come out of him as well as Breen, Abbring or Lappi's foreign favorites.
You're surprised so many favorites have gone away?
Yes.
It was a pity, especially for the spectators, because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, the one you're going to drive, was moving at the peak for a long time.
He just paid for getting out of the street and taking almost two minutes of lack.
How were you satisfied with his performance?
It's a shame because he could repeat the winnings.
He's been driving the first time.
But Mira also confirmed that we had found the car well.
He's very fast.
Just a year ago, you announced the end of your career, although you showed up at the start of Barum rally.
Could it be good for you to make a regular part of the rally races again?
I'm sure not right now.
Last year I said Barumka was my last race and I didn't get it.
I decided I'd take her again.
It was my present 90th start, and when there's a chance again in a year, I'll probably go.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people have come to waste just because of you.
Did you enjoy it?
To some extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's up with you guys, Barumce?
The team's continuing.
Next week, we'll go to Vyskov, where Robert Adolf will run.
I hope the car didn't hurt much here.
In addition, he wants to borrow the Fabby of Honza Sykor from us for this race.
Mira and I are waiting for a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We're gonna have to catch things for next year.
Can you point something out?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsica rally was part of the world's championship, the fifth place you reached your maximum in the series.
Doesn't it make you try that trail again?
Don't laugh.
The oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not let yourself be exposed to a doctor's confirmation of inability to work, which serves as evidence for the organisation that you cannot perform your duties for health reasons.
Moreover, you did not immediately inform the employer of your absence.
As a result, it was agreed that these days would be shown as a vacation, but the agreement only went orally.
Although the employer does not have the obligation to have a written confirmation of the employer's consent to the allowance, this procedure has been certified in practice.
If there's only an oral agreement, you don't have a confirmation agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to the discharge may be granted, as in your case, denied and inadmissibility in the work may be considered as a long-term unannounced absence, therefore the reason for the immediate abolition of the working conditions under § 53 of the Act of Employment.
In the case of a court dispute concerning an agreement with your employer, there is no evidence of such a lack of evidence.
The working relationship with you has not been deleted according to § 53, you have only the days specified in the statement sheet as an unannounced absence.
The undeclared absence in the budget sheet does not have the same effect as § 53 (e.g. the possibility of obtaining substantial unemployment insurance), yet it is difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and let yourself be confirmed in writing that there has actually been a loss, as a result of which you have been unable to work (sometimes called "insomnia", it is just a doctor's report).
If you are looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the presentation of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work, the rapid notification of the employer or the request for written consent with the allowance allowed.
You're avoiding any complications like that.
Tony Stewart's accident back on track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just a bit behind half the Atlanta Motor Speedway racetrack.
Stewart suddenly hit the fence after he broke his right front tire in the 172nd round, and the race for him ended.
Stewart took a ruined car to the garage, didn't speak to reporters and left.
The boss of his team Chad Johnston said the car number 14 was disappointed, but he will now focus on a race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I would like us to have better performance and a better conclusion," said Johnston.
We're gonna go to Richmond and we're gonna hope that we're gonna get more out there.
Stewart went to the building first in the Sunday evening competition after the carriage with Kyle Bush, which he requested to repair his car.
"To this day we have put hope in a good marriage," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a New York race, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to get the place in the table.
He returned to the race during the investigation of a tragic accident in which a 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. died, who took Stewart to the race.
The authorities said that the investigation of the cause of the accident would take at least two weeks.
So far, it hasn't been decided whether Stewart would face any charges.
The three-man champion reached a hot boost before the race.
Stewart started at the 12th place, worked at the 10th and then even at the 4th.
Then, at the beginning of 122nd wheel, Busch's car no.
18 got out of control, got out of the second bay, and came to Stewart, and sent both of them to the building.
Stewart went on, but he got to 21st place.
Prague has chosen a new taxi store manager, earning 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection procedure for the new taxi manager.
In 103 parking stations, there are about 12.3 million crowns per year.
Today, for the same seats for the cab drivers, 150 thousand crowns have been selected annually.
He briefed the Council of Lukas Manhattan (TOP 09).
The city used to be used for the selection of administrators.
The winner then got a rent for a small amount of 1,000 crowns a year.
But the rules have changed.
At present, he is deciding on the number of bids.
"The year since the opening of the original rental contracts and the opening of the selection procedure has shown that the new rental system is far more beneficial and generally fairer for Prague," the council said.
The most expensive fleck is in Perštín
The highest price was offered by interested parties on the street in Perštín.
He'll pay $2.1 million a year.
About 1.5 million new crowns were paid by the new administrators for seats in front of the General House or in Václav Square.
The new rules for rental of taxis services were adopted by the Council in autumn 2012 and the original rental contracts were announced last year.
The selection process was conducted in four waves and a new manager found 29 posts.
We had to clean the fridge for the second time this year.
Every time we let her out, we made a practically second fisherman around the cabin.
Then we found Sava.
Incredible smell!
Our barn in the store always had plenty of beautiful drinking water.
And it wasn't someone's professionally made, Grandpa gave her help.
Long time ago.
She was only on three laps and she was totally sloppy, like everything else in the cabin, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until the summer.
When we started the season, of course we drained the water.
When she got there a number of months, she deserved it.
But then it seemed to us that the water wasn't working.
We were wondering if there was something wrong.
In the place where the pump was going through, it was possible in a bit of the woods, the board was not quite there, so the opening was sealed with a piece of silence.
Our inspection confirmed that it was still moving.
Otherwise there was nothing to see in the water, and we lighted it to the bottom.
So we let her out again and cleaned her up.
Of course, we improved the improvised tightness around the pump tube.
We noticed strange things in the store.
On the ground, there was a glued package with some bones.
At least it looked like it.
And then another piece.
Now it looked like an oscillated mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where the streams, Grandpa's inventions, there were the rest of the fish!
And it's hard to go!
Our store's cool, too.
Someone would have said that Grandpa's been burying the chat for a while.
And he wouldn't be so far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are just a breath of sand, only the ceiling is covered.
They're putting ships in there.
And the car.
And a beach bed.
The door with wide spaces was mostly open as someone walked there in one piece.
At the ceiling of several of the already mentioned streams.
No network, so there's usually a bird flying there, and a nest is built on the plots.
It's unnecessary to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to be fought, and that's it again.
Now, of course, the air didn't help.
The whole store smelled.
So we cleaned up the whole store.
Especially the fish on the tray was nutritious!
We also threw out things that were around: the wood, the heraclytic board, and so on.
Our chat on the far side welcomed by a collapsing disinfectant.
We've been thinking about who could get us those disgusting remains?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here all over the place.
It's hard for her to go to bed with us.
Grandpa attacked a neighbor who's not quite okay.
If he didn't take the French shit out of us in there, did he?
He's been around for almost a year, stupid ideas, he's got it.
We decided to watch the store and check the fridge regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so long as we only wash and wash before the tests are finished, but it's been good.
Pulling water from the forest studio is nothing I'd like to do for a long time.
We once heard a terrible nightmare of our pheasant.
Mom looked from the balcony and saw in the grass next to Veranda a long, strong black hat.
The line jumped over her, and she screamed like a fool.
Her mom was out because she thought Réza was digging a garbage dump out of the washroom.
Suddenly, however, the hady got partially stuck in the club and partially straightened out.
There's been a blackout on the balcony.
The line got a hysterical grip.
We ran down.
She was about to take a huge oil and cut her head off. She was about to take a lot of it over a meter and a fat bull.
It was not clear whether she wanted to save the oil or whether she wanted to eat it alone, but it was irrelevant.
When the nuns saw the transmission in the shape of our entire family, she probably said that we would eat it when we were so hungry, and she walked along the road to the store.
We were flying for her.
It's a lot of blizzard jumping for the cold.
Just like that, we've recorded on her desk another smelling package.
It's like a fish.
She wasn't there last night!
Our new security around the pump was a bit of a boss.
And that's what we shut down the store in the daytime.
That he would...
We got out, and we all ran into one stream.
We haven't waited a long time.
It's embarrassing for the cold.
First, a flat head appeared with yellow moons on its neck.
Then the whole lock went off on the fridge.
She circled around the pump and started getting inside.
The fired employee took revenge, bought a notebook and sold it to the company.
The buried employee bought it on the computer company after the release and then sold it.
The money you received came to be lost before the police were arrested.
During a short time, a man bought in 12 cases a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"After taking the notes, he drove to Olomouce, where he sold them after the bazaars," said the top commissioner of the Smurf police Rostislav Brückner.
For reasons of fraud, the employer was responsible for the release and also for the profit of the money.
"When he questioned us, he claimed that he used the money for loan payments," Brinkner said.
The police also found that a cheater is a pathological player who has repeatedly been treated for psychiatric purposes.
Money could also end in winning devices or in video lottery terminals.
"The fact is we didn't find any money at his place," said the Commissioner.
A traitor who has been punished for stealing has now threatened to remain in prison for up to five years.
The police haven't told us yet whether the penalty is also a threat to the bankers who bought the notebooks at the price and then sold them.
"It is true that they have completely taken over the new goods, which is at least suspicious," the Commissioner said.
However, none of the owners of the pool have ever been accused.
Come on, another bit, you can handle it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague.
This year, our directors have made a number of changes.
The biggest was the change in the route, which led to the goal of the navigable, instead of leading back to the Yellow Ladders.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to spend it a little bit on the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally heal our readers at the station, where we took pictures together and filmed the videos.
In order to get my perspective on the other side to perfection, I took the role of a personal guide.
Together with a friend of Kātā, we arranged for the end of the corridor between 60 and 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted our friends who were passing us to the faster-run sector.
There's not much time left.
A few jumps on the heat, turn on sports tests, countdown and start!
The screams of jasote, but instead of a quick start followed the bathing to the start line.
After five minutes, we come to the gate, we turn the measurement off, and we run at ten o'clock.
We're going through a yellow hat of runners who, like Cat, run their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, slowly lowering the sun on the sky gives a view of Vyšehrad almost to the hummingbird.
The pulsating meat coming along the coast looks like the whole Prague is running here.
On the coast between the Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally shown who has the strength.
A light pickup at the Palaque Square forces many runners to slow down or move on.
Just before I go to the divadelní I see a police escort and immediately follow him, Vítek Pavlista is at an incredible pace to the goal.
I'm hearing the strange, inflamed respiration of other runners.
I'm moving to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he's going to cry with me, but right before that, he's stabbing my leg, and our hands are just passing.
The street of the Theatre offers a chance for a short rest and relaxation.
There's a need, in front of us, for places where I can see my breath.
The island on the Manes Bridge shows Prague in the beauty of the falling sun.
I'm not breathing and my legs are almost alone.
For the first time in the ministry, there's a moment of truth.
At the crossing of the road, the Cat is crawling about the rudder and takes a leap of the sail.
I see if she doesn't need help, and I'm dropping a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
We wake up and continue the Kozí street, it's one of the narrowest places of the track, at this stage of the race, although there's no such slope, yet there's a need to watch around.
I still don't know that the concept of a narrow place gets its true meaning later.
At the Prague gate, we are warmly encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I'm trying to lash out with anyone who can offer a hand, and I'm recommending it to Kata, because ten lash out with fans is like half an energy stick.
It's actually working, we're running fast again, and if we've lost a lot of time, now we're getting on the road.
We're running out of dozens of runners, when I have someone especially tired, I'm trying to encourage him with a few words, "Come on, just a little more, you can do it!"
No one's ahead of us for the last little girl, we're speeding up.
So far we've been running for an hour and a quarter, adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the target will hurt, but you really need to make it.
The sun has fallen slowly, and the final day is symbolically slow to finish the race.
The last race to the bridge, the bay, and the only way to reach the target.
The pace we're running, I'm surprised where the girl takes it?
"Come on, let's go under thirteen hours, let's go!" I call.
We're trying, we're sprinting, and there's a target here.
An hour of thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
Coach set a limit of 20 hours.
So seven minutes under plan.
Which is a great result.
Right behind the goal of Kata's legs, I'm helping her to get her to rest for a while.
She's got to see the exhausting, but also good luck with a good performance.
After a while, I'll take her out of the target space.
Euphoria doesn't make us think of the pressure in the passageway.
Here's to see that the Koz street wasn't the narrowest place.
That's why it's here for the purpose of the landing, which is under the strain of nearly ten thousand runners attached to the crash.
If anyone doesn't like gifts, it's not a place for him.
And after a while, I lose my head and think about whether the beautiful views and contrasts of the past years have become more interesting than what's going on in the target.
From my own experience, I know that running a race is no fun.
If ten thousand people are added to this, the rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire Prague Centre for All Transport, this is a huge challenge.
This year’s change of route showed the runners many interesting places, but it also brought a number of really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere released in Yellow Baths was transferred between the race and the race itself.
The organizers around the track and the random spectators graded it on every meter of track.
Unfortunately, in the course of the city's historic centre, it has to be counted with obstacles that cannot be removed, but the goal of the mass race in a place that is on one side confined to the wall and on the other, I do not consider it the best solution.
If I say that the race has ended with a running goal, I will evaluate it as a very successful one.
I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but finally everything went well.
Write to us in the discussion if you like the route and what you say about the situation in the target.
Prisoners in Bulgaria organise protests
Hundreds of prison staff throughout Bulgaria attended the international protest meeting before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their requirement to re-establish the original working conditions, which had recently changed.
The list of requirements to be discussed with the temporary Minister of Justice of Christ Ivanov is also higher.
The overseers of the month symbolically protested against the new working time and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the committees of the prison supervisors and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, they informed the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR).
"The negotiations are still taking place," said BNR Director General of the Rosen Zhelyazkov Prison Service.
The members of the Federation of Trade Associations of Employees in the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protests of staff members of the prison service.
Why can the universe have more dimensions and we don't see them
The physics usually doesn't write bestsellers, but Brian Green from the University of Colombia made a hit in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe became the most accessible route for times to penetrate into the host of problems that many theoretical physicists deal with today - trying to unite two great functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the elegant universe is that in the search for a unified physical theory, there is no boring story.
The basic physical problem between two key theories (because at this point our universe is de facto divided into two different worlds with different laws) has been solved and solved so with an idea that it is worth retelling and time.
Greene also advised with the complex material so much fresh and yet that he could not count how interesting he had not included in his book.
In addition, he corrected his "error" from most of it in two other books: Structure of the universe and Hidden Reality.
Obviously, the author would not object to anything if his book was getting older faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the elegant universe still provides almost everything that the informed time with an ambitious understanding of the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is relatively likely that in the next few years, there will be nothing more alive in this area (which is because the LHC accelerator will eventually go to "full gas") and it is good to enter the Green unviolently open doors of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions can certainly sound ridiculous, fantastic, strange, or mystic.
Yet it is concrete and entirely acceptable.
To understand it, let us for a moment turn our vision from the universe as a whole to something more subtle, specifically to a long and thin gardening alley.
Imagine that you pull a hundred meters of garden tiles from one side of the canyon to the other and follow the entire scenario from a half-kilometre distance (as on the picture and on the following page).
From such a distance you can easily notice the length in the horizontal direction of the hose, but if you just don't suffer from the bristro-brightness, you will find the thickness of the hose difficult.
In view of your great distance from the hadis, you would think that the ant forced to live on the hadis has only one dimension in which you can walk: the left-right dimension along the hadis.
If someone asks you where the ant was at the moment, you will answer only one question: the distance of an ant from the left (or right) end of the ant.
All we want to say is that from a distance of half a kilometer, the long piece of hadice looks like a uniform object.
In the real world, there's a shark in it.
If we increase everything, we will suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle surrounding the hippies.
In this increased view, it is obvious that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in a well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hadis, but also in "the dimension in/in the direction of movement of the clock handles", i.e. around the circumference of the hadice.
You start to understand that to determine the position of a small ant, you have to enter two numbers: how far from the end of the hadis and where it is on the circle surrounding the hadis.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hadice is double-dimensional (known experts will find that this chapter focuses purely on the disorder theory of strings.
Chapters 12 and 13 shall examine the non-performing aspects).
The surface of the hadice is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, a dimension in the direction of the circle, marked by a circular arrow, is short and sintered.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The size of the side of the hose is long and easily visible.
The size of the surrounding area of the hadice is short, "swine" and worse known.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the sharks with a much better distinction.
This example illustrates the important quality of the spatial dimensions.
That they split into two groups.
They can be large, wide, and therefore visible, or rather small, porous and much more noticeable.
Of course, in that case, we did not prejudge ourselves to reveal the "swine" dimension of the rolling mass of the shark.
It was enough to take a long view of help.
But if the hats were thinner - like the hair or the capillary - we'd only be able to reveal the pig's size with great effort.
Kaluza sent his article to Einstein in 1919, in which he gave a thrilling thought that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three known dimensions for all of us.
Kaluza's radical claim was justified by the fact that an additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be vetted into a single, unified concept structure.
The immediate question is how this Kaluz look goes together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer that Kaluza quietly predicted between the lines and which he made clear and clarified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926 stands and falls on the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and porous dimensions.
This means that, like the dimension in the length of the hadice, our universe has a large, wide and easily visible three dimensions, the existence of which we realize at every moment.
But analogically with the circular area of the garden has the space and additional dimensions, firmly ground into the space so impermeable that even in front of our most perfect experimental devices, there have remained hidden.
To get a clearer idea of the basis of Kaluz's remarkable proposal, let's stay at the hemisphere for a while.
Imagine that we're drawing a black, rather dense series of circles on the hedge circle.
Apparently, he still looks like a thin uniform line.
With a far-reaching view now, thanks to the drawing, we're going to discover the porous dimension of more strains, so we're going to see the motive of image 2.
We can see clearly that the surface of the hadice is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and round.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but in addition to one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, a total of four space dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imaginations a little bit, note the illustration of obl.3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we're expanding the view of the geometry of the space just as we've expanded the surface of the Hague.
Each of the following levels represents a huge increase in the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (see them at the fourth level of enlargement), if they are wired into enough small space; thus we explain that we have not observed them so far.
The fourth network depicts a commonly known "great" dimension, while the circle is a new, small and porous dimension.
Just like the loops of a thread in a densely wrapped blanket, even these circles exist in every place of normal dimensions - only because of our perception we have drawn them only to the averages on the Thursday network.
The background picture 4 shows a commonly-known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in normal dimensions such as the meters shown by the side of the small square in the square grid.
On each of the following images, we will focus on a small area of the previous image; we will increase it to become visible.
At first, there's nothing special about it, as we see on a few first-level increases.
However, if we look at our path behind the microscopic properties of the geometry of the space further - at the fourth level of the magnification in image 3 - we will suddenly see a new, shape of a grayed dimension in the shape of the circle, similar to the shins or in a densely woven piece of copper.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circle dimension exists in every place in the direction of large dimensions as well as has had a circle circumference at each point of its length.
In the interest of opinion, we have drawn a circular dimension only in some, regularly distributed points.
Figure 4 The image of Kaluz and Klein on the microscopic structure of the geometry of the space is summarized.
The similarity to hadicia is obvious, although we also note important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), where the hadice has only one large dimension.
The even more important difference is that we're now talking about space geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, or our hives.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circularly curved dimension is extremely miniature, recognize it - as well as the circle circle haddice - much more difficult than to observe the obvious, large and wide dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will in fact be revealed above the strength of our most modern enhancement tools.
Most importantly, however, the additional dimension is not just a covered backbone within normal dimensions, as double-dimensional illustration mistakenly indicates.
The circle dimension is a new dimension, which exists at each point of three ordinary extended dimensions.
It is the size of the remaining three dimensions independent as are the dimensions of the mountains-down, the left-right and the front-back independent (and back) each other.
A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions and, in order to determine its position, we would need four data besides three common positions in the circular dimension; if we count time, then the data five, in each case, about one more than we would normally expect.

The price for e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, then, we find that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluzov and Klein's view that this does not exclude the existence of additional pig dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe can have a calmer dimension than we can see with a simple eye.
How small should they be?
The most modern technical equipment can recognise the structures of the billionth billion metres.
We can hardly see a small gray dimension.
In 1926 Klein combined the original Kaluz idea with several ideas from just parenting quantum mechanics.
Its calculations indicated that the additional circle dimension could have the size of about one Planc's length, i.e. the size far behind the different capabilities of today's devices.
Since then, physicists have been calling the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions of the Kaluz-Klein theory.
Wohnut Honza Homola advises how to practice electric guitar: 5th part
The whole substance of the "double" consists of a twelve-octagonal form, which you can either repeat.
Whoever taps in the music theory will find its principle explained here in detail.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
By training a ballplayer and a ballplayer whose facebook profile can be monitored here, from the age of twenty years ago, live as a graphic.
He's a guitarist of the Wahnout band, from which unfortunately he can't leave.
The guitarist is after his father, just like his brother Matthew, the leader of Wohnout.
Start training on one line.
"The rhythmic model is only for you, you can think of anything, then just apply it to the harmonic model twelve," says Honza.
If you add another line, you can swap the figure again.
Just listen to and watch Honz, what can be done with twelve harmony on two lines to think about and how well it's starting to sound.
If you pick up the third string, you can already pop some songs with the tunes.
When you finally add the fourth, attention to the change of the boat, the Honza notices in the video.
The next time Honza comes back to the pentatonium, you'll try to put it together with the twelve.
So practice it properly.
Best of all, you can read this in the conversation with Jan Homolo at his first lesson of his school game on the electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for the great celebration, it recognizes the castle Palace
We take the point and we like it.
For the first half, we had more chance, the second home," the attacker, who had been scored this time from the puddle.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, but you just accompanied her with a huge sand?
Somehow, I didn't notice it, even though on the second branch, where domestic fans are, it'd probably be worse.
You've settled the penalty after midnight, but you've also got the goal from the penalty in just four minutes.
What happened?
We fell asleep at the beginning, we were passive, it came out of the corner, and then there was a penalty.
You got up after her, and the first time you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree with the fact that we've been playing well until the end of the game.
In the cabin we said we wanted to keep the pace of the game, but we couldn't do it.
To tell the truth, I can't explain why.
But it's probably also true that the housewives said something about their game, they probably weren't very satisfied with it.
You've just scored at the rival's game for the first time, while you've probably not got a goal at home yet.
Why is it such a difference?
I wouldn't say it's such a difference, it's more up to us to deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Plzen, that's another category.
Four matches you were waiting for, you weren't afraid that after the last match could be similar?
Not at all, but of course we're glad that we don't have to talk about waiting for the goal from the last match.
Now we have added more without waiting, but there are still only three in the six matches, which is not yet for the great celebration.
Island - the lava flows from a mile away.
A lion flying on the surface in the area of Holhraun near the glacier of Vatnajökul, flows a underground tunnel from a km away.
It is located under the refrigerator, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This reality now concerns the most...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.)
2014) still flies out of the hatch approximately the same amount of mud.
In contrast to the original estimates, however, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
In contrast to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50x larger.
However, scientists are afraid that a lava tunnel could open even in places where it is under the ice.
If this happened, in addition to the similar intensity of the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the river Jökuls at Fjöll, and on the other rivers.
There is a strong smell of cheese around the eruption, a cloud of steam and gases rises out of the crack.
It is definitely not suitable for the tourism movement, as was the case in the case of the eruption at Fimvardzhals in 2010.
This is much bigger and there is much more gas," says Volcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
The weather, however, has improved considerably since yesterday, and in the early hours, it has been in the area of almost no wind.
The steps after the sandstorm were pushed by rain.
Scientists can continue in their work.
For air operations, the orange level (second highest) is applicable for Baradrbung and the yellow (third) for Aska.
The sky above Chebe was the brave Lady Peggy.
She's gone by the wings.
A summer day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17 machine, Peggy Valentin's acrobat was introduced, which in summer came out of the cockpit to the upper wing of the double wing and also between the wings.
It's only transferred to the muscle force.
The flight day in Cheb was already on fire this year, and the rowers again managed to prepare a number of interesting flight pieces.
The prime minister at the oldest Czech airport was not only "walking by the wings" in the administration of the German acrobatic Peggy Valentine, but also the legendary winner P-51 D Mustang or the Beechcraft 18th.
He was paying attention to his bright instincts.
Acrobaty called Wingwalking is the origin of the United States.
After World War I, many of the former war pilots were trying to reinstate themselves.
Only because of the large number of deadly attacks he was banned.
But today he's coming back to the flight day program slowly.
Peggy's gonna get out of the cockpit on the top wing after the start.
There's a variety of exercises.
At the end of the show, they move to space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues," Luděk Matejæček of the Czech Ultralight Club and the organizer of the flight day described.
The pilot of Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband, Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main grave of the program, then the next performance of Mustang's contest was the famous shaker on the cake.
The legendary achievement on the ground was accompanied by the Grippeny Army of the Czech Republic in the curtain (so-called numbers).
Such an assembly could be seen by the air fans in the Czech Republic for the first time.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavský then presented to everyone the breath of the acrobatics taking with a plane from 1945.
He was still made for war, but he probably never took part in it.
He was classified in military reserves.
Since 1963 he has been active in the civil field.
And like a racing plane.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich City.
In the same place is also another beechcraft C45H Expedible Pearl of the Czech Air Day, two-engine Beechcraft C45H.
He didn't go to the airport to check on the machine.
His depleted clay pot has gone into the distance.
Udiv also won the Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard machine in the colours of French aviation.
A small passenger plane jumped for the rejected Turbolet and brought a part of the German delegation to the airport on the day of departure from the German Hof.
Germany's neighbours in Cheb were introduced to reconstructed planes as 18T or as a triangular formation of Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic return in front of the camera!
The family care has replaced Lucie Borhy for at least tonight's work.
Stress or nervousness - blonde moderator knows nothing of it.
It was as if she had not stopped at all for two months!
It's only two weeks since the blondes ended on the six-weeks in which women experience the greatest stress after birth.
Lucie, however, will not show herself regularly in the main news release TV Nova.
Regular return is due according to information from Blesk.cz to month.
Only her daughter Linda now needs more than TV viewers.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a black hole.
Exhibits for a year in Prague?
Hala would be sold out, planning Jagr's wedding.
It would be honorable if something like this happened during the world's championship.
But it matters how the bond is built," he said in Jihlava after the exhibition called the Golden Race, where he again met a fascinating Nagan team.
And the players who participated in the gold hat trick.
The players would like to, wouldn't they?
Sure.
It would be very good to make a farewell to the golden generation during the championship.
I think they're allowed to find one two days during the tournament when it's completely free and where such a fight could be mixed up.
Let's say it to Gum (Jiřim Šlégrovi) or to Bédj Škerban (the party of the July Battle), who would take care of it...
The arena would be sold out.
But what if you're playing with New Jersey play-off?
So when I fly...
You don't want to play in representation.
Or did the July meeting change your decision?
Representations and exhibitions are two different things and the performances are decisive.
One thing is that people would like to see me there, but performances are crucial, especially to the world's championship.
There should be players who have it, not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed in any way.
How did you actually enjoy the Nagan search?
It was just a great meeting with the players.
A man brought back his stories and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans but also for us hockey players.
Of course, the most important thing was Ivan Hlink's honor.
And it's good to remind you of the history of our hockey and that there's a generation that's really been behind it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimir Rožička and Petr Čechmánek on the trigger.
You still have your first representation match on your own?
She doesn't forget things like that.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young men: me, Robert Holík, and Robert Reichel, we were in one three.
For all of them, it was the first performance start.
Well, if we were to dominate in some way, that's not what we can say.
In Jihlava for a long time, Dominik Hasek was captured.
What did you say about his performance?
Hasan will never surprise me on the ice.
I wanted to give it back to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hašek criticised Jagra for the reasons he decided to end his representation).
And the Hnilik has a great performance.
At the time, he used to train with me once in the night and there was a bull.
And now he's caught famous.
First the USA and then the Netherlands, football players begin qualification
On Monday morning, prominent guests took their seats to the NH Hotel.
People could have viewed as Peter Chech of Chelsea, the representative coach Paul Vrbu...
And over there, that black-headed character, it's Tomáš Rosicki!
The Lieutenant Arsenal and the captain of the representation arrived at a meeting of about a dozen of the last.
A beautiful match against the Netherlands awaits us.
Who wouldn't be happy?" he said when he was in the representative's office before the press.
Czech Representation Programme
Monday 1 September: start of strike, first training
Tuesday 2 September: Training open for fans (18:30, Summer) Autogramiada (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Latvia)
Tuesday September 9th Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Annual) end of strike
Russian and sex fans can support even before the U.S. mid-war (20:15).
The performance for them opened Tuesday's training, which begins at the Summer at 18:30.
And he'll follow the autographs that Russians and Czechs will not miss.
Otherwise, the national team will be calmer.
Which is to be commended by coach Vrba, who was complaining about a lot of social activities in the spring.
Finally, we will devote ourselves to what we want to devote ourselves to.
Now we're going to focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage if you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to train things that have not been so long," praised the Vorba, who has been leading the national team officially since January.
The Czech football team will carry out a Musketeer's image at the entrance to the new qualification cycle.
He's got three fights behind him, all ready.
With Norway and Finland, 2:2 a with Austria losing 1:2.
However, these results were not yet important.
That's it now.
The challenge with the Netherlands is the start of qualifications for the 2016 European Championships.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if the General was able to fight the United States.
The first half was to get to know each other.
Now the results are important.
We need to think about making ourselves successful," Vrba said.
The only player who has a three-year appointment with health problems is the attacker David Lafata.
He's suffering from a fever.
If he couldn't cure himself in the U.S. middle fight, Coach Vrba would have called another attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how after a misdiagnose for many years she thought she was going to die.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her teenage years thinking she was only a few years away.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and the pancreas.
The CMT UK Charity Organisation stated that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT, because it knows very little about the disease.
It is estimated that in the United Kingdom about 23,000 people suffer from CMT, which may show symptoms in the field of motor vehicles such as muscle weakness, insomnia, and broken toes.
In the case of the affected, inadvertentness or pain may also occur, this condition is treatable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Frederick Ataxia (FA) - a disease that has a very poor prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated the eighteenth birthday, she would be supported by a wheelchair, and dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two children, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same thing.
I fell down every day and it took me a long time.
I've never been able to ride with the other kids on my skateboards or skateboards, and at school, I was shocked by how I walked and ran."
When it was Rodgers' thirteen and it was after several operations that were supposed to release her Achilles' feet and fix her feet, she took advantage of her doctor leaving the room, and looked into her documentation, where she found out she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was following, and so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I returned home, I searched for information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” he says.
When they answered, I was in shock, I was just panicking.
I thought before I was eighteen, I would end up on my truck, and before I was fifty, I would be dead, and in the meantime I would lose all my abilities.
I was all alone, and I was planning a funeral."
When she was 17 years old, she realized that her ability to walk did not improve as much as she expected and asked her surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said: “Daughter, I don’t think you have a disease here, otherwise you’d be on your way.
I think it's going to be a much less dangerous life."
After graduating several genetic tests, it was found that he had CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT is, I thought I was a happy child," she said.
CMT Chartering Organisation UK launched a month of information about CMT to alert this disease.
Entrepreneurs in the area of Washington: taxes are taxed
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And also higher taxes.
According to a new survey published last week, state and local taxation by companies in the country with a rapid recovery of the economy increased slightly last year and the companies in Washington were no exception.
The entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia, together for the fiscal year 2013, put $27,6 billion in national and local deposits, which is 3,8 % higher than the $26,6 billion that was selected in 2012.
The tax burden - both public and local - increased by 4.3% last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year and was the third year of growth after 2009 and 2010 when the tax fell.
According to the study carried out by the professional company Ernst & Young and the Political Collection Center on State Taxation, public taxes increased faster by 4.3% than local deductions by 3.9%.
More than half of the county's tax revenues, 56%, is from life tax, and 36% of Maryland's income is from companies.
Virginia, with 28 %, shows the relatively minimum tax revenue from the company.
Researchers claim that the majority of the tax revenue growth is due to an increase in the value of the real estate of the companies, which increased the real estate tax this year after three years of growing -1 % by 3.7 %.
Although most profits come from large states like California, New York and Texas, the same situation seems to be in Washington.
The companies in D.C., Maryland and Vriginia paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, which compared to 9.6 billion in 2012 represents an annual increase of 4.2%.
However, there is a clear increase in the value of the real estate, but there is a lack of public and local tax revenue in Maryland, where the real estate tax represents a total of five companies' taxes.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., the property tax represents almost half of the state and local tax.
“In Maryland, it owns a lot of real estate companies, especially the tax base around D.C., government or non-profit organization that doesn’t pay taxes,” explained Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on, for example, income tax to pay for the same services that are in other countries.
The recent increase in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed only to the healing market with properties.
According to the data, revenue from the company is also increasing.
Companies in this region have taxed $2.3 billion from commercial companies, which have increased from 2.1 billion since 2012.
Maryland has selected one billion dollars for business income taxes, the largest in the region.
Although they are collected in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs does not grow in these three places as quickly as possible.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the level of the national average, at 4.3 %, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4.9 %.
Only in Virginia was an increase in tax on average, to 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest income tax of commercial companies of all three districts (of which all have the same tax) of 6 %.
The rate of tax on Maryland’s trading companies is 8,25 %, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, to 9,975 %.
A similar study carried out this year by the American Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower government and local taxes and a generally more favourable tax environment than Maryland.
D.C. did not evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed a tax reduction law from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and next year the tax is reduced to 5%.
If income targets continue to be met in the coming year, the rate of income tax fixed by law in 2017 could be reduced to 3 %.
According to a recent study with small businesses in Washington, this is why higher public and local taxes are being paid.
Life tax levied by small businesses as personal income tax - the structure of compensation for higher costs by price increases, according to which most companies are organised - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia increased by 20% last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers claim that the trend and state-of-the-art increase in food tax will probably continue next year, with overall revenue from sales for government and local governments increasing by 6.2% in comparison with the same period last year of the first three quarters of 2014.
Washington may, however, remain behind others, because the reduction of government expenditure is choosing its tax on the labour market.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's Novorusko and Lafat's knives
Will a new state emerge in Ukraine?
Putin called for a talk about Novoruska.
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the south-east of Ukraine, where government units with the prorussian rebels have been meeting since April.
He also warned European companies that, under the current regime of anti-Russia sanctions, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support provided to the West by the war of the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine, according to it, resists democratic values.
The end of the conflict, according to him, depends on Kyev, so he can't say when the Ukrainian crisis ends.
Any more sanctions for Russia?
Czech Republic has the right to disagree with parts
The European Commission, together with diplomats, has to propose a form of further anti-Russia sanctions, decided at the EU summit tonight.
The president of the Member States' meetings, Herman Van Rompuy, told reporters.
According to the Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals for the release of sanctions are to be made on Monday.
Tusk will be the new "President" Union.
Van Rompuye will replace in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the European Union at the summit of the European Council, i.e. the so-called EU President, who runs the top meetings of the Member States.
From December to two and a half years, Herman Van Rompuye will be replaced.
In front of the European diplomacy, Catherine Ashton's Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs will host Federica Mogherinová.
The Italy, which will thus become Vice-President of the future European Commission, still needs to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
The assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, but it's not about it.

There's a CIA manuscript, they needed a war, says Huml about shooting the MH17 flight.
The envoy for ČSSD Stanislav Huml has clearly in mind who shot the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is obvious that "the harsh sanctions that were declared in view of the shooting of a civilian plane with nearly 300 dead were intentionally caused by the Ukrainian army".
According to the law firm, it's also known the CIA's manuscript.
Unfulfillable promises.
Elections are approaching and the parties are again offering impossible
End of homeless people on the streets, parking for every family and canvas over Prague.
This is repeated before every election: the parties promise impossible.
Now, too, with the coming municipal elections, politicians are pushing ahead of those who prefer their loved ones.
The Lidovky.cz server has chosen the unfulfillable promises of the present and the past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovaks broke out at Dunkerque.
Concrete siege began
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovakian independent brigade moved to France.
Her commander Alois Liška has consistently requested the addition of technical equipment and dispatch to the front.
The British side finally declared and ranked this ground unit as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained in the power of the German army.
SOUHRN: Plzeň leads the league before the Prague "S", Liberec declassified Baník
Victoria Plzeň is the new leader of the football league, leading to a point in front of both Prague's "S".
Changes in the front of the table led to the defeat of glory 1:2 in Mladé Boleslav.
After two defeats, Sparta was remembered in the house - to - house league, with two Lafat's attacks defeating Jablonec.
The record victory in the year was signed by Liberec, who shot Baník Ostrava 6:0.

Family Joan Rivers: "We hold our fingers"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was taken to the hospital in New York City, but her daughter said today that she is not losing the hope that an 80-year-old comedian will recover.
"Thank you for your welcome and support," Melissa Rivers stated in today's statement.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to the rescue service, according to which she found the heart base at the Yorkville Endoscope in Upper East Side, as the source said.
Doctors intend to maintain it under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of its status, which remains “serious”.
The reactions did not allow for long, including ineffective online support from personalities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
Realita is a cross-sectioned title
There is no news (sorry) that the media are turning their titles into reality.
I know that the headlines are "sellers" of the newspaper, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who are nothing else.
And that's the fact that I've been suffering a lot lately, the louder the word is a curse.
This concerns, in particular, articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The titles "Israel attacked Gaza" are quite common.
Only in the text can you read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the fire rockets from the Gaza Strip, often during the declared period.
Then the title "Both sides have broken the line."
Is the news council aware that this process is directly involved in anti-Semitic situations that are growing across Europe (and not just there)?
It's not even been 60 years since the end of World War II.
So far, the people who survived Shaw are alive.
When I saw a video from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the words "Jewish pigs" and similar beliefs, I was trapped.
Is this what the world wants to finish with what didn't happen to Hitler?
Are our journalists aware that after the Jews they were destined to eliminate the Slavic?
Ladies and gentlemen, please give a little more attention to your work.
You've often been referred to as a watchdog democracy.
So defend her.
As long as he's here.
And defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to behave if any of our neighbours decided that the Czech nation would be eliminated and the Czech Republic would be removed from the world map?
Maybe you should also realize one more fact.
In the territory of the State of Israel, nearly 20% of the Arab population dwells.
And they're good there.
If you ask them why they don't go between "theirs," or Gaza, they'll answer you why would they do that?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security and health care (I have seen in my own eyes how in the private hospital of Hadassa, which is funded from the sponsorial gifts of the Jews from all over the world, they are usually also Arab and are understandablely treated there).
Hamas also attacks his Arab brothers with his arrows.
The only real help to Gaza, and this restless area, is to rescue Hamas and arm him.
And not judge Israel, either directly in the titles.
Inform about Hamas' practices, his abuse of people as human shields.
Inform that Hamas is intended to eliminate the state of Israel at any cost.
Even for the price of the death of innocent Arab children.
Inform them that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Please inform us that within nine years the Gaza Strip has been able to provide this area with humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity, which, of course, is not paid by the Gaza Strip, and is even disappointed that the supply of electricity is sometimes interrupted at this time.
If Hamas did not invest money in the construction of underground tunnels so that they could be persecuted by suicide attackers in the territory of Israel, but perhaps in the construction of homes, hospitals and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would be much better alive.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON just confirmed claims Information from Monday morning: Internet retailer - producer of videos and hundreds of other things - buys for $1.04 billion (970 million US dollars) video streaming service Twitch.
The announcement was not surprising because no one expected Twitch to buy, but because it was expected to be a YouTube buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitche Google for one billion was certain, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, who just founded Justin.tv three years ago, had been blinded to become a commonly used video streaming service - live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who sent online transmissions from the game - the words Business Insider "YouTube for live broadcasts".
Interaface Twitche.
On YouTube, there are already popular "Let's play" videos, a kind of where wise people (mostly older) play mystery science theatre.
The fact is that YouTube’s description ofTwitche comes across a lot, so the news that YouTube buysTwitch, which has not been shaken much, was a textbook example of how the company in question pays off the possible competition.
The argument is why the agreement with YouTube did not go out, although the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have at present is the CEO Twitche Emmet Sheara's statement: "We have chosen Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us meet it faster."
Another mystery is - honestly - the incredible success of Twitche.
For snobs like me, who claim that sport prefers to watch, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about, games instead of real play just to watch.
One thing is to watch a friend over his shoulder at three in the morning, as the Resident Evil plays, and the other thing is to observe someone else, how he gets twenty shots into his head at Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that many of today's, most popular games are from the perspective of players, so looking at their record, without you being able to control the perspective itself, is a pretty good recipe for how to arrange a doll.
I admit that games like speed run, in which Rogers Bannists our electronic times finish the game in record time, is fun.
But if someone is not a master of play or humor, his channel on Twitchi will probably not be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is fourth at the top of internet traffic.
How exactly does the Amazon use it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch is getting involved in Amazon Instant Video as elegant as it could have been on YouTube.
But Twitch has something that would like to attract every company: the hordes of young men who want the inserts.
As director Twitche Shear, Amazon and Twitch "believes in the future game" and the media don't seem to be daring, or like -- sexing -- spectators.
The second basic lie to creationism.
Another Czech translation of American atheistic blogger Aaron Ra.
This time on the theme "Holy Letters Are God's Word."
The original video is attached.
The second basic lie to creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of many things that are contrary to their religion, they often ask us, Who will you believe?
To God's Word or to man's word?
It's as if human research was completely harmless compared to the authority they think it has their doctrine.
Only when they say "man," they talk about science.
And when they refer to "the word of God," they refer to myths about the people who were written.
If there really exists intelligent with the creator for some purpose, then it is he who created a fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and it must be he who added another series of evidence that shows exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion in the final detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It looks like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people will get to tell stories, to falsify.
And it was people who wrote all the texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposed sacred teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as the people who are buried, not the gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictation of angels, but those texts were not written by any other than mere mortals with certain level of imagination, not angels and no gods at all.
If there really was one real god, it would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, supergalactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the whole space.
If the creature of such a size had ever written a book, there would have been only one such book, the only holy letter.
It would be known everywhere, without precedents, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors could not measure themselves with such work.
And people would not have to blindly believe it because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and would manifest a deep moral and wisdom far beyond any human limit.
It would have inspired every reader to unite the common faith.
If God had written it, we wouldn't have expected anything less.
Only what we see instead is exactly the opposite.
Instead of the only religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without common origin, and all of them continue to divide into more and more distinct denominations, searching for disputed truths, and in every way challenging God’s guidance, regardless of the continuous expansion and division in every direction.
Jewish Torah, Christian Gospel, Islamic Koran, Bahá'u'lláhov Kitab-i-Akdás, Zarathustrova Avesty, Sikh Adi-Grant, Mahabharátsk Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the Book of Urantia are all regarded as "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the only true God" and the respective believers say that those others are in luck.
The only logical explanation is that they are all on the way to a certain degree.
None of the abovementioned books have any other advantages.
None of them have any evidence and none of them can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at the West Michigan University.
I do not say that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and apologizing (obhajobs), because they contain inequalities, absurdities and primitive ideas once considered to be true ones who have already been overcome.
So it cannot be claimed that they are evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote superstitions instead of antagonism, and many of them claim to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of the prophecy - that everyone can also contain the prophecy that was not fulfilled.
Early theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands, so they are the subject of interpretations, perceptions and views of their primitive and often predestinations of the politically motivated authors, which explain many of the contradictions and inequalities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, more mutual comments.
We need to point out again that we have two different authors here whose work was somewhat mixed together during some editorial review.
It's true that Genesis has more than one author, and he's certainly not telling an eye witness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for Pentateuch, i.e. five books of the "Moses" and Moses are not signing authority to any of them, because it was almost certainly not there as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably Ezdraš) of several mutually impermissible oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
Other documents have been re-filtered at the same time and are all attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as her believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are much younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed the teachings and ebony and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in a compromise called orthodox.
Other Christian groups, such as the Luciferians, were distinguished and distinguished by other Bible revisions.
One of these rules applies to King Ugarita who ruled 3500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a fundamental threat to the young Mossian religion, the authors of the New Law decided to ridicule and Ba'al Zebula, "Lord of the Mountain" changed to "Lord of the Moss."
So the Bible was deliberately and subversively modified for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what became the New Law was canonized in the fourth century B.C.E. in a series of Commission decisions in the winter in Nikai.
Four Gospels were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected by a simple raising of their hands, as if the reality could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon developed depends on what was read on Sundays in the Christian centers of the day.
What was read on the second Sunday after the grandeur of the Jerusalem Church?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually learned that he was drawing close to the same Gospel accounts.
And that's how the core of the cannon developed from the edge of the original church.
So the council simply accepted as an evangelical any relevant stories that circulated among the untrained masses at that time.
Still, they readily accepted more than ten books from the Bible, even though they referred to them as books that were approved.
We find records of both the apostles and the prophets among those who refused to do so.
Why should God’s Word refer us to books that are just words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could she be so approved if God were the true author of this random mixture of legends, similarities, and mourners?
The Bible was certainly written by people and certainly not by too much enlightenment, rather by the contrary!
That's why so much of its historical and scientific content is completely wrong, whether it's almost anything from the beginning to the end.
We're talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could speak, believe in superstitions, bloody victims, ritual magic, enchanted objects, fire readings, astrology and five lives of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic rope that they called blood, they would cure him from leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought the rabbits were survivors and the bats are birds and the whales are fish and drink that's the whole number.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cow-shaped patterns, they would give birth to dried calves.
How could anyone say this about genetics?
The authors of this book, of course, didn't know.
If the Bible were written in a higher form, it would not contain the mistakes it contains.
If it came from the pen, a truly superior being and was meant to be a literal history, then it would not contain anything of what it contains.
As a moral guide totally fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who looked at or supported cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, abuse of slaves, abuse of family members, abuse of children, child abuse, loss of children, rape, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against race, nation, religion, sex and sexual orientation.
To defend their folly by claiming to do God’s will.
But the creationists are still ignoring this.
Some of their websites admit that if there is any truth in the Bible, then the truth must be ignored!
And why?
Because if the creationists did not have their loving books, they would not have God.
In their world there is one and the other the same.
It's ironic that they reject God's "work" as "honoring creation instead of the Creator."
But they themselves consider man's word to be the word of God and the God of himself, and they even insist that the eviction of their supposed "holy" books somehow misleads God as such.
Not their version of God, but all the versions of God.
Creative Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and that the Bible could at the same time be mistaken because it cannot separate the doctrine from God.
So it is a kind of modeling, where believers worship a man - made compilation, as if these books were God himself, for they think they are Jehovah’s Word.
Only God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected into their supposed "unchangeable word" of any god has been invented, constructed, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified, and often deliberately changed and crossed by only the wrong people.

Three of the nine people who stabbed died later in the hospital.
Chechen later killed himself with a high jump, introduced New China with a link to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public therefore calls for greater security measures and better protection of children in a country where there are many married couples in accordance with government policy only one offspring.
Zeman showed his cousins in Láne how he had to be at school.
The youngest schoolchildren took nine to their class, where the teacher and the teacher were waiting for the president's arrival.
Then he showed the kids how he had to sit alone at school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind your back, it's no longer waiting for you, you're already free people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then handed the firstborn as a gift to the head.
President Milos Zeman in the first class of elementary school in Láne.
Minister of Education Marcel Chládek started a new school year in private sports school in Lithuania.
"This year I want to connect more Czech school with Czech sport," one of the reasons why the first day of school was spent in northern Czech.
The school's leadership spoke to him earlier on a hockey game in Lithuania.
"They were the first, so I accepted an invitation to attend the school year," the minister added.
Minister of Education Marcel Chládek (CSSD) started a school year at a private sports school in Lithuania.
In the first classes of the year, there were 115 thousand firstlings.
The primary school will take over 850 thousand children in total and over 405 thousand students in secondary schools will be educated, the Ministry of Education estimates.
The new art director of the news is David Fiala
The new art director of news and television advertising of Nova became David Fiala since September 1.
In the function, Alan Zarubu was the leader of the creation department of the entire Nova group since June 1.
David Fiala had previously acted in the graphic department of the Z1 news station.
For the last two years, Alana Zaruby has been involved in the implementation of a complete visual change in news reports Television News, Streppina, Prask! and other advertising shows of Nova TV.
David Fiala has a very good communication synergy between the editors, studio management and the graphic department, which is the basis of the work of the art director of the news.
He has a sense of typography and pure elegant design, which is the way we want to go in the vision of the news of New," says creative director New Alan Záruba.
Apple iCloud allegedly was under hackers, our images of celebrities were made public.
Screenshot of the output of remote files
So far, the anonymous user on server 4chan publishes naked and pornographic images of American celebrities, alerted the American server Machable.com.
Apparently, he gained an incorrect access to user accounts on Apple servers, where the user's disability was recorded through automatic storage of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple hasn't been in trouble yet.
Part of the celebrity rejects images as falsified, but several of the affected images have already admitted.
Among them is an actress Jennifer Lawrence, known as Katniss in the film series Hunger Games or Mary Elizabeth Winsteado, who played for example in the Deathly Fate 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the images and videos obtained to enrich.
The recordings allegedly showed interest in American magazines, according to reports on server 4chan, but hacker wants better money from the community.
According to The Next Web server, it is very likely that there is a weakness in iCloud security.
On the GitHub server, a tool was found two days ago that enabled you to get passwords to your user accounts through a hard force, i.e. by automatically repeating attempts to log in with different passwords.
This tool was obviously working, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had a lot of time to gain access to different accounts before the publication of this instrument.
ICloud users should therefore change their password associated with Apple ID for preventive reasons.
The length of the password, not its complexity, is important.
The length is at least 12 characters.
Avoid naked images of celebrities to consider the safe use of online services.
Although servers are companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft, provided much better than computers in households or smaller companies, uploading sensitive photos in unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to store explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, first encrypt files before uploading.
It is also reasonable to set automatic storage of photos from the phone so that it only runs on the wi-fi and after connection to the charger.
Then you will be able to temporarily sensitive images move "to security", and mainly you will have space to erase unauthorized images, so they will not necessarily take space in the online store.
How to encrypt files and communications on the Internet, we offer HN and IHNED.cz readers in the form of an electronic book from Michal Altaira Valáška in PDF format.
Smart way to save for high school scripts
Since the price for a university script for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, the current student of the second year came with a smart way to reduce costs.
He invented a system of lending books from associates from seniors with the offer of nominal compensation to keep their sales back.
"The book on calculations, which is usually worth 180 dollars, I got in the semester for ten and for chicken nuggets," says Schroeder, 19, who studies at the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would be $430, he says.
I lost 120.
According to the University Council, the average student loses more than $1,200 per year for textbooks and grants, but students have different options to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students is online shops and creative solutions such as Schroeder's.
On the rise is the lending of the textbooks, which allows students to use the semester of the book, often with a significant discount, before they buy it.
Or Inc operating more than 250 bookstores in campus areas says that lending books has doubled since 2011.
Research in the sector shows that around a quarter of the books in university bookstores were borrowed in the last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the teaching texts are purchased by the National Association of University Trades in University Bookstores.
Here's 101 of the best ways to get there.
Shopping online
The prices of some new books may be less than a third on the Internet than in the university bookstore.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostettler is almost $290, but on the Internet it is possible to buy a new $239.99 at Chegg.com, a retail shop specialized in the textbook.
Buy Used
If you do not mind the comments of other people or the consumption and destruction, appropriate teaching texts are used.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says that at Amazon.com he paid for the "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" 42 cents.
The new guy was selling for $48.
University Teacher Ingrid Bracey, Head of University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls suggests that students in their teachers check that older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes there are no significant changes to the work at the seminars.
If so, the oldest editions may be sold for a fraction of the last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, they are the preferred alternative for buying used books also eBay Inc's Half.com.
Loans
If you do well with them, you will not forget to return them and you will not need to have them after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost for the new book.
For example, the student could borrow "Calculus" for about twenty dollars throughout the semester.
List the terms and conditions of the trade in which you borrow the book, including the effect on notes, accentuation or consumption and damage.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book in time, the discount may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-mail
Another option is to check out the standard e-book instead.
Sometimes these books are basically borrowed in the form of electronic licenses valid after a certain period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows "Calculus" for six months for about 61 dollars.
According to Bracey, the most useful offers can be found by students of literary courses, because many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go after the shops.
Joe Gault, 29 who will soon be on Pepperdine Law School, recommends driving according to the ISBN, because it guarantees that you buy the right book.
Before ordering your book over the Internet, make sure it's really in stock, advises Gault.
He convinced himself of it on his own skin.
The book he bought was sold for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for the book from the university bookstore.
It's a bad thing, it's a bad thing.
And then they found guns in the cold tower at the end of the war.
This barn is a piece from the church of St. Jirí.
We discovered the growth around and we started to pull out the flying slope - about a meter and a half of the track and the snowboard.
As we got close to the big day, we hit the head," said Radomil Novak.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up and found it was a tortoise of German rifles used by SS units.
The finding is probably unusual.
According to my information, these rifles were manufactured until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," Novak added.
All the wooden construction things have spread over time, so it's useless.
Her body is, of course, preserved - keeps its shape.
How's the cold feeling?
There's one explanation.
Maybe she was put there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by SS units, probably from fear of being removed.
The Fascists would probably not do that.
They threw weapons in the woods," he thinks he's gonna find.
The gun was the only one that the spirits of the Move of the Spirit of the Jessenics found in the barn.
"There could have been hand grenades, there used to be a lot around them, so we slowed down the funeral work, carefully examined the path, so that there was no accident, but there was nothing else down there," Novak approached.
The discovery will end in the museum's depositary at the castle in the nearby Slezky Rudoltics.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet released the occupied Czech
Exclusive interview Currently.cz with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from capture of the prosecutors.
Kyev/Praha - "I'm sorry, I have to take it... they're calling me from Donecka," he apologized eight times during the exclusive conversation with Aktuálno.cz Ukrainian General Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, or also the director of the Dark Centre for the Liberation of War prisoners.
Lieutenant General Volodymyr Ruban in the television debate.
In any such interruption, it was not possible to hear the names of people, their numbers or places where they were - or should be - that Ruban is clarifying with his opponent at the other end of the phone.
"That's it, go there," he arranged one of the flash discussions with Doneck and again dedicated himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in stock, a pilot of the race, and an active participant in protest protests in Majdan.
Yesterday, when we had a conversation, he was in Doneck.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the occupation of the prosecutors shall be paid for forty-four hours a day.
Currently.cz: You may know that on the part of the prorussian separatists, the Czechs are fighting.
Our controversy estimates their number to thirty.
It can be a lot more, though.
Have you ever met a Czech prisoner in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I've already freed captured Serbs, Dagestans, Chechens, one Swedish, Georgians... but the Czechs are not yet.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we hit your captured country and we could free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured separatists
A.cz: What advice do you give to the Czechs who join the prosecutors and Ukrainian soldiers to take care of them?
They should understand that if, as the Czechs, they fight in Ukrainian flags of volunteers and separatists take them, they will be shot without mercy, just like any other foreigner.
The separatists consider these men to be the tenants, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
For example, if Ukrainian soldiers occupy a group of donnese separatists - and therefore the Czechs - they will sit on the net and deal with him as a prisoner of war.
That guy's gonna be alive soon.
The Ukrainian side also acts as a state in war.
A.cz: How many of you have been able to save Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand that well, I'll exchange it.
Some sources indicate that hundreds of men have already exceeded that.
Long time ago, we stopped counting how many people we helped.
We just freed them... from the war, if they decide to continue in their struggles.
Rescuers are doctors, surgeons, but we certainly don't.
That's it.
And there's another and the next one every day.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, another four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes it's enough to let the prisoners go, and it's just a human request.
A.cz: It is claimed that in a few months' time, you have gained great authority and even trust among the prorussian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you build respect for both sides of the war?
It's a tough question.
One of the officers in Kyiv gave me the nickname "crazy general with steel balls."
It doesn't bother me.
And maybe that's the essence of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Departmental Assembly, I've had some authority before.
I never run, I never cheat, and I always keep my word.
Whatever happens, I act honestly and tell the truth.
Even when it's the Ukrainian government, or the nun or luhansk very unpleasant.
If they torture and kill people?
So I'm just telling them they're tortured and killed.
And that they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even when I'm being exchanged by the prisoners and I get caught... this job can always mean the end... I don't have to come back.
A.cz: How many corrections and tortures do you know about prisoners?
... (long strawberry) To torture prisoners, Ukrainians and separatists are being deprived of hearings.
I'm sorry.
What about the repairs?
You're only playing on the side of the screen.
The fact that the Ukrainian army is also repairing the prisoners, I have no information.
No sign of the Ukrainian army accepting something like that.
We have an idea about the amount of corrections, but I can't, and I don't even want to give you the numbers.
A.cz: Describe the characters and motives of the prorussian separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They seek independence and perhaps democracy in Doneck or Luhansk - at least they say so.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
Separatists already have their teeth full of oligarchs and are their unscrupulous resistance to life and death.
As we say, they've been taken to the back.
The same dreams and complaints were made by people, by the way, even in Majdan.
And now I'm kind of wondering: Russia supports separatists and the West, on the contrary, the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be a big one and the other to be a small one.
This is my sentence, but there's an insurmountable conflict in it.
A.cz: For example, how do you see one of the strongest leaders of the Peruvian separatists Igor Besler?
Whenever I cross the line of war fronts, I'm unarmed and I show soldiers or armed men unarmed with their bare hands.
And I'm always on both sides of those two hundred or three hundred meters on a man or in an optical focuser.
The faces of the people who are looking at me, I always see well... and they can always push their weapons off.
Exhibitor, experienced Colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He is considered a Russian officer, but his family - mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a small government in a great Russian empire.
In any case, he is constantly talking about it and he considers Ukraine to be some kind of misunderstanding.
He said that such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is the enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in a discussion show of Ukrainian TV, your Prime Minister Arsenija Jaceňuk identified himself as a weak, unemployed and tired "leader", who would do the best if he left quickly.
I'll always get at least five fears in the three hundred meters.
So why should I hide myself with the view that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is damaging our country?
A.cz: Do you think it's part of the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians of Jaceňka are nicknamed "King."
And the king is not in the eyes of the Ukrainians an animal from which he would be afraid or should have other respect and authority.
His behavior directly duplicates the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as a prime minister in the war he has no right to cry in parliament, ask him to play with him his intrigues, to threaten that he sets a function... he has to run the country, manage it and at the time of war and protect it.
When threatened by the country, the prime minister does not have a claim for family, friends, rest for payable emotions.
He's the first of Ukraine's ministers.
What about Jaceňuk?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yeah, he's tired, but he's also weak, because he's never strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save the markets
Extraordinary 3 Sylvester Stallone returned from the $190 million budget in the United States less than $30 million and Sin City: Women for whom I would have been murdered, I would have returned from the $17 million budget only 12 million.
The movie Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz during the first weekend made only $14.6 million and also movies for children like How to Train Dragon 2 were for film disappointment.
According to Robbie Collin's book on telegraph, children's films are of their own quality.
Collin marked 2014 as "the worst" year of children's films and How to Train Dragon 2 called only "functional" continuation.
When it comes to films on a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem does not necessarily have to be in the quality of the film itself.
In July, the Entertainment Weekly servers CinemaScore and Metacritic and their average rating of the annual movie premieres broadcast in at least 2,000 cinemas during the War Victims Day and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results taken into account by viewers and film critics indicate that this year’s film crop is similar to last year’s hits.
According to some commentators, there may be a change in access to viewers and a higher popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s jungle book processing, said the Hollywood Reporter website, “I think times are changing.”
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what's already happened.
Unlike the current crisis in the Hollywood cash market, Netflix has won $1.2 billion thanks to Internet services, almost twice as much as last year's $837 million.
Last year, director Steven Spielberg criticised the study because they relied too much on the rights of comics, and predicted the "degradation" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators say that there may be something on his catastrophic skill.
With the introduction of possible large cash markets in the summer of 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minimons and the Jursk world, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
The producer X-Men Simon Kinberg recently marked a decrease in markets for simple "cyclical". For Hollywood Reporter, he said: "The next summer will be the summer of the biggest cash markets in history and no one will worry about selling."
KLDR again threatens Soul, fires another short-run missile
North Korea fired another short-run missile into the sea, Sul announced.
The supposed missile test took place shortly after the end of the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Pchjongang considered as preparation for the invasion.
The province of Chagang lies on the northwest of KDLR at borders with China.
According to the DPA, the Yugoslav Ministry of Defence spokesperson stated that the shots were fired from the site in the north-west of the KLDR and flew about 200 kilometres away.
So North Korea was probably the first to fire a rocket from the province of Chagagan, the South Korean media launched with a call for military rounds.
In the province there is a subterranean firefighting ramp for Scud-type rockets.
This is another series of similar tests that the isolated North Korean regime has carried out in recent weeks.
North Korea this year carried out an unusually large number of rocket and missile tests.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, protests were held against NATO's Newport summit.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered at the center of Newport to attend the march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff's workshop for a meeting that was described as anti-assuming.
Stephen Fairclough was watching the weekend situation and talking to protestors who had arrived from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be transported by air from the Blue Mountains
Two young tourists were picked up by the plane and transferred to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
Sixteen-year-old girl and eighteen-year-old man took a trip to Govetts Leap in Blackheath on Sunday afternoon.
When they didn't come home, the family's concerns called at eight o'clock the night of the police.
She was sent on a patrol including local police and rescue team, and a few were found near Bridal Veil Falls about eleven hours last night.
The girl fell on her knees, and the man fell down, and then he fell in the head.
The cops stayed with them overnight, and they were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stabilised state, they were transferred to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only the point from Opava, the win had on your leg
The only 23-year-old forvard could decide, in two of the biggest chances, but failed.
After the goal, she called, mainly, about three minutes before the end, but ended up in the network on the barber of Opava Joseph Kvétonová.
I had it on my leg, I have to give it a chance.
I'm mad at myself," your ass fell asleep on his head.
"Maybe I should have put it up under the wind, it kind of sat down," he said.
Sigmy's defense did not allow the Pope much, except for Mikul's 11-minute drive, which covered the Golman Reichl.
Then they began to press Hanáci, but in the block, the defenders didn't let them go and shot them from far away caught the Flower.
We compared fifteen minutes, and then we took the initiative.
In the second half, we were better, we had more of the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But the chance of yours never changed, so it ended at 0:0," hated coach Hanák Leoš Kalvod.
Opava also took the spot because of the absences in the compound, in addition to the missing two wounded Petr Vavřík with the three-point shooter Petr Ševčík, who in Slezska are hosting from Sigma.
It was not possible for them, unlike their previous policy.
The alternates deserve an absolute.
Sigma acted more football, but until one standard we did not leave her to anything," Slezanů Petr Baránek said.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression, and fighting.
Remiza is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma got a remix on four points, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the leader of the club Joseph Lébra, who, after defeating Znojmem, made his millions contribution to the diametrically different performances in other matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lebra's warning, so it can't be said that the boys would not want to fight," Calvoda noted and added to the address of the sleeping shooter, "I believe it will come and when it hits the target, it will start to fall there.
But after the first blow, I'm gonna get him to run the balls for another fight," he laughed at Kalvoda.
Al Pacino hit Benátky twice.
Film festival otherwise survives the crisis
After a great enthusiasm for Birdman’s opening film, whose director Alejandro González Iňárritus had arranged the race among the serious candidates in the Golden Lion, the next days gave evidence that the interest of the 71st year festival in the Benátka was somewhat waded.
Whether it was because the number of seats in the largest hall increased to fourteen, or because Birdman followed the criticisms recognized, but for viewers less attractive images as a document of genocide in Indonesia 60 years ago With a view to silence and other films with social themes from the American 99 homes after the Iranian story, there was a short sitting in the cinemas.
Helicopter of comics
Even a red blanket in front of the festival palace has not yet covered such gifts as in the past, and it has apparently stopped being the problem of finding a place in the hotel for the last time.
The crisis in Italy is spoken of more than anywhere else, and it is not surprising that it has reached as many institutions as Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Unfortunately, the crisis does not show a lack of personality, but present especially in relation to films.
While the younger fans yearned for the autographs of comic superheroes by Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who had successfully performed dramatic roles in 99 homes, for all generations there was no difference.
He's locked up in two movies right now.
In the story of the Explanation mentioned by the competition that filmed Oscar Barry Levison according to the novel Philip Roth, he has a 40-year-old Pacino role that is close to him: actors at the top of fame who suffer from depressions from the end of their career and personal life.
But seeing him the next day as the strange owner of the railway from the rural town of Manglehorn, which David Gordon Green made, was a truly unforgettable experience.
Volpi's cup for the best artistic performance should not miss it - but does the artist still have Pacin's format needs prices?
It may be the greatest gratifying love of the public for him, and that of the Italian especially, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino boasts of the country from which his cousins come.
Body for Italy
Most of the Italian films are doing very well in Venice this year.
The Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first image of Birdman in a long-lasting rise.
The caliber mafia is viewed in it as a family relationship between clans that fight for power and money, and the director has been able to match all the assumptions for a good movie: a quality scenario, camera, music and actors.
He also took the chamber psychothriller Cold Heart, who filmed Saverio Costanza with Albo Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost loses her own child in her recent anxiety.
On the contrary, the French competition films did not welcome the warm reception of neither the Compulsory for Glory, nor the 3 Hearts, both of which overlap on the traditional model of consumer films based on the popularity of the actors.
But in the end, two really great movies, Birdman and Black Soul, aren't so little at the first half of the festival.
And although the festival images have all the depressing subjects, Peter Bogdanoviche's new image called She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy mentioned in Venice outside the competition and filmed in the style of American cheerleaders for 40 years, has been able to raise the mood for more than one day.
Police arrested four pervitin producers in Prague, vehicles from Poland
"The detectives detained three men in the last days at the age of 42, 42 and 37 and a five-year-old woman who produced and sold pervitin drugs in Prague from last November to August," said police spokesman Jana Rössler.
First of all, on Tuesday, August 12th, an intervention unit in the Cillářska street caught an organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who represented in the group as a buyer of medicines in Poland and a seller of doses.
The following day, the detectives detained on the basis of the prior consent of the national representative of the next member of the group, a man of seventy years.
The last of the four police officers arrived in the middle of the morning hours of August 20th in the Malesque burning area," the speaker described.
For the transport of drugs from Poland, a third woman received drugs
The main organizer had a wide range of activities.
In the workshop of the airport area, in the garden house in Horomeřice, in the apartment in Konevova Street and other places in Prague, he produced pervitin, provided various aids and chemicals needed for its production and provided the transportation of medicines with pseudoefedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He also weighed the manufactured drug, divided it into plastic bags, and then sold the pervitin.
With the transfer of drugs from Poland or the sale of drugs, he has been helping him for five and a half years, a woman who has not yet been punished.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drugs manufactured," Rössler added.
On the basis of the judge's order, the criminals also carried out a number of home visits, where they provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, pay bags, injection syringes, hoses and other aids and articles that can be considered as complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
Dealer has been punished seven times since 1995
"From the available records, the police have found that since 1995, the chief organizer has been tried seven times for property criminal activity, and the woman who has not been tried," the police spokesman added.
The latter was detained in 2006 on condition that the criminal offence of sexual abuse and the seven-year-old car mechanic, who has been released, has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
And with him, it was mostly a criminal activity.
The investigator accused three men and women of committing a criminal offence of unlawful production and other loading with mindless and psychotropic substances and poisons, which threatens them up to decades of imprisonment.
In the end, three persons were asked by the investigator to invite the State representative to submit a proposal to establish the link where the judge finally placed them," the speaker said.
The fourth defendant, a seven-year-old recidivist, was released.
His position and role in this case was not as fundamental as in other defendants.
The cops are still working with this man.
Ferraris offer chess from wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers within its other products very interesting things for a lot of "interestful" prices.

The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
It doesn't make any sense to drop high school and high school.
In addition, the Czech Republic has few generally educated people and statistics show that gymnasts have good application.
The beginning of school year is here.
In the last 14 days, large preparations have been made in schools.
Most of these are routine matters, such as transporting flowers from the summer warehouse back to the class and painting the wings.
They're going to have a little more brakes in the hot gymnasium.
A few days before the start of the season, they search for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature in the library.
There was no robbery or deception, the four-year high school in the mountains opens and renews its activity after three years.
Not on the public, but on the private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the inability of the founders.
They had to wait for the existence of the school to be confirmed by entering the register of schools managed by the MSMT.
"French socialists should shut down and put France in order," said key associate Francoise Holland
Valls calls on the heavily fragmented left to "show its support" to a war-lorded socialist president whose new division of functions was not met with the consent of most of the French.
The President deserves general respect, loyalty, support.
"Our duty is to stay behind him," he said and bowed down.
As a calm gesture, the president of the government insisted that his government would not question the controversial French three-and-five-hour work week, despite the passionate advances by Emmanuel Macron, a new finance minister who proposed to set the rules free at the beginning of the week.
On Saturday, the Dutch asked the Socialists to remain "consistent" with the government.
Christiane Taubirová, Minister of Justice, made a line through the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebel Socialist MPs, where she criticised the Socialist side for "the French have lost faith in the future."
Marine Le Pen, a leader of extremely conservative rights, with persistent internal disputes between the socialists laughed when she declared that she did not assume that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls was also forced to set up a new government when the former did not last until the end of the years.
"And the new will not last until the end of the winter or the winter," Le Pen told his supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for Parliament's dissolution and stated that she was convinced that it could win the preliminary elections and that it was ready to rule the country.
The French ruling party suffered defeat in March's municipal elections and in May extremely conservative rights succeeded in elections to the European Parliament.
According to a survey by Journal du Dimanche, 76% of the French feel that the Socialist Party is at risk of dividing itself into several rival groups even before the end of Holland’s operating period in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French will soon have patience if the new socialist government is not able to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that there are changes in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could worsen.
Hazard and street art no longer limits Prague's election
Changes to the relevant statements should be prepared and approved by the new headquarters.
From the streets of Prague, there will be no more games in front of the municipal elections and the city will not limit street art.
There will be no limit to the wedding of dogs.
Prague shall not reach the October elections to prepare and approve the amendment of the relevant statements.
"In addition, the decision on changes should not be made by the current city management, which ends in several weeks' term," said Councilmanhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, several councillors, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to cancel a land-wide gambling accident.
Herry's not missing, the gambling statement is not going to change until now.
It's the task of new city leadership after election.
We would not technically achieve this now, for example, in terms of time to comment and so on," Manhattan explained.
He added that the last of the current representative's proceedings, which must be approved by the amendment of the notice, will take place on 11 September.
The referendum on the territorial ban on gambling will take place on the day of the municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8.
A gambling ban is currently in force, for example in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the statement will not change in the case of street art, so-called busking.
In particular, he complains about Prague 1, which has already sent the magistrate a proposal for a place that he would like to extend to the current list of prohibited places.
The musicians also don't want Prague 5 around Angela.
A report on the city's wedding of dogs is coming for several months, so far it's not finished.
The location of the game and the problem of the busking solves city statements.
It may be issued or amended only by the representative of the capital.
The councils have only a advisory vote, they can't issue statements themselves.
Last week he put victory to the Scottish independence proponents on the reach of the hand
The campaign for Scotland's independence was in danger of making this mistake the last time she almost put on billboards all over Scotland wondering if Scotti wanted to be rich.
But you will not get to the hearts of the Scottish people by appealing to their wallets, nor will you gain their respect when you start threatening them.
The morale of the New Law is still alive in Scotland, even though only a few Scotlands still go to church today.
Scotts have a far greater tendency to avoid changers from the temple than to let them dictate how they should vote.
The head of Scottish nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, and therefore in the television discussion he repeatedly questioned his rival, Unionist Darling, whether he would be willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people", if the Scottish voters voted for independence, and begin to support the single currency for Scotland and England.
It made Darling choose between Scottish civil society and the London financiers, and he got into this trap with a grima.
Of course, Darling does not support the mandate of the Scottish volunteers.
However, the debate on what Scotland will have the currency has already been more neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and the protection of public health that citizens have free of charge.
Darling supported the London banker in the matter of the currency and also raised the impression that he would not protest against the privatization of health.
As Salmon said, he went into bed with the conservatives.
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish policy.
Every Scottish fan knows that the Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with the conservative.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke in Scotland, not to the wishes of the bosses, but to the British Industry Confederation.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmonde was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a missing housekeeper.
Scotland would respect him if he came to debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron at least managed to say that Scotland could be "a successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it affects him almost physical pain.
What he's saying is clear: Scotts don't jump and have to accept what they are.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pessimistic start of school according to Milos Urban
Illustration to the story Longest year
Miloš Urban Longest year
The end of the holidays was the best, the last week that's gone nowhere, and we were just humming around with Grandma's summer, quiet in front of the storm, calm in front of the stress.
A new suit when it came out of Tuzex, boots from East Germany.
Reading the Fast Arrows, already pedestaled, hanging on a circle up around the Imperial to the back behind the Vary, somewhere to tennis courts, there was no water, the sun starved back and shoulder, stuck the paprusky on the divorced.
Tonight a little nervousness, still an idle regime, sleep until midnight, in a week it'll get worse, just before bedtime, they'll take a couple of minutes for two hours, then get up in the morning at 7:00.
It'll be Monday.
Most people don't, on the other hand, in summer, they're making a bad mistake in front of school.
Applicable in a flashlight on a plate and look like a plastic plug in a glass tray, there's this school, ZDŠ A.
The backdrop with a dirty pink charm, and before it the old known faces and a few new, the boys more attractive, the girls more posh.
There are predators, they avoid them, they're just as interesting as they keep their relationship unhappily and they're here soon.
And these grown-up girls who came screaming now hysterically laugh at something, maybe something changed in their life during the holidays, while everything is at my place at the old time.
And the new cousins, some nerves and other joys, why are they even here?
Because it has to be an educational military duty.
So inside, the cold humidity of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, the poisoned schoolboy with the mope, unfortunately, still the same thing that lends the pupils a key from the patch box, where they can keep the textbooks and which are still so few.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dress is still in memory, now it's not good, it's pretty blown up, but it's gonna get worse in a week.
It's the only way out of the picture is the stomach, and it's starting to get the headache.
The head, which is even worse to learn from mathematics, that devilish game for the chosen, among which I don't belong, and I'll never be.
Again, those three and fours, there are no fives, hide before the test, go into the barn and get the best out of it, be there, exist only as a name in the classroom and dream about nicer girls and beautiful buildings, about antennas in space where no one bothers with anyone, does not humiliate anyone and does not insult anyone's feet.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, now as it was years ago.
The birth daughter left her to die.
She's threatened with an exceptional punishment - News.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in the public toilet cabin at the bus station in Jihlava.
With no help from a stranger, she was born a girl who, after cutting the doll, hid it under the bundo and took it to a road guide, where she was put into a few hundred metres from the road.
She was born on her way to school.
It came to me a little earlier.
I was on my way to school.
I needed to go to the bathroom on the bus, and I was born there.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut through the dove's rope with the knives I was carrying to school," she described the defendant and said she was ashamed of being pregnant.
"The next day she returned to the place, put the child's body in the trunk and drove it away, took the body out of the trunk, packed it into a black needle and hid it and left her grandmother at home in Havlíčka's Broda," stands in the complaint that it is not quite obvious when the birth took place.
It could be within ten minutes, but also several hours after birth, suffocation when covered with blankets or when put under a blanket, cooling or bleeding from an unsweetened doll.
A similar scenario was repeated next year in spring.
A woman in the near undetected period from February to April 12 when the infant was found by random witnesses at a fish farm in Havlíčkobrodska, she gave birth in secret.
This time in the bathroom of the basement apartment in the family house.
Without checking whether she was born alive, without cutting off, and wearing a doll that was wrapped around her neck, she put the child into several plastic bags, including igelite bags, and left him in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon hours, he and his partner took him to the fishermen.
After all, she was a friend.
The father of both children was just a friend of the accused, who apparently didn't know about the pregnancy of the partner.
Even for this reason, he is not now before the court, only being punished for a crime against the funeral law.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like him being punished as a co-worker.
He manipulated my child against my will.
I know that my solution was not right, but it came to me at the time as a human," did not hide the slanderous, allegedly in relation to the man and feared him.
During her statement, a young woman spoke fairly straight.
The tears he shed in her eyes until the moment she spoke about her relationship with her parents, from whom she left after she reached adulthood.
She didn't want to kill.
"They follow me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she exclaimed.
I didn't use the equipment because I didn't want the kids, I looked young.
I wanted to put him in a baby box, but I don't know what happened that I didn't.
I can't explain that to you," the judge answered.
She refused, however, to act with the intelligence and intention of killing the newborn.
The second child was also born dead, according to her claim.
Even in pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
But I've narrowed it down.
And she didn't drink hard.
I also restricted smoking," she said.
Although pregnancy was seen in both cases, all of her repeated questions claimed that she had a health problem that she was pregnant.
And that's a friend.
The main examination will continue in the courthouse on Tuesday's statements of the judges.
On Wednesday, a verdict could be reached.
A woman is threatened with a criminal rate of up to 18 years in prison, possibly an exceptional punishment.

Pro-democratic activists in Hong Kong challenge the Chinese authorities on the day following the vote decision
Nearly a group of loyal people to Beijing, who had a Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress agreed on Sunday that only two of the three candidates were elected in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the support of the nomination committee, which is likely to consist of members of the faithful Beijing.
For the sake of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition democracies to get to the polls and allow pro-democratic activists to renew their promises and safeguard the financial centre of Hong Kong's protests of the "occupation of the Central".
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main reason for tension, Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democratisation will be extended to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report on the Chinese government in Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in the special official district and hundreds of thousands of people entered and occupied the city's trading district.
The press conference, attended by Prime Minister Li, is organised by the government in Hong Kong and by the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, the Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Committee of the Zhang Ronghsun and Deputy Director of the State Council of Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei also spoke at several press conferences.
Student activists declared that they were meeting in front of Hong Kong's government office this afternoon.
Until the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kyev to begin negotiations with eastern Ukraine on "state sovereignty"
According to a description of the events in Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the Ukrainian government to stop the struggles of separatists in the east of the country and to start immediately negotiations on the "state sovereignty" of the fragmented areas.
His spokesman Dmitrij Peskov later explained that Putin had no intention of suggesting that the eastern Ukrainian areas under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be overestimated so that the Russian speaking area would have the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's challenge to the Kyiv government to deal with the pro-russian rebellion as equals, is in line with a clear strategy, according to which it manages to break up the troubles five months ago: Help separatists to occupy the territory and make the Ukrainian government give the newly declared Novorus a real independence so that it can connect the place to the West with Russia.
In the conversation for the first state television channel Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions, which were to re-establish the eastern areas of Donecka and Luhansk, which ruled separatists in March and April after Moscow surveyed the Crimean peninsulas of Ukraine on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists recently occupied territories were named "Novorusko" or "New Russia", a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words, according to which "carriage illusions" everyone who believes that peace is in sight, because Ukrainian politicians launched a campaign in front of the October 26th parliamentary elections, while government units attack civilian population in the areas of controlled separatists.
"In the interests of the people living in these areas, we need to start meaningful negotiations immediately, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organisation of society and on the state sovereignty status of the southern Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's attack on state sovereignty was thought of in the context of a broader autonomy that Kyje's leadership has been conducting for several months and which is intended to alleviate the concerns of Russian speaking areas from the threat of cultural and language rights.
Peskov stated that the necessary autonomy can only be granted to the eastern region by the Ukrainian government.
It is not a matter of discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The progress of spokesperson Kreml, who was supposed to correct the "wrong interpretation" of Putin's notes, stressed the Russian leadership's approach to resolving the rise of separatists, which is different from the open siege of Crimea, where most of the two million people are from ethnic Russians.
Moscow should have much more difficulty investigating both Donéck and Luhansk in the east of Ukraine, as the majority of 6.5 million people are not Russians and public opinion polls, which have been carried out even before the conflict, have shown widespread support for the repression in Ukraine.
The autonomy of the Russian diplomats acting on international forums would give the regional government in Ukraine the power to determine its own trade agreements and international relations and thus essentially to give Kremla the actual control over the territory that would link the Russian fortress with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was surveyed five months ago, is the home of the main Russian maritime fleets, maritime trade grounds and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between the Russian Rostov and Crimea are also the center of the down, the factory and the sleigh, which make important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Porošenko, during his opening speech on 7 June, proposed that Ukrainian legislators - after new elections - consider changes in the constitution that would give various regions more control over their finances and language statutes.
But this vision of autonomy differs significantly from that of Kremlin and separatists. Moscow is accused of armaments and incitement of violence.
Putin's last call for Kyev to act as a separatist following the next rebel procedure last week after Russian troops and tanks from the former peaceful area along the Azov Sea penetrated eastern Ukraine.
The Russian separatists took control of Novoazovski so that the Ukrainian security authorities were afraid that it was a move to occupy the strategic coastal area until Crimea.
This accelerated the huge civil and military effort to secure Mariupol, a port with metalurgical combinations of 500 000 inhabitants lying between Novoazovsk and a narrow entrance gate on the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, a report appeared at a meeting of the leading representatives of the European Union in Brussels and called for an action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the last 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," warned Porošenko.
In the territory of Ukraine there are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks.
The EU summit has taken no final steps - leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the case of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters in Kyiv that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovakia after last week two columns of Russian armoured vehicles and 1,000 military units penetrated the Danube area to support armed separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers who were arrested in Ilovak during the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian exodus arrested a week ago in Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
In the scandal with exposed photos there are also Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disappointment at the hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancee Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after the biggest scandal with hacked photos of the celebrities got on the Internet a series of explicit photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker claims to have sixty photos with naked star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevenne, singer Rihanny, Ariany Grande and Ley Michell and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Because of the departure from iCloud, the public reportedly also received personal photos of Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko.
There's 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who asked for a hand last month, told the magazine Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information is given to steal and spread to the public.
Grecko, who is now in New York, reported online to the press that hacking is "unsatisfied" and those who have become his target are "suffering".
It's considered that hacker got thirty photos of Palmer with ex-Scott Speedman's friend, including two images on which he's not breaking up at the pool.
Palmer acted, for example, in the movie Love and honor, where her cousin Liam Hemsworth was.
Palmer, the TV star Chuck Strahovski and the actress from the thriller Sugar Punch Browning yesterday did not comment on stolen images.
The representative of Lawrence TMZ said: "It is a clear breach of privacy."
Herec Seth Rogen hacker on his Twitter criticised: "Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods."
From a legal point of view, the disclosure of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigmy footballers won the Lebra, without winning.
Olomouc - Chromies and lightnings that the collaborator of the Olomouc Sigma Josef Lébr sent to his subordinate last week are apparently past.
They brought only a point from Opava for a free line.
The establishment and fighting of the club boss have only a little bit of a good deal.
The payout money could come to the club soon.
"I'm leaving another fight, as I talked about last week, but I'm far more optimistic," Lebre confirmed, despite the fact that Sigma didn't win, her players convinced her with an improved performance.
The fighting and the deployment that we played mainly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In such a case, I am able to forgive that he does not win.
If we were to play this game from the beginning of the season, I believe we haven't lost yet," Lebr thinks.
Sigma in Opava stopped the initial pressure on the home, then the game was balanced and in the second half it was better.
After the victory, Kalvod’s faithful men fell, but they did not reach their goal, so they could not win.
The result, though, is not according to our imagination.
We lacked complete satisfaction, but only one changed chance," Lebr said, but he did not think that a change in the attitude of the football players was causing only his threat.
There must have been more aspects there.
Whether from my side, from the coach, or from the fans," said Lebr.
With pressure, Sigma has to count
The players did not want to comment much after the match in Opava last week.
I'm trying to get these things away.
I tried not to let it go," the young barrister Michal Reichl rubbed his head.
Then he left a question on Lebro's statement last week by attacker Václav Vasiček, who did not change the biggest opportunity Sigmy in the Saturday match.
After all, he was just talking about the pressure.
We're still under pressure.
Everyone wants to pull on us.
Today, we've shown that if we fight and drive everyone in the ass, it will go," he said.
Warnings came to the heart
Even Leoš Kalvoda’s viewer did not insist that the preparation for the match was not the easiest in view of the atmosphere that took place in Olomouci last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized, and today it was seen that Mr. Lebra's warning was taken to heart.
Even though it wasn't even about not wanting to fight and blow it off before," the Olympic coach said.
It was like today's first fifteen minutes.
It took us to compare ourselves to the fortress and to realize what the other lie is about.
It's not just about football, it's mainly about fighting," Calvoda said.
There's only hope that Sigma will work from the beginning in the next match.
"I would love to believe it," he added.
