Welsh Members do not wish to appear as ‘muppets’
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, known today as the AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal will result from the plans to change the name of the national assembly of the Wallisian Parliament.
Representatives from all over the political spectrum fear that this may lead to ridicule.
A representative from the Labour Party explained that his group was concerned because ‘it rhymes on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means "dustete", and pwp means "bäsj".
A representative of the Wales party Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was “discontented” and that they had proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Walysic part of the conservative party said that his group was ‘open’ for the name change, but noting that the MWP’s statement is very close to the word ‘Muppet’, which, in addition to being the name of some known dolls, is also a British word for ‘dist’.
In this context, the W wave letter is expressed in a similar way as the U letter is spoken in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like a "uh" sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: ‘Of course, it is the members who have the last right of destination in respect of which name they are to be mentioned.’
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation which showed general support for reintroducing the national assembly of the Wallisian Parliament.
With regard to the title of the representatives, the WMP (Welsh Parliament Members) was supported, but the MWP option was most supported during the public consultation.
The representatives propose a number of other alternatives, but getting all parties to reach an agreement could lead to the heads of the parliamentary chair, Elin Jones, who will, according to the plan, deliver a legislative draft for the amendment of the name in the next few weeks.
The legislation on the reform will include other changes in the functioning of the national assembly, including rules on disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the last right to vote on what they should be called when they are discussing the law.
Macedonians go to the elections to decide whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia can vote on whether their name should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a decade-long dispute with the neighboring country of Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a requirement in their territory and has, on several occasions, opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
People's voters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is quite simply the price they have to pay to get involved in the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's silence – the cracks in Harlem slips
"The old ones I spoke to have told me that before this time there was a bar and a church on each corner," says Adams.
«Now there is none of the parts.»
He said the bartender's departure was understandable.
“People are socializing in other ways” to date, he says.
‘Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local environment, which all visit regularly.’
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders believe. «And before or after they are back at the beginning».
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment building full of the kind of people who won't help the rest of the neighborhood.
‘Most of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,’ he says, ‘and will therefore only speed up the day when these churches must close the doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.’
Both screams were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Group moved out in the 1930s.
A black crowd who had remained nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's received a black crowd under priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of traders on 125th Street – one of Harlem's main advocates – because they refused to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 caused great damage to the building, and when Johnson’s son-in-law made plans for the reconstruction, they bought a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, proudly declared that the carillon was "the church bells of poor people".
The expert who played the cartoon in July called it something else: «a cultural tax» and «an irreplaceable historical instrument».
The expert, Tiffany Ng from University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's in the last few months is a complex interaction between architects and contractors, some of which have been initiated by the church's parliament and others by the Bishop.
The Council of the Church – the Head of the Community, consisting of legislators – wrote to the Bishop in July of its concern that the Bishop came to ‘try to impose the costs’ on the Council of the Church, despite the fact that the Council of the Church had not been involved in the induction of the architects or contractors sent by the Bishop.
Some sorority children complained of lack of transparency on the part of the Bishop.
Hai damages 13-year-olds on lobster in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he went after lobsters in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends in about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help, and that he and a group of others swam to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel he first thought that the boy cried out with enthusiasm about having caught a lobster, but he realized afterwards that the boy called 'I was bited!
I was bitten!'»
His whole neck was torn up," says Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
"I called out that everyone had to get out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'," said Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is not known.
Bathrobe Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles also said that the victim suffered serious injuries in the upper torso.
The authorities closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
Giles noticed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make its way into the UK's beauty care market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with a store-like makeup and beauty care Allah, the staff of specially trained employees.
The extended shelves are tested out in 11 shops around the country as part of a strong intake in the UK's 2.8 million beauty care market, which is still growing while the sales figures for clothing and household items fall. If the attempt turns out to be successful, the concept will be extended to several shops next year.
The investment in beauty care is a result of the efforts of the supermarket to find a new area of use for the space previously used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's said they should double the number of beauty care products they offer to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the store chain has never sold before.
Existing product selections from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also get a better place in marked areas, in the same way as in shops like Boots.
The Supermarket Chain also relaunchs its Boutique retail brand with mainly vegan products, as demand for this is growing among younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop will test out the sales table in two Sainsbury's shops. One opened in Croydon in South London last week, while the other opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Net trade and a new tendency to buy small quantities of food daily from local day-care shops means that supermarkets need to do more to allow customers to arrive.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's said that the auctions are going to look more and more like a product store, as the supermarket takes up the fight against the Aldi and Lidl cheap stores with several services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of shops, and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales after buying both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempts by the supermarket to upgrade the beauty and pharmacy departments were unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots early in the 2000s, but the cooperation was terminated after an alarming distribution of the apothecaries' income in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 store portfolios to Celesio, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury leather pins, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Salesbury's trade director, said: "We have transformed the look and design of the beauty care centers to create more inviting environments for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who will be so prepared to give advice and help.
Our brand selection is designed to cover all needs, and the inviting environments and practical locations make us a beauty competition that represents a new business experience.»
Peter Jones is "racing" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement worth GBP 11 million
Dragons' The Star Peter Jones must certainly be angry after the TV-host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessories, True.
Their company was previously compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37) who is the programmer in this Morning announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' The Star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand in the last seconds to focus on their own new gold-making contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Source says that Jones was "racing" at a busy meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here that the yellow of the TV admitted that her new contracts – worth up to GBP 1.5 million – mean that she no longer has time to skip to their clothes and accessories brand, True.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby's estimated assets of GBP 11 million.
At the same time as Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she was going to leave True, she left Jones the United Kingdom on her way to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security over the next ten years.
Everyone's totally shocked that she's chosen to move.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was right before the launch.
Now a warehouse full of goods at Marlow's headquarters is ready for sale.»
Experts believe that this Morning programmer, who is among the most popular stars in the United Kingdom, may cost the company several million pounds due to major investment in products such as butter and light, mote and coscler, as well as a potential delay in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby created True with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became the board member in March.
The two couples travel together, and Jones has 40% ownership of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall become M&S branding ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host to the ITV programme I'm A Celebrity.
A source standing near Jones said yesterday, "We will not comment on his business affairs".
Chefs "and then we fell in love"
He was aware of the criticism he would receive from the news media in order to have come with a comment some would consider to be 'a bit presidential' and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given away so much?
said Trump in his imitation of a novelist.
«I have not given away anything.»
He noted that Kim was interested in a new meeting, after having declared himself that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a major piece of shit on the way to the nuclear suppression of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear destruction have stopped.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not seen a "correspondence" from the United States of America on its early disarmament measures.
He noted that, instead, the United States still has sanctions designed to keep the press up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke of a meeting of his electors.
"We do very well with North Korea," he said.
"We kept going to war against North Korea.
Many millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a competitive relationship."
He said his work to improve Kim's relationship has given positive results, such as putting a stop to rockets, helping to get rid of hostages and getting the lives of American service people sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about Kim's relationship.
"It's easy to act with presidentship, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this progressive arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the area right in front of us.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia breed an island and kill hundreds of people
In the cold water of the Lombok earthquake, non-resident ideal organisations were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 % of the inhabitants of Lombardy had lost their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a requirement for international aid to be submitted.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it quite clear that they do not ask for international aid, so it is quite challenging," said Sumbung.
The children are now putting together a team to travel to Palu, but are not yet sure if foreign workers will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the national crisis management stage, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu in order to see whether international organisations should be allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Given the constant exposure of Indonesia to earthquakes, the country is extremely poorly prepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
Light to protect against tsunamis is built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning acid in Palu, although a warning had been sent out, has probably contributed to the death figures.
Even in the best of circumstances, it is a challenge to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to deal with earthquakes is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrade of Indonesia's fake infrastructure to a key point in his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of money has been a major problem for the Yoko administration, which will be re-election next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have gone into a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes when Christians and Muslims reproduce locks in the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge with late compensation in the fight against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League losing against Chelsea on Saturday by cutting for 89 minutes at the Battle of Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a fit from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from the Chelsea target while making his bed 1-0 back.
He moved the ball to the left foot before he sent it to the longest corner.
The attempt went high over the box, with the ball falling at the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally went over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and crashed into the net.
“I just tried to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as well as it’s possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and hit the ball once and didn’t think too much about it and just kick it further.”
Chelsea led by 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a target for 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent a fit with the helmet back to Mateo Kovacic, before he changed direction near the center and sprinted into the Liverpool track half.

The deaths following Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami have increased to 832, notified the country's crisis management headquarters early Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a 7.5 strike that hit the country on Friday and caused a wave of up to six meters, the state’s speaker, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, explained at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from raided buildings.
Police arrest man (32) for murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A killer investigation was initiated after the corpse of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street. A 32-year-old man was attacked, suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything about contact.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: "We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I will ask everyone in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and see or hear anything suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask all, in particular the Drove Commander, who may have caught something on his car camera, to contact them – they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the dead woman was a permanent resident in Birkenhead, and that she was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said they are working to inform the victim.
A droid driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been informed that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was aimless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take several hours before they get back in.
A police officer was interrogated, telling a man that the whole area is now being treated as a resort.
A crying woman appeared at the station.
She repeats "it's so horrible" over and over again.
At 14 a.m., two police cars behind the lockdown, while a third a car was outside.
A number of police officers stood outside the lockdown and had oversight of the apartment complex.
Persons who have information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 by referring to ‘log 247’ from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last monument to be included in the "rewrite history" cry.
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious taxes, which was carried out by his fanatic Puritan adherents.
But the history team Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick's edition as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, says: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace also became a target.
The iconoclass of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his forefather Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing production of Cromwell is a proof of the 1800s' opinions and is part of the history of a man many still deserve to be praised.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell becomes of many, perhaps more late in the 1800s than today, as Parliament defends against the outside press – in his day it was of course the monarchy.
If this is a completely accurate representation, it is still the subject of a historic debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His performance as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering.»
Drasgris takes life from Chinese bondage
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on his market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
The man, mentioned only after the name ‘Yuan’, was found dead and covered with blood from a broken pulse year near a bond on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig bunny prepares to place vaccines on pigs on a farm in the town of Xining, Qinghai province of China on 30 May 2005.
He had decided to travel with his aunt from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The morning after the fatten found him dead, and discovered that the port of a nearby pigpath was open.
He said that inside the pig's womb, it was a big hole with blood on his mouth.
A medical examination confirmed, according to the report, that the 250 kg pig had killed the man.
«Beine to my fat was bloody and ill-treated» explained the fat, referred to aftername Wu, in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
Recording from surveillance cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His likeness was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his aunt.
While the police collectively testifying from the station, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked in to prevent it from attacking someone else.
The Yuan family and market management negotiate certain fees for compensation for the death.
Although this is the case, it is not the first time it has been recorded that a pig has attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on a farm in Massachusetts, and caused serious damage to the man.
Ten years ago, a Walysian peasant was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a pig of 300 kg until the farmer's wife was able to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News explained that pigs are not aggressive to the usual, but that the taste of blood can have an explosive effect.
«From the heart.
They like to bite, and they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt anyone.
You only have to show sufficient respect.’
The rest of the hurricane Rosa will lead to severe rain in the southwestern United States
As reported, hurricane Rosa is weakened by moving across the cooler sea on the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will lead the river rain on her journey through North Mexico and South-West USA over the next few days.
Rosa had a wind strength of 135 km/h and was a hurricane of category 1 at 05.00 ET on Sunday, and was located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a path begins to be formed across the Pacific and moves east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical humidity north toward the Southwest USA.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Afterwards, the cooperation between tropical humidity and the drought that is approaching will lead to widespread heavy rain in the south-west in the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous floods, liquid rain and rapid and possible earthquakes in the desert.
Tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates of up to 5-7 cm per hour in some areas, in particular areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5-10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the south-west country, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are possibilities for fluxes with rapid deterioration due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around in the desert to foot as long as there is a danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can lead to esophageals becoming wide-winding rivers, and the soil will lead to local windfalls that may contain dust and sand.
The approach will lead to local strong rainforests for parts of the coast along the South-California.
Total rainfall of more than 1,3 cm is possible and this can lead to liquid noise and speed, as well as smooth roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the area.
Some scattered tropical rainforests will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and continue throughout Wednesday.
October may cause some intense temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic becomes colder but the troops are very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We're going to see a clear example of strong temperature differences across the whole Central USA on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, sustained summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the Central and Eastern USA will probably get a warm start in October, with degrees high on the 20th from Southern Plains to parts of the North-East USA.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate report indicates that the East-US is most likely to have temperatures higher than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw at Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, distributed on six TV networks, saw Thursday's arresting testimony from the highest-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that was to take place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political campaign continued, and broadcasters interrupted their usual missions to announce Friday's great surprise in the last seconds, when it was found that the Senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged it so that the FBI would conduct a weekly investigation of the charges.
Before told the Senate court committee that she was 100% sure that a drunk Kavanaugh felt her and tried to take her clothes off at a youth school.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100% certain that this did not happen.
The shipment on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average viewers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The viewer number was not immediately available for other networks that showed the consultation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, the Nielsen tends to have problems measuring offices.
To give a little perspective, this number is equal to the final game of American football championships or Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose opinions have supported Kavanaugh's appointment with great enthusiasm, led to networks, with an average viewer of 5.69 million for the whole day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was the main person for Friday's drama.
The office of the moderate Republican came with an opinion that he came to vote in favor of Kavanaugh. On Friday morning he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the lift to a meeting in the court panel while protestors shouted and shouted at him.
He stood with his eyes down for several minutes while he was kicked out, while the event was sent directly to the CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he is telling us the truth?"
He was told that “you have power when so many women are powerless”.
Flake pointed out that his office had come with an opinion and said that the elevator doors had closed that he had come to have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the hearing directly several hours later, as the Court Committee would vote on whether to continue the nomination of Kavanaugh to the entire Senate for reconciliation.
But Flake said he was only willing to do this if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate within the next week, which the democratic minority has called for.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flakes' election had a great impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of "political game" around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused the opponents of her plan to leave the EU to play "political games" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermine the nation's interests.
UK Minister of State Theresa May arrives Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, the press on the side of her own on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson has continued his attack on her so-called 'Chequers' plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal that the UK and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was 'very ridiculous'.
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police attack Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing the LSU player's death
Police have attacked a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) is arrested and targeted for deliberate murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police Sims lost his glasses during the Basket.
The police found the glasses at the station and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he consented to have shot and killed Wayde.
His bail is set to USD 350 000, according to The Lawyers.
The medical officer in East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, indicating the cause of death as a blow-off year in the head and through the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police for its working group on the acquisition of refugees, the State Police Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the local population for their contribution to the research that led to an attack.
LSU’s sport leader Joe Alleva thanks to the police force of the area for its ‘hard work and pursuit of justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
Friday morning LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "knout" and "in shock" after Wayne's death.
"This is what we fear at all times," said Wade.
Volcano syringe ash over Mexico by
The ash that sprays out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost neighbours in Mexico’s capital.
Centro Nacional de Preventción de Disasters, Mexico’s public crisis prevention platform, warned the population of Mexico on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after the activity increased in the crackdown and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were recorded during one day.
The State monitored several cases of bullying and shaking.
Photos on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering windscreens on cars in neighboring areas such as Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km south-east of the capital after an earthquake of 7.1 in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conjunction with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after the independence protestants had a connection with the police, while several thousand participated in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote on release.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the rebel police, and bombed them with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Handles also broke out later on the day, when the police used batons to limit the fights.
For several hours, independent demonstrators and called «Never forget, never forgive» stood face to face with Unionist demonstrators called «Long live Spain».
Forty people were treated for minor damage received during the protests, according to the local press.
The tension remains high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the public vote on 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but the celebration of separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming majority for release, but it was not enough because the vote was boycotted by most who opposed the release.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after the police tried to stop the vote taken at polling stations across the region.
Release groups strike in the streets by Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration was held, however, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes of Catalonia's ability to become independent.
"We had one of our best moments last year.
I saw my parents crying for joy of getting a vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have had problems keeping pressure up this year, after many of their well-known leaders have been travelling in self-indicted exile or are in custody while awaiting legal proceedings for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protests to support the police, said that the conflict was issued by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is becoming more and more tense," he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been incarcerated in waiting for a trial since late in the fourth year, announced that he will be elected in the European Parliament next year.
"To stand up for election as a candidate in the European elections is the best I can do to condemn the oppression and reprehensibility of democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving a car into a house wall
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after driving a car several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the port and the building itself.
An armrest may also have been fired against the car at a time.
Mengas attack leads to Livingston 1-0 wins against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured sailor
The famous Livinston surprised Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second losses after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
A good encounter from Dolly Menga proved to be decisive, and Gary Holt's side is now equal to the Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's side has still not won on the way to the Premier League this season and is to play against the Heads of Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers will play home fight against Rapid Vienna in Europe on Thursday.
Livingston, on his side, has kept out of line through six fights in the division. Master Holt has not yet lost a fight since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunities for his slaves
Holt's law should have led long before they scored, as their direct procedure caused countless problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but the bomb at the target, and Alan Lithgow could only send the sprayed forward after climbing in to meet Craig Halkett's head over the target.
The company Lot Rangers played ahead, well aware that they could create problems for their guests at death ball.
And that's how the decisive goal came to be.
Rangers gave away a fresh park and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga a clear path, and he scored a target from the middle of the box.
By this stage, Rangers had seen the ball very much all the time, but the housekeeper's defence had turned out to be immeasurable and targeted Liam Kelly had a bit to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos performed a nearby score that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of the Rangers Keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston death ball in a short watch.
Chrysions still came into the Livingston box and were still saved, while two criminal demands – once after Halket's protest against the Interchanger Glenn Middleton, and once for hand – were translated.
‘Penomenal’ from Livingstone – analysis
BBC Scotlands Alaskar Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingstone.
They were all fantastic together, and they continue to pass all expectations on the way up.
The style of the game and the humanity have barely changed since they came to the top again, but Holt must have much of the honour for the way he has strengthened on after his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was amazing and coordinated an enormously well-organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on tach aves throughout the fight.
Rangers, on the other hand, didn't have my inspiration to sign with.
Although they have sometimes been very good under Gerrard, they failed to live up to this standard.
The last part of the fight was labs – they only entered the home track half once – and there was a little bit of a pick-up for Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just a smile and blue sky on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate lunch together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between NATO allies.
There has been a division of matters such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police reported security as the reason that a population of 25 000 was not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters met in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan – many of them the Kurds – also heard from themselves, criticizing both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to let him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the split that follows a man who is praised as a whole of some German Turks and is hated as an autocrat of others.
Deptford collision: Cyclists killed in collision with car
A cyclist is killed in a collision like a passenger car in London.
The collision took place in the intersection between Bestwod Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy road in Deptford southeastern town, about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died on the spot.
The collision takes place only one month after a cyclist died in a ride where the driver escaped from the Children's Street station, about a mile from the slave's collision.
Metropolitan Police said the police are working to identify the man and alert the victims.
Roadblocks and buses are in place, and drivers are the Council to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six servants injured in hostages
Six prison officers have been injured in an incident in a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
Breaks broken out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday, and is still going on.
Specialized ‘Tornado’ officers are picked up to handle the event, involving eight inmates and limited to one fly.
Officials were treated for minor facial damage on site.
One Prison Service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been sent in to handle an ongoing event at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – the responsible will be transferred to the police, and may have to spend even more time behind lockdown and beating.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October yesterday, the rebel police were called up to deal with a serious incident in which the employees were attacked with billiards.
Orkanen Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with river (can be favourable for drought areas)
It is the shield Arizona is hit by a tropical low pressure, but it will probably happen early next week, as the remaining power of the hurricane Rosa moves through the deserts of the south-west and leads with its fleet.
National Weather Service has already issued fleet warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rainstorm will begin late Monday night.
National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that only "Ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status as a tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the border to Arizona.’
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5–10 cm of precipitation, with up to 15 cm of individual spots in the Mongollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas within the south-west desert, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin mountain range, will likely reach between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of rainfall is possible in some areas.
For those outside the flock, Rosa may be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flow is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be favorable, since the South West is currently in a drought state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, a little over 40 percent of Arizona is at least extreme dry, which is the next highest category, according to weather.com.
First, the hurricane hits Rosa land at the Mexican peninsula Baja California.
Rosa still has the energy strength Sunday morning, with a maximum wind strength of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves 19 km/h.
The storm meets cold water in the Pacific, and it loses its power.
Therefore, it is expected to meet Mexico with tropical storms Monday night or afternoon.
The rainfall over parts of Mexico may be strong and lead to great fluctuations.
«Total rainfall of 7,5–15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a capacity of up to 25 cm rainfall, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm until it reaches the border of Arizona Gritly Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which then moves further through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
‘The main risk expected by Rosa or the rest of it is very severe rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert in the United States’, according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce life-threatening floods and floating noises and rapids in the desert and earthquakes in mountain areas.

Trump says that Kavanaugh has "difficulty and mind" to the democratic party
"A voice to support Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the thoughtless and shocking tactics of the democratic party," Trump said in front of a People's Meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been "a member of the minority and the mind" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of the Congress on Thursday, and denied strongly and emotionally charged by Christine Blasey Ford that he had committed a sexual assault against her several decades ago, as they were teenagers.
Ford is also testifying to his charge during the hearing.
On Saturday, the President said that "the American people saw how brilliant, good and courageous" was that day.
"A voice to support Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to support one of the most powerful lawyers of our time, with free public service pay," he told a meeting of his supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred discreetly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of the Republicans' voting in the inter-elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant," he said.
"That's why I travel around and fight for the best candidates."
Trump claimed that the democratics have the objective of "resisting and preventing".
The Senate's first intermediate vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place on Friday, according to the assistant to a leader of the Republican Party told CNN.
Several hundred deaths of Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis, the numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed, and many were taken out to sea by huge waves that turned against the beaches when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slavesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high wave in the country around the sunset, ravaged everything in its path and led many into the drowning death.
The Tsunami came in the hills on an earthquake with a force of 7.5.
‘When the tsunami occurred yesterday, people were still running with activities on the beach, did not immediately escape and ended up as victims,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for Indonesia’s crisis management table (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
«Tsunami was not alone – it drove with it cars, trunks and houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Someone climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived.»
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the crisis management seat showed many ruined buildings and shops, distorted and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
After the earthquake, the coastal town continued to rise on Saturday.
The number of Earthquakes could be recognized by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's state of assessment and use of technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the force from the huge earthquake of Friday was about 200 times more than the power in the atomic bomb that was released over Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow arc may have made the tsunami larger, according to the state.
Nugroho described the damage as “inclusive” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the fatalities and damage could be the larger coast of the country 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is close to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication ‘was completely distorted, completely without information’ from Dongala, according to Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," said Red Cross in a press release, and let their staff and volunteers be on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
On Saturday it was strongly criticised for not being informed that a tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media, a man at the top floor of a building called desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passersby on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water drenching towards the beach, with its buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to authenticate the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a major power failure that has prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The military has begun to send transport flights using Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuations still have desperate needs for food and other needs.
The city’s airport is open only for auxiliary work, and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The mortality rates after tsunami in Indonesia rise above 800.
That's awful.
World Vision staff from Dongala have arrived safely at the Palu center, where they have sought shelter during the presentation number at the farm in front of their office, but the major damage happened on the way, according to Doseba Sinay.
"They told me they saw hundreds of ruined houses," he said.
That's awful.
In the wake of the auxiliaries, the desperate preparations for crisis relief began, some complained that foreign auxiliaries with much expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis zone until it has been declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'Greece, this is a national disaster', we can open the limits of international aid, but the situation has not yet received any status."
That the sun goes down above Palu for the second time after Friday's earthquake and tsunamis hope friends and family of those who are still missing that their love should be among the miraculous stories that illuminate the dark news image after tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was caught by a bell.
On Sunday a woman was rescued by rescue teams after spending two days trapped in ruins with her mother's corpse next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the national paragliding team, had thirty-two of the missing paragliders for the Asians, which was carried out earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those who were caught in the ruins of Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
"As a paragliding senior, I have my own emotional need to carry," he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the practitioners who participated in the beach festival at Palu.
But the messages led only to grey hook marks, or a couple of blue hook marks.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Tyver steals USD 26 750 during minibank refill in Newport on the Livee
On Friday morning, the thief stole USD 26 750 from a Brink's worker who filled a minibank in Newport on the Livee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a minibank in the entertainment complex and got ready to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.

Everyone who has information about their identity must contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes its name – to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The creation was formerly known as Kanye West."
West (41) had named Ye over a long time, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was launched in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the program, after she cancels on "emotional basis", according to the serial creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, when he discussed the album title with the big boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a representation of who we are."
He's one of many known rappers who's changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, which has previously collaborated with the West, has also varied between the use of tapes and large letters.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's President-in-Office, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sworn that he will never use military power against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he "never will ever use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Military troops marched against a peaceful demonstration at the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements broke across Latin America.
Lopez Obador has promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening up more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminal reproductions.
USA should double financial support for artificial intelligence
After each China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the USA should double the amount they use in research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, the investor and perform of artificial intelligence, which has the job for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have come with notices of artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the United States generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, on its part, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number 1 in innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough," Lee said.
Double financial support can double the chance of the next great performance of artificial intelligence coming from the United States," Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence as the U.S. best Othello player, and later he was a leader at Microsoft Research or director of Google's Chinese Department.
Lee recognized the American government's previous technological competitions, such as Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next will be held, to help find the next generation clock heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive state funding, according to Lee.
"It's not China that steals the academic leaders, it's companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed smart heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
"I believe that those who have a doctorate in artificial intelligence should receive offers of residence permit automatically," he said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the development of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation is funding people from academic institutions, in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are distributing money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Defence Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the US legislation aimed at establishing a national security commission for artificial intelligence has been suspended for several months.
Macedonians vote in public vote on whether the name of the country should be changed
The people of Macedonia voted in a public vote Sunday on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia in order to resolve a ten-year dispute with Hellas, which has blocked their attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a requirement in Greek territory and has voiced its concern about including them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the public vote, and a boycotting campaign has raised doubts about the meeting will meet the minimum requirement of 50 per cent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question of the vote is: ‘Are you for NATO and EU membership in the approval of the agreement with Greece?’.
Those who support the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that arose after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be eligible for membership in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the EU's protective umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it will probably be crucial because a large number of Members have said they will respect the outcome of the vote.
The amendment of the name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said they had not received any irregularity reports by 13 a.m.
However, the meeting was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
"I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about to change the country's name to open the doors so that they can become members of NATO and the EU.
Before the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) made clear a small scene and pulled out chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the vote.
"We are positive for NATO and the EU, but we will be notified with a high head, not to be thrown in the back," Kavadarkov says.
"We are a poor country, but we have our merit.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can return to countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Minister of State Zaev said NATO membership would lead to a vulnerable investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I think most of them will be for, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to become members of the EU and NATO," Zaev says after voting.
He says that a "yes" answer will be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a poll issued last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 per cent of eligible participants will participate in the public vote – this is lower than the required meeting.
Another study, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of black people have plans to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they came to vote yes.
In order for the public vote to be valid, the meeting must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the public vote fails, it will constitute the first serious political obstacle the pro-Western government has supported since it took over in May last year.
See: Manchester Cities Sergio Aguero maneuvers across the entire Brighton defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defense in Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero got it to look ridiculously light as he scored a target in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a fit at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran about fighting with three Brighton defenders before he got out on the open track.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shorts.
He came around one defender before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a passport to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used the right shoe to hit Brighton's Keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right-hand side of the net.
"Aguero still wears some leg problems," City Manager Pep Guardiola told the press.
“We talked about he came to play 55–60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky he scored a target right then."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage of the Premier League struggle.
This target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball placed on Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful passage through the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a few contacts before he led Sterling towards the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net right before it was over the death line.
City plays against Hoppenheim in the Champions League group game at 12.55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be the spoiler for Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and there is no reason to be so strong.
However, the always equal competition-setting Scherzer hopes to stand on the path on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playing opportunities of the Colorado team, which leads over Los Angeles Dodgers with one battle in NL West.
Rockies got a wild card slot with a 5–2 win over the National Friday night, but is still out to secure their first division title.
Although we have nothing to gain, we can at least play with the knowledge that the vote here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be the most likely to become the highest level of battle I'm going to be playing on this year.
Why would I not participate in it?"
The Nationals have still not announced their starting pitcher for Sunday, but must certainly be inclined to take Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting pitcher for 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and would throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-hand Washington player has won 18 matches this season and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 rounds.
Trump's People's Assembly in West Virginia
The president referred discreetly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh's highest-ranking position while discussing the importance of the Republicans' voting in the inter-elections.
"Everything we have done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant. That's why I travel around and fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued "You see this cruel, cruel group of radical Democrats, you see it just now.
And they're determined to take power back at any price.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have the objective of "opposing and preventing".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "sin and evil and wicked and dishonest".
He referred to the Senate's judicial committee and referred to the democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, on which the public was adjourned.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you played the document?
Um, um, wow.
No, um, no, I'm waiting for one – it was very bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer open to all.
They don't tolerate people who say their opinion
When Momentum activists in the local party voted to censor me, it was almost a surprise.
I am, after all, the last of a number of Labour Members who have been informed that we are not welcome, just because we say what we mean.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was supposed to be censored because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of having responsible economic policies, national security, Europe – ironically enough similar things that the Jeremys disagreeed with previous leaders.
At the meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday it was stated that ‘we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive’.
In most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been exactly this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the vote at many of the meetings, and the promise that 'more flexible, more friendly' policies will be too long forgotten if it actually started.
It becomes increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the Labour Party, and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the management of the Party.
This began shortly after Jeremy was led, when fellow Members previously thought that I shared many political positions with a sudden beginning to expect me to take a U-swing and stand by what I had never agreed on before, either the security of the nation or the EU's internal market.
When I speak publicly – and there is nothing to say what I say – I receive a lot of bad messages on social media that requires me to be dismissed, condemn central politics and tell me that I should not be in Labour.
And it's not just me who's experienced this.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet a sea that gender-discriminatory and racist comments every day, but never allow themselves to wander.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross disparity has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a tolerance culture.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to everyone, and every mistrust proposal and every change in the election groups is getting smaller.
I have received a lot of advice over the last two years, where I am invited to keep my head low and not raise my voice so much, because it will “do everything better”.
But that was not why I was involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government that had led to my classroom in the public school I attended being literally finished, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as local councillor and government minister.
I have never concealed my political opinions, nor in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East can have in any way misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current management.
To those who put forward the representative's proposal on Friday, I would simply say that, because the country races our way towards a Brexit that will harm private individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot grasp and understand the desire to waste time and force on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum – it is to those I represent, whether they are Labour Members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of resignation or political compromise will prevent me from doing what I think best to safeguard their interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbelieved Ayr rises to tops
Two late attempts have changed the final result a little, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this fantastic entertaining Tennant's Premiership campaign.
They're now at the top of the table, and they're the only unscrupulous of the ten.
Finally, it was as much their controversial defence as their ability to use the opportunities they had given to the homecoming off with the sailor, and coaches Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
"We have been challenged in our fights so far, and we are still undernourished, so I must be pleased with that," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "All the honor to Ayr, they were better at using the possibilities than we were."
Grant Anderson's trial for 14 minutes, with a target park from Frazier Climo gave Ayr management, but a yellow card to Scotlandn Lady Rory Hughes, borrowed from Warriors, lot Melrose leveled the position, and Jason Baggot performed a test without a target park.
Climo strengthened Ayr's leadership with a criminal park before he, just before the break, scored and target park a solo attempt to change the position to 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose started the second half hard, and Patrick Anderson's attempts, with a target park from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Then there was a longer stay in connection with a serious damage to Ruarid Knott, which was worn out on the bar, and from the relaunch, Ayr's management increased even more in an attempt by Stafford McDowell, with a target park from Climo.
Ayr's working captain, Blain Macpherson, then got a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of it to have an extra man on the path to the full with a trial from Bruce Colvine without a target park, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the housekeeper came back strongly, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to have covered Climo when he had not had the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown at the input behind the exhaling Ayr mill.
Climo performed a target park, as he did again almost completely from the relaunch, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's boxing park and sent flange Gregor Henry off for the fifth attempt of the site.
Still the Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that the Still Game star Ford Kieran is on its way into the service industry – it was recently discovered that he was named as the director of a restaurant company with a gift permit.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays on the popular BBC program, for which he writes manuals and plays together with his long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
Duen has announced that the next nine seasons will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is now planning life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the Director of the Adrift Morn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "living restaurant industry".
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, a country without a coast line, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Seamen patrol a riggin deck of the main marine quarters of La Paz.
Public buildings lift a blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicacas to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
The entire internal state of Bolivia has still fresh in mind the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict of the 1800s, and the country extends once again to sail on the Pacific.
These hopes may be greater than they have been for decades, awaiting a knowledge from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has a driving force, a Community spirit and a calm mind, and of course awaits the outcome with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the knowledge of the International Court of Justice on large screens in many different places in the country, hoping that the Hague Court will give its knowledge in favour of Bolivia's claim that Chile – after several decades of sporadic negotiations – is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia its own exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatically native president of Bolivia – facing a controversial re-election campaign next year – has also put a lot of emphasis on Monday's knowledge.
"We are very close to a return to the Pacific," he promised late in August.
But some analysts believe that the court will soon take Bolivia's party, and that very little would change if it had done so.
The United Nations body, which was held in the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to leave Chilean territories and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The knowledge of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the last arguments have been heard suggesting that the case ‘was not complicated’, according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than promoting Bolivia's stuff, the last four years can actually have done things worse.
‘The problem of access to the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian administration’, said Zárate.
She believes that Morale's antagonistic rhetoric has wiped out any remaining charity on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court's decision came in an unusually rapid manner.
According to him, Monday will give Bolivia ‘an extraordinary opportunity to open a new generation relationship with Chile’ and the possibility to ‘stop for 139 years of disagreement, for the benefit of both parties’.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – has used the maritime situation as a political shield.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
«The knowledge is a reason to see what we need to do to overcome the past.»
North Korea says nuclear destruction will not happen unless they can rely on the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never break its nuclear weapons if they cannot trust US authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to comply with the pledges made during a meeting between the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to launch the fixed atom diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a ‘ wishful dream’ that continued sanctions and American resistance to the Korean War will sometimes force North Korea into knees.
The US authorities are skeptical about accepting the statement without first implementing significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, president of the United States, want another meeting.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really has plans to give up on an arsenal country probably looks like the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo has plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the last in huge headgear, which is on its way to a clothing store near you
If you want any big additions to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you don't need to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne picked up a selection of rare, oversized headgear as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the motels on the motel in Paris.
Very impractical haters have been popular at Instagram in the summer, and these designers have sent out their stunning creations down the catwalk.
Valentino's most spectacular blow was an exaggerated beige had painted with a spring-like wide brake like drowned models' heads.
Other super-dimensional accessories included jeweled watermelons, a trolley hat or even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also picked up a selection of berth masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had repeated lips and similar more on Hannibal Lecter than the last scream.
One creation the memory of dive equipment, including snorkel and dive glasses, while another looked like a molten ice cream in the kitchen.
And if you're out for even bigger coin accessories, then you're lucky.
Styleksperter predicts that the huge hats can be on their way to a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come right into the heels of ‘La Bomba’, the straw hat with a half-metre-wide brake that has been seen on all and every one, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult mark behind the very impractical hat as the dominant social media has now sent yet another great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw which is almost as big as the swimwear model carrying it.
The orange refinery, which is bordered with refinery and complemented with a white skin handle, was the most striking creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Moteuka in Paris.
Kendisstylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach towels in the clothing shops next summer – when the designer has had such an impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for super-dimensional accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial to world citizens
Scotland's fresh schools are still showing academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with some one year's excellent exam results. These are supported by individual and common success in sports, art, music and other social measures.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (the Scottish Schools Council), have over 30,000 students across Scotland, and work hard to deliver the best school experience to both students and parents.
Schools are designed to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational body that can design and implement a tailor-made school budget, we see that modern languages are still a popular and sought-after choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands when his head sounds.
If you speak with him in your own language, his heart shall speak."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot just hold on to English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of the year's exam, we see that the language is at the top of the table with the highest percentages of attendance from fresh schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the study character A.
The data obtained from 74 college members of the Free School Council showed that 72 percent of students received the A in mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that fresh schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill for children and young people who are more likely to need in the future.
Languages as professionals are now valued at the same level as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics on board for fresh schools and other places.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for the reasons of employers, 17 per cent of the problem of job vacancies could be attributed to lack of language skills.
That is why language skills are becoming increasingly important in order to prepare young people for a future career.
Each time more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills are crucial in a globalised world.
If you have learned another language, these lifelong skills will give real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
To communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey answered by more than 4000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and in French the only language was a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investment in language training is now crucial for today’s children.
More languages, in particular those linked to emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, if each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach in the languages that are considered the most valuable for the United Kingdom on the road to 2020, e.g. mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what interests your child, there will always be a selection of languages to choose between in fresh schools, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scottish fresh schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today's global business environment that language is still crucial to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
Modern languages should in fact be regarded as ‘international communication capacity’.
Fresh schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and distinction for Scotland's youth.
It needs to be done well.

LeBron will have his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James playing for Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the Sunday morning's opening match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he should play is still not finished.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After a practice earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' six-game lead song plan.
"I don't need leadership at this stage of my career," he answered.
Time for Trump's public meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President starts a number of election meetings tonight, Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five planned public meetings over the next week, including stops in cities where he has much support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his elected Supreme Court candidate has been put to the fore, Trump has the objective of obtaining support for the forthcoming elections, since the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the congress when the voters go to the polls in November.
When is Trump's West Virginia public meeting tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's People's Meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to start at 19.00 a.m. tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's public meeting in West Virginia on the network below via direct flow on YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss the week's hearings for the highest-ranking Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault.
The main objective of all these meetings is to support Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that during the next few weeks, these five public meetings are intended to “fill volunteers and support players as the Republicans try to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives”, according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are moving towards a campaign season," Reuters heard from a campaign leader for Trump who did not want to be named.
The evening's public meeting, which is scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, may attract supporters from ‘Ohio and Pennsylvania, and be covered by the Pittsburgh press’, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time during the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, a country he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican latent, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It is a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a promise of the opinion," said Simon Haeder, an expert in political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows the spirit of struggle to maintain faith as they enter the Sunday single game
After three unilateral sessions on Saturday afternoon the foursomes may have been exactly what Ryder Cup of the year needed.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a fully-declared concept of sports, but nevertheless some players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the moment is now?
"They led with six points and now it's four, so we'll carry it with us as a little moment," said Jordan Spieth when he left the course for the day.
Of course, Europe will have the advantage – they lead with four points and it is 12 to play for.
But as Spirit says the Americans feel that they have received some wind in the sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spirit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Speeth has delivered outstanding games from tea to green, and leads by example.
The deep wedding screams got higher after each as his round continued, and fell to a decisive putting to lift the match to undecided when he and Thomas were two below after two.
His fitting, which won them the 15th match, was met with a similar cry – of the variety that shows that he still does not believe that the American team is useless.
"We really just have to put all the clubs on and focus on our own match," Spieth said.
That's all each of these players now.
18 inches to make an impression.
The only players who have got more points than Speeth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, which is undoubtedly Ryder Cups' great success story.
Europe's extraordinary but glorious couples have four of them and do not make a mistake.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who avoided a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy looks to move both to and from the living crowd make it clear that they are the greatest competitors of the Sunday, and there are no other players in the audience or will see to it that a European victory goes down over Le Golf National than Freewood or Molinari.
Anyway, both at once, in each hole.
However, it is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson got away with Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of the morning, when he was partnering with Alex Noren.
After one bowey and two doubles during the first nine holes the Spaniard and Swedish were so far on demand that they did not have the chance to take the advance again.
But on Sunday, there's no help getting.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look closely at because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can turn at a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the battle spirit of individual, especially in the USA, has missed.
Europe leads 10-6 at the beginning of the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong lead at the start of Ryder Cups last day, after completing the Sunday fourball and foursomes match with 10-6 leadership against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins against a broken Tiger Woods, and raised their score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European side, fighting to preserve the trophies lost by Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unfortunate side in the morning's football and won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. gave more resistance to foursomes and won two matches, but they didn't get any further advance.
Jim Fury's page must get eight points from Sunday's 12 single game to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European smoke that has received four points in a row, and he and Molinari – who together have received the nickname “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend – are the only couple who have received four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cups history.
After having broken Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they collaborated smoothly to beat down Woods and the American rocket Bryson Dechambeau with even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who held through two matches on Saturday, sparkled into intimidating, but has now lost 19 of its 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in row.
Justin Rose, who spent the morning at fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and performed a 2&1 match against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who is ranked number one and three worldwide.
But Europe didn't get everything they wanted on this hot day with a light breeze south of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who won the major three times, set the standard for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a hard 2&1 match over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has a team ready to get in after a four-point advance at the start of the single game, but as current holders only need to get Fury's side undecided to keep the trophies.
But having been almost best for two days doesn't seem like they'll be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will "in no way" join unilateral disarmament without confidence
On Saturday, the US Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations that continued sanctions strengthened the mistrust against the United States and that the country would in no way unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's annual General Assembly that North Korea has implemented "significant goodwill measures" over the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, disassembling the nuclear test area and by not spreading nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a gradual nuclear destruction, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament steps, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear destruction completely, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on 12 June, at the very first meeting between a President-in-Office of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work against the nuclear destruction of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has requested a formal ending of the Korean War, which took place from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed calls for the reduction of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
«USA insists on 'attributing nuclear energy first' and lifts the pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force and even by 'the declaration of the end of the war', according to Ri.
"Trusting that sanctions can force us in our knees is a dream of desire for people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for a second match between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed in front of the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months and added: “If the other party in this disarmament case was South Korea, or the United States, the nuclear destruction of Korea would not have been as locked as it is.”
However, the tone of Ris' speech was very different from that of the four-year-old, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on the mainland US with North Korea missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Onde President" Trump called Kim a "rakettmann" on a suicide mission.
Having threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea yesterday, Trump stood before the UN this year and rocked Kim to be brave enough to take down steps, but said that much work still remains, and the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is depleted.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he did not have a time frame for this, and said that “It has nothing to say if it takes two years, three years, or five months”.
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures implemented.
But US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions of the Security Council must still be enforced strongly and without exception until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear suppression."
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and missile weapons programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and said after that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that they had made progress, but only hours after the North Korean prosecution to have come to him with "walking demands".
North Korea committed itself at a meeting with Moon this month to bring down a missile area and a nuclear weapon plant if the United States did ‘appropriate measures’.
He said Kim had said that these "corresponding measures" he wanted, were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalise the relationship to Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help the students to get more sleep by taking on the growing occult by sneaking through the night with caffeine drinks as fuel.
An academic found that students at the best university in the world often had no idea how they would take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He started the course after holding a lecture on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
"After the talk, a girl came to me and said, 'Why has no one ever said this before?'
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains to students how important it is with good sleep habits in order to perform academically and sportingly, and to the general state.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and adm. dir. for university health services, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw students suffer from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a bedroom where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, jogging shoes and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons allows participants to think about their own daily routine.
“We are aware that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know about this, in the same way that you have the right to know about the risk of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in being able to puke all night, he said, and let modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on the students led to an increasing problem of sleeplessness.
Enough sleep should be the ‘secret weapon’ of the students against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in hunger mode, which leads to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare the course. He took one of the classes of professors last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course that was available for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all the master students to take a similar study program before they are enrolled at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students put on an alarm for when they were to lay down as well as for when they were to stand up and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic displays and LED lights.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Target of Menga eliminates Gerard's men
Rangers led quite a walk away when Dolly Menga's goal hit Steven Gerard's team 1-0 on Livingston.
Ibrox-side wanted to win its first win since February 4–1 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss of 18 matches as manager and left since his eight points from Ladbroke's Premiership Leaders Hearts.
Squeeze up to seven minutes before the break, and Rangers were never able to compensate.
Rangers are now falling in sixth place, while Livingstone climbs up to third and is behind Hibernian on target differences.
There may be more trouble in fermentation for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown from the outside audience.
Gerard made eight shifts on the team, as he walked past Ayr and entered the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Heart's last week, and he would have been glad to see how his well - trained team beat the opponents.
Rangers had perhaps the most possession of the ball, but Livingstone did more with it while they had it.
They would have scored only two minutes in the match when Menga's first match sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle player lost the chance.
A long fresco of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the target.
Rangers took control, but it seemed as if their game was more in hope than belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he would have a penal park after a quarter, when he and Steven Lawless co-directed, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected this.
Rangers managed only two shots on targets in the first round, but earlier Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly didn't get any problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head and a stupid kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis' opening in 34 minutes may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the race.
Once again, Rangers failed to handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who held his head called when he chose the Amount for a simple conclusion.
Gerard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the pause, and the player switch gave immediate results when the player sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingstone managed to get the missing players to play exactly the kind of fight they like, while Lithgow and Halkett caught up with a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's side could have pulled the lead in the last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before Lithgow's head from the corner.
Rangers exchange Glenn Middleton had quite a late demand for a criminal park, he had the port in conflict with Jacobs, but then Thomson left.
Almanac: Founder of Geiger counter
And now a page from Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm «Hans» Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a discovery that led to the device we know today as the geiger counter.
Geigerteller has been an important part of science since then, and has also become a part of popular culture through the film «Bells of Coronado» from 1950, with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man says, "What is this in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter. It finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you pick up these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals emits.»
Evans: "Let's say it makes sound now!"
His Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63-year-old day.
But the invention he gave his name, lives on.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them into a laboratory
Cells can now "see" a protein that is common in many forms of cancer and then injected again in the patient.
A vaccine under examination has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, who learns the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced that the ovarian strength she suffered from disappearing for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them into the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2, which is typical of many forms of cancer, and then injecting these cells again into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure, taken from the patient and ‘trained’ to deal with cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West, wearing an MAGA hat, came with fierce defense of Trump after the SNL action.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was built in a studio on Saturday Night Live after a Familiar event where he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would put in elections in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he longed out against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
"It happens so often that I talk to a white person, and then he says, "How can you be like Trump, he's racist?"
If I was afraid of racism, I had moved from the United States long ago," he said.
SNL started a show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee of the charges of sexual assault presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of the West was uploaded in social media by comics Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock wanted to mock the West by putting out the recording.
The West also complained to the public that he had heard it in the back room about the choice of headgear.
‘They're calling me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
The mob!
And then they said that I don't understand what the reality is," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want me to see that I understand what the reality is?" he said, and he said that he would "take the Supermann hat on me, because then no one can tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comments were made at least twice, and the employees who worked on SNL so smoothly reported Variety, where a staff member said, “The whole studio was dead.”
The West was introduced as the last little replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, when her girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: «To one of our most courageous: TAK FOR YOU MASSENE.»
But talkshower Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "who he is and it's totally amazing".
‘But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’) which I believe is growing and asking for ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That's us too," she added.
Before the show announced the rapper on Twitter that he had changed his name, he said that from now on he was "the most formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change names and now follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rappercollege Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion. Then of course it is the dead musical Prince, who changed the name of a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington longs out against "gift masculinity"
Kit Harington is known from the role of the sword hunter Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticised the stereotype of the macho helmet and says such roles in movies often get young men to believe they have to be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something went wrong and wondered how to tackle the problem of "toxic masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones-College Rose Leslie, also 31 years of age, agreed that he was very busy with the theme.
"I'm quite worried about it now – where did it go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV can have parts of the blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" due to the strong masculine roles.
He continued, "What is born with it, and what is it associated with it?
What is broadcast on TV and street, what is it that makes young boys feel that they have to grow up just this side by being a man?
I think it's one of the really big questions in our time – how can we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admits that he will not make any sequels or successors of the Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and says he is "completed with battlefields and horses".
From November Kit will play the main role in a new recording of Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a rancher.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife during the recordings, and that way it came out of it – my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kit's role figure Jon Snow is in love, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at the property of the Leslies family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 % increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14 % in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been hit in the country, says the Health Representative.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The large majority of new cases have been transferred through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China by infection through blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now closer to zero, Chinese health personnel said at a conference in the Yunnan province.
However, for a year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is said to be high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90 % of men who have sex with men, after each marriage, are married to women.
Much of the disease is due to insufficient protection in sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese authorities have promised general access to HIV medicine as part of a measure to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to cooperate with leaked data on Republican senators, exploits «dangerous lies» and «conspiration theories»
Member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, denied Saturday charges that members of her staff had posted the personal data to three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
The democracy of Los Angeles secured the claims was made by ‘ultraconservative’ commentators and web pages.
"Lessons, lies and more repugnant lies," said Waters in an opinion on Twitter.
The published information included the addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the web Thursday, released by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on the charges of assault against the highest-right candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators kicked out Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was traced to the Waters' office and revealed information about a member of the Waters' staff, according to Hill.
"This unwarranted charge is completely wrong and a regular lie," the Waters continued.
"The members of my staff - who have received their identities, personal data and security compromised as a result of these irregular and false charges - had absolutely no responsibility for the leaking of this information.
This unwarranted charge is totally wrong and a regular lie’.
Waters' statement was quickly criticised on the Internet, among other things by former press secretary in the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This curse is aggressive," Fleischer wrote.
‘This indicates that she does not have the right temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
They don't have to go to defense.
They must not question the accused's motives.
They must act in a calm and quiet manner.’
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being aggressive during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate working to remove Waters in the middle of the elections, also air his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great – if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In his opinion, Waters said that her office had warned "relevant authorities and the police about these false charges".
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are discovered," she continued "and that they are held responsible for all acts that are destructive and dangerous to each of my staff".
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again – bloodthirsty Rowan Atkinson in spy parody
It has become a tradition now to look at Brexit's indications in all new films with a British moment and it seems to be current for this re-resurrection of the parodyfranche Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and re-established in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Would Sarcastic self-satisfaction about how obvious we are to become the nation's new export products?
in any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bubbling eyes and rubber face have been renewed his license to rotate it for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comical figure intended on territories with non-English cinema audiences.
He is, of course, the foolish secret agent who despite his great-grandfather James Bond ambitions is a mixture of Clouseau, a désj Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes with one single note in the musical recording of the fire-tight theme during the opening ceremony at OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the role Atkinson played in the longer forgotten TV ads of Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery that leaves chaos everywhere.
There's one and another great moment in Johnny English's last ride.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in Middle Ages and the rotor blades cut his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy comes to its right, but humor feels quite bloodthirsty and strangely overwhelming, especially now that the ‘serious’ brands such as 007 and Mission Nexus are willing to escape comedy.
The humor seems to be more directed towards children than adults, and for me Johnny English's fads aren't as inventive and eating as Mr. Bean's stupid eyeballs.
The current premium is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the contempt of the vigilante agent – a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a minister of state, a pumped-down figure already undergoing a complete crisis of political populism: Emma Thompson is doing a very good job with this similarly-Teresa-May role, but the manuscript does not give her much to work with.
The counsellors inform her that since each active spy has been discovered, she must pick up some of the retired.
And that means the cloned Johnny English, who now teaches at a snobbed institution, but gives informal instruction in secret intelligence, and there are some kind of sequences here when English offers a rock academy for spying.
English is tapped back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and re-consulted with his old, afflicted help bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, apart from a commandant, a hysterical superclass boy where Vicki Pepperdine is a little thrown away.
So Batman and Robin's style of rotating everything to the command of the queen are back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko amazing woman fatale, Ophelia Bulletin.
At the same time, the Minister of State will be led by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve the British cyber problems: the luscious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start the trip with dangerous side-steps: dressed as servants they put the guys at a prestigious French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding on board Volta luxury yacht; and English triggers the clean anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to become familiar with Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even so loving and noisy it is so much that it remembers children-TV with all the stuff.
Quite average, it's all.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Workers bless that they plan to let the British work on Thursdays, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will evaluate a radical plan that will give the British a four-day work week – but get paid for five.
The Party would obviously require operators to use savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving workers an extra week off.
This will result in a three-day holiday for employees while they receive the same salary.
Sources say that the idea fits into the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favour of workers.
Trade unions support the transition to four-day jobs so that workers can also enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party said The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
‘It will not happen overnight, but the four-day cycle is an ambition that matches the party’s desire to let the pendulum fluctuate for the benefit of the workers – in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy.’
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. Green Party promised a four-day exam during the campaign before the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea is not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A spokesperson for Labour said: "A four-day trial is not the party's policy, and is not judged by the party".
Financial spokesman for Labour, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to withdraw the power of ‘recognised directors’ and ‘occupiers’ from public service providers.
The plans of the shadow canal also mean that the current shareholders of water companies are at risk of not getting the full share item back because a Labour regime can make ‘deductions’ based on perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the company boards and set up employee funds to transfer 10 % of the equity to private sector companies to employees, which may receive an annual dividend of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" about the FBI review of Kavanaugh can make them change their mind.
The FBI review of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has put forward a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court with at least one week and raises the question of the Agency's finding may cause some Republican senators to change their views.
In an interview that was sent Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open to it than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the opening of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and said, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, scoundrel, certain."
Graham's voice, however, seems to have been stuck in stone.
‘I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and in that case it must be an eye-opening finding,’ he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brettly defeated it energetically," added Graham and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
‘And none of them could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't think anything new will change that."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed to combating poverty?
This Saturday is New York host to the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive list of stars to perform and a similar impressive mission; eliminates world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, which is now in its seventh year, will have thousands of people streaming to the great plenary in Central Park, not only to experience sizes such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real goal of the event to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to combat poverty by bringing more people to work actively against poverty.
In order to obtain a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or «actions», such as voluntary work, send an e-mail to a world leader, take a phone call or other meaningful ways to raise awareness about their poverty eradication target.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when it's only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for change, or just a case of so-called 'clitivism' - that people feel a great deal of help by signing a signature campaign on the web or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million «actions» from their supporters, with a range of objectives.
They say that these actions have contributed to making world leaders declare their commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 exposures and announcements resulting from their shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secure funding has so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main exposures are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and founders based in the United Kingdom that will "help children to exploit their full potential", and promised to provide Rwanda $35 million to contribute to the eradication of mishap in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice by undermining a footnote in history," the Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 shares in the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, "What makes you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road – including we will fall and fall.
But like the important civil rights and anti-partiety movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman on the occasion of the year's event in New York.
The United States may use the marine as "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports - the Minister of the Interior
Washington may ‘if necessary’ because to prevent Russian energy when markets, inter alia in the Middle East, revealed the US Minister of Home Affairs, Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, in particular when operating at the invitation of the legal government, is an asset to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flag of Europe," he said.
And according to the speaker, there are always ways and means to deal with this.
«The United States has the opportunity to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that energy does not reach the market» he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants on the event held by Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal organisation that profiled itself as ‘the voice of energy consumers’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's ways of communicating with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are much the same.
‘The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is to exploit and replace fuel’, he said and referred to Russia as ‘one trick pony’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The opinions came after the Trump administration has been on a round trip to strengthen the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, and they want to replace Russia, the most affordable option for European consumers.
Therefore, employees of the Trump administration, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘inappropriate’ project The North European Gas Leader 2, which according to Trump made Berlin a ‘captive’ in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline is worth $11 billion, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's glowing opposition to the project is only justified by economic reasons and is an example of regular competition.
"I believe we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool for the exercise of pressure and that consumers must be able to choose a supplier," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States has met with resistance from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitments in the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have major problems with third countries that interfere with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the leader of the BDI after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" at his 2020 presidential candidacy, Senator of Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would “consider seriously” whether she would remain as a presidential candidate after the elections.
During a election meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would remain silent.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix the shady government, and it includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
‘After 6 November, I will seriously consider whether I should become a presidential candidate’.
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election meeting and said that he "led the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm completely worried about what Donald Trump is doing with democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his highest-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI review before we vote."
However, a statement published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren’s own electorate does not consider it to be in 2020.
58% of the ‘probably’ voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be silent, according to an opinion from Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidacy.
The survey showed higher support to former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidacy and 48% opposed it.
Other highly-profiled democratic names discussed in connection with a possible candidate in 2020 are among the other vice-president Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
By saying he would officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palin's PTSD at Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being occupied in seven.
He was arrested and targeted for a domestic violence Monday night
"What my son goes through, what he goes through after coming home, I have in common with other families that experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers have with him," she told the audience at a election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest «the elephant in the room» and said about the son and other war veterans: «They come home a little changed, they come home the shepherd, they come home and wonder if this is the respect for what their soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country».
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and the aim of violence at a woman's home, clogging with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the police in Wasilla.
18 countries and D.C. support the testing of new asylum policies
The eight countries and the District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States that refuses asylum to victims who flee from repetitive or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 countries and D.C. provided guidance from friends curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union brought against the federal police in August has not been published.
She claimed that the partner "and his violent son-in-law" abused her, but authorities in the United States refused her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, such as nations with cross-cutting problems of reproduction and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a decision by the Court of Appeal in 2014 on immigrants who gave undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence the right to apply for asylum.
State attorney Karl Racine in District of Columbia said in a statement Friday that the new policy "is away from decades of state, federal and international law".
‘Federal law requires all asylum requirements to be determined based on the particular facts and circumstances of the requirement, and such a prohibition is contrary to that principle’, said the guidance of amicitus curiae.
The lawyers further argued in the orientation that the policies that refused immigrants access damage the US economy and say that there is a great likelihood that they will be more founded and "help with the necessary labour".
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who fled from domestic violence and relapse in June.
‘Asyl is available to those leaving the country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political view’, the Sessions said in the announcement of 11 June on policy.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue action in Palu – the death figures are doubled in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It was very exciting," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish son at an evacuation centre in the most complicated city of Palu.
“All the time, you see ambulances that are all gone.
Pure water is poorer.’
It was possible to see residents who came to damaged homes and ease through damaged assets in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged in the earthquake that had strength 7.5, were filled.
Some of the damage, including Dwi Haris, that broke the back and shoulder, is outside the Palus military hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing severe post-disease.
He gets tears in his eyes when he repeats how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room in the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves safely.
I was crammed by the wall growing together, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to participate in a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of ‘tracing’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after a public Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American newspaper condemning the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, US ambassador to China Beijing accused US ambassadors of using American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the annex China Daily paid to withdraw to the Des Moines Register – the most selling newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the American Congress elections on 6 November, a Chinese statement rejects.
Trump's statement that Beijing tried to influence the US election marked a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to press China, according to Reuters.
It is quite normal for foreign authorities to use advertisements to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are locked in a escalating trade war that has led rounds with new tariff rates on each other's imports.
China’s early criminal duty in the trade war was to frame export holdings in countries such as Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, reports Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former multi-year governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has hit US workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reading site in Sunday's Des Moines Register: "China steps up the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities take advantage of the freedom of expression and the open press that we enjoy in America to place a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“As a contrast – at the aiscojosken on the street here in Beijing you don’t find many divergent opinions and do not have real reflections among ordinary Chinese people around China’s problematic economic course, given that the media is below the threshold of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: “One of China’s biggest newspapers rejected the offer to publish” his article, even though he did not disclose what newspaper it was.
Republicans withdraw female electors before the Kavanaugh fads' intervention, alert analysts
As many top politicians among the Republicans support and defend the highest right candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who have received several charges of sexual abuse directed against themselves, analysts warn that they will receive a reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The feelings around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given evidence that they want to move on with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," said Grant Reeher, a professor of state science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s proposal for an FBI review in the last second would be enough to calm down the electorate.
"Women will not forget yesterday's events – they will not forget it tomorrow and not November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington newspaper D.C.
Friday morning, the protesters sang "November is coming!" while they demonstrated at the sessions of the Senate when the Republicans who control the judicial committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the witness statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will explode," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could have been higher, especially among women's uncertain voters in the suburbs and younger voters between 18 and 29 years of age, who often do not vote even if they deny the president.”
Even before the Ford's public witness, which gave a detailed description of the charges for sexual abuse against the highest-right candidate, analysts thought that there would be a reaction if the Republicans forced the appointment.
"This has become a blessed root of the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
“It is not just about the Committee’s vote or the final approval or the introduction of Kavanaugh – it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it,” said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group promoting the election of democratic candidates, to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about whom they should believe in the cold water of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a small majority in favour of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents were fully or fairly convinced about Ford's testimony, while 35% said they were fully or fairly convinced about Kavanaugh's production.
In addition, 38 % said that they were quite or entirely convinced that Kavanaugh lied under his testimony, while only 30 % said the same about Ford.
After the Flake game, the FBI is investigating the claims made by Ford in addition to at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate's judicial committee last week that Kavanaugh was in a state of abuse when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the highest right candidate exposed his genitals to her while they were at the party during the study period at Yale in the 1980s.
The author of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the author of the World Wide Web, launches a start to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology agency, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users may choose where their data should be stored and the persons who have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the purpose is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
‘It is a historic moment’.
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own personal data storage online or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
What is unique with the online personal data storage is that it is up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authorisation through data’.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to the company CEO, John Bruce, that the company must provide with resources, process and relevant competence to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some initial developers on the contract to work with the project and a number of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team do not talk to «Facebook and Google that they should introduce something completely new or not, which would make their business models completely recalibrated overnight.
‘We do not ask for their permission’.
In an introduction to the Media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "commitment is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that contributes to the protection of the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic in view of the next epoch of the network," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: Celebration of Victoria Corses recipient from World War I
The only priest in the English church who was awarded a Victorian Crusade during World War I as a rival was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Colonel and priest Bernard Water was awarded the certificate of honour on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a snowman four days later and was never told that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A monument was discovered by his two children at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his childhood children, Michael Water, said it was a "fine symbol" in that the stone was to be discovered exactly 100 years after the grandfather's award-winning taste.
According to London Gazette, Captain Water Battalion was led over Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29th – «through much thick fog and under heavy protection from cannons and masquerades».
Later he directed towards the firing line and led the line “with a great contrast” forward before he stormed a field cannon by himself and threw out three of the departments.
Colonel Water was killed by a German snowman on October 4, 1918 — only a month before the war was over.
Michael Watern, 72, said that the grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but something that made me humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Water also laid down a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Corps.
Michael Watern said he “was very pleased to play a role in the parade” and added: “The bravery of a real one is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people”.
MMA trailers were up all night to watch the Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa pig
Make sure you stay up all night to see the compact Bellator 206, just to find out you don't get to see the main fight.
The participant from San Jose succeeded through 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown directly through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00, while Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the eyes of the United Kingdom sat waving as the image suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Someone was less impressed after keeping awake until early morning to see the fight.
A trailer described on Twitter the transition to the children's program as "a kind of search joke".
‘It is a state regulation that it is not appropriate to send such programmes at 6:00, so they had to switch to children’s programmes,’ said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Bellator for marketing and communication, when he was asked about the shipment.
"Grey Poppa, yes!".
Bellator's Managing Director, Scott Coker, said they're going to work on the mission plan to include the visions in Britain in the future.
"I think we can figure it out for the fight," said Coker.
"But it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday there, and we won't be able to solve this before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me-- when we were over, there were many messages going back and forth, and they weren't exactly the friendly sort.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't, it was a matter of authority.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We want to reduce from six to five matches – which we usually send – and we tried to distance ourselves far from the trailers, but tipped over.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to sexuality
The Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority to everyone because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn't before in high school that he realized that "he wasn't like others".
In the first Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the rights of homophils to give other "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned with winning OL.
The usual programme leader of the traditional programme, Kirsty Young, shall be away for a few months due to disease.
Daley stood out as a little away from the first shipment of Laverne and said he felt “less worth” than all the others he grew up with because “it was not socially acceptable to equal both boys and girls”.
He said, "To this day, these feelings of being inferior and otherwise have been the real motivation and I have the strength and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He's twice as a bronze winner in the OL and has become a highly profiled LGBT ambassador, and he used his participation in Australia's National Assembly Party to appeal for several countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he's standing because he feels he's lucky who can live openly without negative consequences and wants to give other "hope".
The three times the world master said that he fell in love with a man - filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 - "I was surprised".
Daley married Oscar's friend, who's 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much in such a young age” – he took part in his first OL when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said the "whole perspective" of his had been changed.
"If you had asked me yesterday, everything turned out that I just had to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals in OL.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after receiving the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had obtained tickets to London in 2012 – since he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't live long enough to sit on the first row," he said.
"I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The year after Daley competed in OL 2012 and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – to step in front of a home audience under the OL, the best feeling ever," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – which meant a lot to him in the run before OL and which still gives him goose skin.
Desert Island Disks goes on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Form vacuum Mickelson taken out to the golf tournament Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to get in shape if it's not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennium for impressive 12th time, was put on the bench of Captain Jim Furyk before the master's fourball and foursome-combats.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he so often had been for the United States, the five times the major-winner divides the day between being healers and working with his game at the range in hopes of fixing what is cutting.
The 48-year-old never had the best swing, even at the top of the career and is not in perfect shape for the strict Le Golf National track, where the long rough area still penalises wild blows.
And if the track in itself is not scary enough, meets Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, the British Open Master Francesco Molinari himself, who has met with the new beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of the fights their week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 single games, get a successful start, Mickeyson's games can prove to be crucial.
Fury expresses confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on his back and left his arm around me and said he would be ready next day," said Furyk.
“He has great confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has added so much to these laws earlier, and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games for me.
I saw for me more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will hit Nick Faldo's record for most played Ryder Cup champions on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven undecided, but Fury said his participation brought some intangible values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, white and likes to have fun with others. He's a great guy to have in the storage room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He's giving a lot more than just the game."
European legislator Thomas Bjørn knows that his great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European legionnaire, knows from experience that a significant leadership at the entry of the last day's single game in Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 campaign at Valderrama, where one side led by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the cared to itself the sea with a minimum margin, 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2.
"You still remember that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we got used, but only if we did," said Bjørn, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else on the team that this isn't over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Come out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have got the points on the table.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we are very aware of what is on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Bears are very pleased with how his players have made their way on the steep golf course and add: “I couldn’t do it better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performances that are at the center, and there's something else.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, your performances that play golf are tested to the full.
It's the message you have to tell the players that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave the partner, and he must also go out and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjørn, the opponent Jim Furyk will try to get his players to deliver better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three of four points.
Fury himself has been on both sides of the big revolutions last day, and he was on the victory team at Brooklyn before he ended up losing when Europe carried out the "miracle of Medina".
I remember every condemned word of it," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the commander of law in 1999, had inherited his players at the entrance to the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but one would like to have a good start, like the one we experienced at Brooklyn, as we saw at Medina.
When the moment starts to go in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle battles.
We arrange our configuration then and send out the people in the way we feel about it.
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the fight and challenge Rory McIlroy in the summit, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the order of players.
"I'm betting on this group of men in that order because I think it's all the way," Bjørn said about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warships delayed again
The German Navy's latest frigate would have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the cold war, but it will not happen before next year due to failing systems and galloping costs, reported local media.
The completion of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leader of the completely new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been exposed to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quoted a military figure.
The ship would have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery followed the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered back in 2007, will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It has been agreed that they should be equipped with a strong cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-shipcraft missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it would be possible to apply the latest frigates for up to two years away from home port.
Continual delays, however, mean that the advanced warships – they were told to give Germany strength on the sea – will already be delayed before they are put in service, Die Zeit reports.
The fateful F125 Fregate created headlines last year, as the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the paint Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the marine has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media referred to a number of important ‘software and hardware defects’ that made the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important since vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers - only half of the crew of the older Frigates of the Bremen class.
It was also discovered that the ship has a huge overweight, which reduces the performance and limits the marine's ability to make future upgrades.
The 7000-tonne heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price patch on the whole project – including training of the human being – has also started to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached EUR 3.1 billion – from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of fresh warnings that Germany's marine strength is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Government Defence Committee, confirmed that the marine is actually "empty for usable ships".
The officer said that the problem has been escalating over time because old ships were exploding, but there was no new vessel.
He regrets that none of the frogs in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the marine.
National Trust remains a thief on the secret life of flag mice
New research carried out at a property in the Scottish Highland shall determine how flag mice use the landscape in the pursuit of food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and contribute to the design of future conservation measures.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual flag and dvergflaggermus as well as brunettes and water flaggermus at the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special receivers will be placed at important locations around the property to track flag mouse activity during the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Experts' audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of flag mouse calls and the species that do what.
A habitat map and a report will then be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Adviser, hopes the results will discover which areas of the habitat are most important for flag mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will be part of the decision on the measures to be taken, such as the establishment of pasture grounds and how best to keep in the forest for bats and other associated species.
The flag muss population in Scotland and the United Kingdom have fallen considerably through the past centuries.
They are threatened by construction and construction that affects young people's places and the restriction of habitats.
Windmills and lighting may also pose a risk, the same as flue paper and certain chemically treated building materials, as well as household taxes attacks.
The flag mouse is actually not blind.
But because of their night hunting habits, they have more use for their ears than their eyes when it comes to catching change.
They use advanced ecolocation to find insects and obstacles on their way when they fly.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flag mice very seriously.
They have ten competent experts who regularly carry out studies, youth mapping and rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only own flag mouse reserve at the Thrave land property of Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten flag species.
Property Manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a perfect area for flaggermus," he says.
«We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about flag mice, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need to survive."
He stresses the importance of mapping the flag mice before maintaining an property since the inevitable destruction of a single young space can kill up to 400 dogs and young people, and perhaps investigate an entire local population.
Flaggermus is protected, and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or disturb them or destroy their youth.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish employee for Bat Conservation Trust, has invited the audience to help in the work.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our flag mice, and for many of the species we simply don't know how the populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of violence while lawyers will file a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the charges of violence against himself as "false news" and says that people "want fame" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to investigate the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's accused of paying her $375 000 in the afternoon for keeping close to the event, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
When he spoke on a direct video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the charges were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo rejected the charges as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said five times winner of the Golden Ball into the camera.
«They want fame by using my name.
It's normal.
They want fame by giving my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine," adds the football player with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on the grounds of the claims, which they have called ‘an unacceptable manufacture of suspicions in the private sphere’, according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the football player will require compensation for ‘reward damage to an extent equivalent to the severity of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious breaches of the privacy system in recent years’.
The alleged event will have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga must have gone back to the footballer's room, where he was likely to have raped her anal, according to documents submitted to the district court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99% a good person" who was betrayed by the "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later they found a case outside the court because she was "free for revenge" and was also concerned about "being publicly suspended".
The 34th year she says she's now trying to make the difference because she's still traumatized after the alleged event.
Ronaldo was about to cross from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged overcrowding, and moved this summer to Italian Youth on a contract worth EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom Will ensure the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom ‘will provide for eternity’ if they lose their status as world leader in car production by Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was 'disquieting' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without agreement, they would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of late border crossing of any Brexit without agreement could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will, in my view, experience that production at our factory stops," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other British producers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on how trade across borders will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that they will close the mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is whether the car manufacturer says there are supply chains at any Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of ‘order as required’ and comes every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may remain at the border, as industry says, it may lead to delays and lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's stock at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production will stop.
Clark said that Theresa Mays Brexit's future EU-connection plan is "precisely designed to avoid such border checks".
"We have to have an agreement, we want to get the best agreement that makes us not only able to enjoy success at the moment, but also taking this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The budget, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped but warned that long-term increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and after each loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallais, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union leader at the factory, said that the members are becoming increasingly concerned: "My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back".
A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU"
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be exposed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's fateful meeting with Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein may be "exposed one more week" while the struggle around the highest-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein has oversight of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian involvement in the election, relations between Trump and Russia as well as possible obstacles to the judiciary of the President.
The question of Trump will be rejected by the Minister of Justice or not, and thus threatens Mueller's independence, has for many months narrowed up during the speculations in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of recording the talks with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th basic law supplement.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was about to volunteer.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather let go" to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was held to avoid that it coincided with the Senate's judicial committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnesses.
On Friday Trump ordered an FBI review of one week's charges against Kavanaugh, which further put forward a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
On the question of the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for the meeting was not fixed; it could be this week, but I understood it could be a week of suspension because of everything that happens with the highest right.
But we'll see, and I'm always busy keeping the press up to date."
Some journalists will contest this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Programmed Chris Wallace asked the cause.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to opposition to the "self-worthiness" reported on TV, although she added: "I do not disagree with the fact that they are self-godly".
Then she indicated that the contact between Trump and the press would be more frequent.
‘The President raises more questions than any previous president,’ she said and added without presenting evidence: ‘We have seen the figures’.
There will still be press conferences, said Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it will be absolutely better than talking to me.
We're trying to get it up a lot, and you've seen that we've done it a lot in the last few weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open assemblies or press conferences when visiting important persons.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause, when he made a solo race and sometimes had a strange behavior in front of a number of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit concerns
The Secretary of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS (public health) to express the country's gratitude and a desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish member of parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain was supposed to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of applying for residence and employment permits for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU on the release have taken place in the summer and are expected to land on a solution to the harvest.
However, the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
So I would like to repeat how much I value the effort of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and outside, provide valuable experiences and expertise that strengthen and improve the work of health care to the best of the patients and local communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely their home and we sincerely hope you will be here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Defence Player at Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent rapid surgery after having suffered a head injury during the payer's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in Tennessee newspaper.
Tennessee State's main coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the damage happened just before the first round was over.
"He came out on the sideline and just collapsed there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a bar and took him back for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been operated at the Wanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘not yet available information on the type/range of the damage’ and Tennessee State is trying to identify when the damage occurs.
Abercrombie, a second-year-old student, is in her first season with Tennessee State after transition from Illinois.
He had five picks on Saturday before he ended the match, which gives in all 18 picks for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they purchase an property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they purchase property in the United Kingdom.
The change will neutralise the success of Corby's plan to attract young voters
The increase in document fees will be levied from those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Experts in the Department of Finance expect it to increase to 120 million pounds a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May today will announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they purchase property in the United Kingdom – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be considered as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's plan to attract young voters with a promise to offer more reasonable housing and a framework for higher income groups.
The increase in document fees will be imposed on persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; the additional money will strengthen the government's measures to remedy the situation of the homeless.
The profit – which comes in addition to the current document fee, including the higher rate introduced two years ago on residential number two and rental purchases – may be as much as 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to bring up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 % of newly built property in London is purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which drives prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get their feet in the housing market.
Many well-being areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “spaking cities” due to the many foreign buyers who are mostly staying outside the country.
The new policy will only come weeks after Boris Johnson came with proposals for a reduction in the document fee to help several young people to own their own home.
He accused large construction companies to keep the housing prices high by buying out land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May refuse allowances on reasonable housings to solve Britain's 'favourable housing policy'.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a number of proposed housing reforms, including rental checks and an end to unwarranted drafts.
He also wants to give the municipal authorities greater power to build new dwellings.
May said, "Yesterday, I said that I would spend my time as a minister of state to restore the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions to our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy dwellings that are too hard-working British citizens.
Too many people have dreamed of owning their own homes too far, and the valueless situation of the homeless’.
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old bulkhead is pleased with the challenge of reviving the club in the north-east, which currently holds a third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after having led St. Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I got a B-caps and that's it," Ross told the BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I was often with my father and saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there is always something that pulls me back.
However, that possibility would only come if I succeeded in the club victory."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic chief says he was not anxious to follow such established names in the great club, and has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
‘Success for me at the moment will be measured if I can get the club back in Premier League’.
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, they are probably among the Premier League," he said.
It's not a simple task to get it there, but I'll probably just think of myself as having failed here if I get the club back there."
Ross has only been in management for three years, after a period as assistant chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month short performance in Hearts' training staff.
Then he helped Alloa to return from depression to the third division and helped St. Mirren from the edge of depression to win the title next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did under the career of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was likely a real difference of way," he recalls when he took over the management of Alloa.
"I really thought management was right for me, more right than playing.
It sounds nice since I did it well, created me a reasonable income of it and experienced some fine highlights.
But football can be tough.
There's a lot of things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
I go abroad with regard to stress and pressure in the job, but management feels quite right for me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do it. It feels like the most comfortable I've known throughout my adult life."

The perfect time for a half-litre is 17.30 on Saturdays, showing study
The heat wave of the summer has strengthened the revenues of the hard-pressed pubs of the United Kingdom, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a turnover increase of 2,7 % in July – while the revenues for restaurants dropped 4,8 %, the figures showed.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant, who summarised the figures, said: “Continuing the sunscreen and England’s unexpected long participation in World Cup, July followed a pattern similar to that of the previous month in June, when the pubs rose 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8 % in the restaurant composition in June was only worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had a far better result, but an increase that was stronger like-for-like that restaurant went down.
Food-serving pubs also had difficulty with the sun, even though it was not as dramatic as for the rasaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars increased turnover by 6,6 % that month, with food service decreased by 3 %’.
Paul Newman, analysts from the hotel and restaurant industry RSM, said: “These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sports and social events are still the main factors in the external market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups still have difficulties and a turnover of 4,8 % year-on-year will be particularly painful at the top of current cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food-servicing companies, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will give a longer breath room."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2,7 % in July, reflecting the braking of new trade marks.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the industry turnover controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom, collects and analyzes the results of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of 9 billion pounds, and is the established industry standard.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents
One of five children – some are only 11 years of age – has secret accounts on social media that they hide for parents and teachers, showing research
A study of 20,000 youth students discovered pages with ‘Fake Insta’.
The news has raised concerns about sharing sexual content.
20 % of students said they have a ‘main account’ that they show their parents.
One of five children – some are only 11 years of age – create social media accounts that they keep hidden for adults.
A study of 20,000 young students discovered a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts – a reference to screenshots.
The news has raised concerns about sharing sexual content.
20 % of students said they had an innocent ‘main account’ that they refer to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to "violate me".
The research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Rectors' Conference (HMC) for private schools revealed that 40 % of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It is scary that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Elid Doyle will be the ‘voice of the freedom defenders’ in the Scottish Athletics board
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Management Board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role in the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated freelance lawyer, and President Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those who lead the sport to gain insight into her extensive experiences on the international scene over the past ten years.
"Eilid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world-wide area of freedom, and we are sure that the free lawmakers in Scotland will enjoy her in the government," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am excited to act as a voice for freedom activists, and I hope I have much to contribute to guiding the sport in Scotland."
The American won 200 and 400 meters under OL in Atlanta in 1996 and has four OL gold, and she's now a solid BBC expert, and after she got a transient ischemic attack, she couldn't go.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago today, I got a hit.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time would show if I would be restored and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm good again and I've learned to go again, and today I'm doing flexicurity exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows splits their views on the web
A breast pump company has split its opinion on the Internet with an ad comparing breast-feeding mothers with cows being milked.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be ‘the world's first soundless breast pump that is carried close to the body’, the Elvie, the technology-based company for consumer goods, a fresh and floating, music video-inspired ad to show the freedom of the new pump gives active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a label full of high and cows to a song with, among other things, the following text: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see any tail" and "In case you didn't understand it, this is not a jury, it's my dolls."
The choir goes on, "Fuck it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my balls."
However, the ad, published on the company's Facebook page, has created a storm on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, many say the ‘gross’ in the dairy industry.
«Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and fed to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth," it was one who wrote.
Elvie breast pump gets a fine spot in a amme-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Probably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But, hey, why don't you use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another addition: ‘For a failure ad’.
Others defend the ad. A woman admitted that she thinks the song is "incredibly funny".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd love to have one if I still am.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little rust, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," it was one that wrote.
Another comment: ‘This is a fun announcement directed at mothers as pumps (often at the workplace or toilets) and feels like ‘spouses’.
This is not an ad that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry.’
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump in the b's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and gets a fine seat in a amme-bh, so that women get the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: «The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and milk cows, we wanted to put searchlights on breast pumping and all the challenges, while in a entertaining and recognizable way we show the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump gives.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a stepmother appeared on the catwalk of designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Dogs of migrant children moved to a tentyard at the Texas border in all secrets
The number of migrant children detained has been maintained even though the monthly cross-border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children in support players.
Traditionally, most support players themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of being in the country by stepping up and demanding a child.
The risk increased in June as federal authorities announced that potential support players and other adults in the household had to present fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the immigration and customs authorities, testified to the Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who claimed to be supporters of single minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 % of those arrested had not previously had a criminal roll-out sheet.
‘Approximately 80 % of the persons who are either supporters or members of the family of supporters are illegal in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to persecute these people," says Albence.
Officials are trying to handle children more quickly and introduce new rules that require some of them to meet in court within one month of being arrested, and not 60 days that were the previous standard, according to the recipient workers.
Many will be produced through videoconferencing instead of meeting personally to conduct their case of residence permit for an immigration judge.
Those considered as unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or rescue attempts, according to recipients and reports from the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns have grown at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where children who wear lighters are translated because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the counter without getting enough time to prepare emotionally or with friends can strengthen the traumas that many already suffer.
Syria requests the United States, French and Turkish ‘occupational powers’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to come home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, also acting as Minister of State, said that the foreign forces were illegally staying on Syrian soil under the cover of counter-terrorism and ‘will be dealt with afterwards’.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and millions are fleeing.
He said that Damascus will continue to "run this holy struggle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" both for terrorist groups and "all foreign presence".
The United States has around 2000 troops in Syria, mainly for the training and counselling of Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-lorded country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused ‘some Western countries’ for ‘dispersing irrational refugees’ that allow the refugees to stay away.
"We have turned to the international community and humanitarian organisations to arrange for these returns," he said.
They are policing what is really a purely humanitarian situation."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria before a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is reached.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major defence situation of the rebels at Idlib has created an opportunity to press for political talks.
The Russian/Turkish agreement rejected a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces against the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from Al-Qaida-related Nusra Front, who would “will be eliminated”.
The UN broadcast Staffan de Mistura hopes he will soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draw up a post-war law for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem made conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the Committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to ‘transition of the articles of the current basic law’ and to warnings against interference.
Why Trump will win a period of time
After that logic, Trump would have won reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberal spectators are likely to hope, the rule of law and scandals will end the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly become "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!"
At the moment, there's no sign of vision.
Since 2014, the best transmission time saws have doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best transmission time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC «The Rachel Maddow Show» has toped the cables with a total of 3.5 million viewers on evenings with big news items.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to because we don't understand anything," said Neal Baer, programmer of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned comedian and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Five Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club”, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he was going to vote on Trump.
She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh."
It's a entertainment value in chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the actions that are taking place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited and health to the global economy.
Logout is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you extend yourself far to be an enlightened person when you sit down for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "dipdick in background" for the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's leather jacket with struttjevær verd 15,000 dollars (“a scourge struck with hybrids”, said Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniel's colorful descriptions of Trumps, eh..., anatomy.
I don't want to look at Super Mario the same way anymore.
"Some of what he does to make it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, the daily leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's varying role crew and daily turn on the plot (crime with NFL, shamesome Kim Jong-un).

When I met Fleiss this week, it was 27 °C and the sun outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he got into and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He couldn't get rid of it, not when Brett Kavanaugh is going to meet the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the U.S. Supreme Court is at stake.
"I remember when we put all the broken programs in old days and people said that this is the end of the Western civilization," said Fleiss.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from outside flows into the most regular intervals of the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania 17 districts experience a flow of money after a conversion of a congress district that ended with two sitting representatives fighting for the same seat.
This newly established urban district in Pittsburgh is setting up with Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a supplemental election last spring.
Lamb faces another sitting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of the old Pennsylvania, which is largely overlapping the new 17th district.
The map was redrawn after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were a fundamentally illegal manipulation of electoral circles in favour of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race on the financing of the campaign between the largest party funding groups, DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a button victory in a closely followed supplemental election for Pennsylvania 18th district to the Congress in March of last year.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats little leadership.
United States Penal Procedures against El Salvador for Support to China, Then Drag the Threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the management team to Trump Organization.
Officials of the foreign ministry decided to call back the US diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan”, said Heather Nauert, the department’s spokesperson, in an opinion earlier this month.
However, the criminal measures were only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug controls, development and financial support.
The proposed criminal measures, including financial assistance cuts and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high levels of unemployment and death.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials exposed a summit conference focused on security and economic growth to follow up a similar collection last year, which was assessed as a step forward in the attempt to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
By mid-September, however, officials in the Supreme Administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which put an end to all plans for criminal action against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now dedicated to speaking at the conference, which is now planned in mid-October, to show the importance of the administration adding the collection, the diplomat said.
And the three U.S. broadcasts returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson at the White House for Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next speaker in the box may be Special Adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to legal enforcement, which is now very solid evidence for in public documents.
Mueller is also likely to expand the review of whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in the involvement of our elections.
If the congress were to change its side, Trump would be held responsible in that body, in the middle of preparations to meet the electors again and perhaps finally a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not believe that Trump's case is inevitable – nor for his opponents in Europe.
We all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938 German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up against him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years with the bloodbath that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or blocked.
The Americans are facing several of these vibrations now.
What will we do if Trump kicks Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a harsh state since this newspaper reported that he proposed last year secret statements by the president and speculated that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' production is wrong.
‘How will we react if the recent FBI review of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair — or if it is granted the highest right in spite of credible charges of aggression and unfair evidence?
And above all, will we vote during the mid-election of a Congress that will put Trump in charge?
If we do not make those tests, democracy will be facing a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the experiences I got in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me off to light the lamp on the table with the hook.
With such an inheritance, how can I be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic before the Rapid Vienna meeting
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, in the certainty of winning over the Austrians after the impressive unresolved struggle in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A broken obstacle to the middle track playing Graham Dorrans in making his first performance for the season in the unresolved 2-2 fight against Villareal, but he thinks Rangers can use the result as a jumpboard to get bigger things.
"It was a good point for us since Villareal is a good team," said the 31st.
"We went into the game and thought we could get something and got a point with us.
Maybe we could've done nothing at the end, but it wasn't necessarily a good result.
They were probably better in the first round, and we came out in the second round and it was the best team.
On Thursday, it will be a big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last fight, but with a home audience in my back I'm sure we can stand on and get a positive result.
The spring was absolutely damp, between everything that happened to my damage and the replacements in the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team's good and the boys are good; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand now, add the last season behind us and get it added."
Women lose their nighttime sleep due to fear of retirement
Although the participants in the study had a clear outline of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to the family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to the spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
‘People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they do nothing to take that call,’ said Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not say what you want in good time in advance.
Discussions with the consultant and the family where and how care should be given. Such choices may have a major role in determining the costs.
Take your economic advisor: The advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for the expenses.
The financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Develop your legal documents: Remove legal problems at the same time.
Get a health authority in place by appointing a person you trust to have an overview of your medical care, and make sure that health workers will comply with your wishes if you are to be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving some authority over your economy.
You choose a reliable person to make economic decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you cannot do it yourself.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Would you like to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Enter the details in a list so that you can prepare.
"It is not just the economy that is at stake – who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
‘What medicines do you need?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that list in place’.

The victim, a man in the '40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police Officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an "uninhibited action".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life threatening, and the police have demanded witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and death figures are expected to rise.
The communication is out of operation, and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from the Dongala Regent, a region north of Palu, which is located near the epicenter for the earthquake of 7,5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongalla on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrates 40-year-old anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongåla is a regent that extends over 300 km with a coastline in the north-west part of the island of Sulawesi.
The region under the province level had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the economics of the Central Province of Sulawesis, in particular the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Emergency Assistance Administration.
In 1938, more than 200 people killed a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit West Dongala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is on the Seismic Fire in the Pacific and is regularly framed by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of the north coast of the Indonesian Aceh province of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 hits south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island and triggers a tsunami that hit the south coast. Nearly 700 were killed.
2009: An earthquake with a force of 7,6 occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of 7,5 hit one of Mentawai's islands, outside Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters that razed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A green earthquake struck the regent Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while people were reminded of the reigns of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by matching buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquake is the focus of Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and kills more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and led to the temporary beaching of thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaskan governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested after charges of assault.
Palin, 29 years from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, closure with a report on domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State police.
According to the police report, he must have received the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged offense.
Palin will be imprisoned in Mat-Su and arrested for an uncertain debt of $500, reported by KTUU.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, absolutely" when he was asked how he was asked about the debt issue, the network reported.
Palin is confronted with three offences of Class A, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been accused of a Class B offence, which can be punished with one day in prison and a fine of $2000.
It's not the first time there's been an intention against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with violating his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is brought to Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was targeted for domestic violence, closed with the report on domestic violence and to hold a weapon while he was injured in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunamis: more than a hundred deaths
At least 384 people are killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of 7,5 triggered a tsunami and destroyed many thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and death figures are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck at the central Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulated on social media showing the outbreak.
Several hundred people were gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami sank inside the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek death penalty for suspected terrorist rape in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terrorist rapist in New York who killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been practised in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he was allowed down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutor must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims ‘suddenly’ and caused serious bodily harm, according to a warning of the intention to seek a death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for possible death penalty, according to the file.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury dropped the 22-point sentence, with eight intents for killing in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and an intention for the violence and theft of vehicles.
The attack called for ‘significant planning and intention’, said the actor, who described how Saipov carried it out as ‘saint, dirt and dirt’.
«Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal damage, property and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco», states the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the South District of New York brought a death penalty.
Khalid Barnes was sentenced to murder two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
Last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York, in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being sentenced for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenberg pair was executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no indication in the days and months after the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the investigators that he was happy for what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on the mobile, according to the target.
He also asked to hang up the ISIS flag in the hospital room, the police said.
He didn't make himself guilty after the 22nd sentence.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed defenders of Saipov, said that they were ‘openly disappointed’ over the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to apply for a death penalty instead of accepting a confession and a lifetime in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the traumas of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the authorities not to apply for a death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be given responsibility for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the people's army" today during a demonstration at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said that the politicians would be "smoothed" by the Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he be held responsible for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom “ville had been evicted” now if Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge for May to send his deeply divided ranks, has been underlined by pro-Remain Tories who participated in a own demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Minister of State fights to keep the Brexit plan on track against attacks by Brexitiers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the withdrawal – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Bone told the "Reporting" demonstrations in Solihul that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and had responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will stand for Brexit, but we must reject the Brexit plan".
When explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in two world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone denied claims that the referendum had changed since the vote in 2016: ‘The argument that the British people have changed their mind and wish to remain in the EU is totally wrong’.
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyn also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: “I simply say: Minister of State, listen to the people.
"The Brexit plan is unpopular in the public, and the opposition will not vote for it, and it is unpopular in the party and in our activists, who are actually the ones who cross the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Discard the Brexit plan and start listening’.
In a direct message to May, she added: "Ministers of State retain the job when they keep their promises".
Farage stated that the politicians would be "insensitive to the pressure" if they were to betray the decision taken by the public vote in 2016.
"This is now about trust between us – the people – and those politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to let them know that they won't get away with it."
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We mobilize the armies of the people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest before we become an independent, self-regulatory, proud United Kingdom."
Imen's marcher Remainers through Birmingham before they had a two-hour political gathering in the center of the city.
A small amount of activists fanted with Tories Against Brexit banners after the group was launched this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis praised the conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app when the conference started.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a free friction limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
‘It is a complete danger.
There is nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren takes it seriously to sit as a presidential candidate
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider seriously to be a presidential candidate" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the democrat from Massachusetts was talking about the future during a council meeting in Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, re-elections in November against the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was the visa representative of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She's been central to the speculations if she's going to stand up to Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters, who had used the board format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she was planning to sit down as a presidential candidate.
Warren replied that it is time that “women come to Washington to fix our defective government, and it includes a woman at the top”.
Arrest after Sims from LSU was killed by shooting
The police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting episode as correcting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a news conference at 11.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
“Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and died as a result of it,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde grabbed in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene and had a gun with him. He admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without abstinence and put in custody by East Baton Rouge Parish politicians.
Sims was a two-metre high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 matches with 10 starts last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton looks into the world's title after the slogans give him the sailor over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stable order would play a great role in the course.
From pole got a good start and fed almost Hamilton of the track while he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and Lot Hamilton continued to run in the back of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pit stop a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some push with the wheels that made the Ferrari's reluctant fate inside be free after a double passage to defend himself in a third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and entered as point seven at the end of the first round of his 21st anniversary.
Then he led in large parts of the course as he lay on the wheels to try to get to a quick finish and master Kimi Raikkonen who lay as number four.
He finally entered the 44th round depot, but failed to increase the pace of the remaining eight rounds and the Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me go.
The team has done a fabulous job to get a good top," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump hunted Senator Diane Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her detention that she did not play the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the highest-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
When the president spoke during an event in West Virginia, he did not refer directly to Ford's testimony in front of the Senate's judicial committee.
“The only thing that could happen and the pleasant thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are sad and bad and feel and talk nonsense,” he said.
"When you look at deliveries and toys, they say, "Oh, I haven't done it.
I have not done it».»
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you played?
Do you remember the answer to her... you played the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not played».»
Hey, wait a minute.
We played... no, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was played earlier in September--but Feinstein refused to have the leak come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't play her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as she asked for."
But her refusal was not taken lightly by the president, who, during the party event on Saturday evening, commented: "I must tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defence of the highest right candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president indicated that the Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
‘They have decided to withdraw the power by all necessary means.
You see the madness, the wickedness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to cross to get the power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer got two targets for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League losing against Belfast Giants by winning the return campaign 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants received a two-way tour through shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie compensated for the homestead before Dwyer restored the management of Giants.
Francois Bouchard offset for Dundee before two targets of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the winner.
It was the third Elite League loss for Adam Keef's men, who had come back after the blow of Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the third session of the season between the teams, and Giants had won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaul, and David Rutherford released the game when Beauvillier doubled management four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan returned home in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt went up to the Crown's equation at 15:16.
Dwyer assured that Giants had the management at break when he took his second target for the night at the end of the first round.
The homestead regrouped and Bouchard again matched once again with a lucrative goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran went together to help Nielsen to give Dundee leadership for the first time during the fight late in the second round, and he secured the sailor with his team's women halfway out in the end.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play home against Milton Keynes in their next fight on Friday.
Air traffic controllers die to ensure that several hundred air passengers escape the earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia is hailed as just after he died and made sure that a plane that had many hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a strong earthquake hit the island of Sulavesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had fled for life, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Aggung refused to leave his post in the heavily waving check tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He was going to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway just then, could safely ease.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died in a hospital later.
Speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We cleared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts burst when we heard it," he added.
The authorities fear that the death figures may rise to several thousand, and the disaster preparedness body of the country reports limited access to the towns of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong.
‘The numbers are expected to rise further since many equal are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been able to reach,’ said the spokesperson for the body Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have razed Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aeroplanes bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “All the time you see ambulances that are all gone.
There is a lack of clean water.
The retail markets are being hit everywhere.’
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "Indonesian Red Cross works febrile to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you clear?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Flying crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after flying crash in the lagoon
The airline that owns the plane as crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific, Micronesia, now says that one man is missing, and they previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that on Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they did not have an overview of.
The airline said they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and the crew after the plane hit the water while they tried to land on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and the condition of all was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was bombed on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others were able to swim through the deep water to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the pilots were panicking and screaming, and he got a smaller head injury.
U.S. Navy said sailors who worked nearby to repair a bridge, also helped in the rescue by using a breathable boat to transport people in the country before the plane fell about 30 metres below the water surface.
Aviation Safety Network data suggests that 111 people have died in a crash with PNG-registered planes in the last 20 years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analysts present the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The contracting authorities concluded the procedure on Saturday in a new case for a man charged with burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
USA Analysts in the Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phones to push the movements together to 29 years old named Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he picked up location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night she died, fighting against what he had claimed earlier, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as the cell phone of Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went into the witness box on Saturday and claimed he wasn't in town that day.
When the actor asked if Tellis was speaking the truth when he claimed he was in the trailer to Sanford that night, Sanford said he was "slow because my trailer was in Nashville".
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile printing suggests that they only knew each other in one week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers died, deleted Tellis' call, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defence shall, as planned, begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be left to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a society-gassed hip hop?
A hip hop-trio wants to challenge the negative image to the singer by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from origin with political messages to addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make community-based hip jump popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Commons have experienced a new boom in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Child-passenger in New York sues couples for termination after a "racist" message
A New York child-career seeks a couple of discriminatory dismissals after receiving a wrong message from her mother, who complained that she was “one black person”.
The couple rejects that they are racist and compares the case with ‘expressing’.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a stepmother, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new baby passenger, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up to the first working day of 2016.
‘NEEEEEEILE END A SVART PERSON’, Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the loss, it was a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman who said up Maurice, claiming that their declared child passenger, who was African American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her one working day and was then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the cancellation and requires compensation in the order of $350 per day for the six-month losi-based arrangement she was promised, but without contract.
“I would show them that – hey, that’s not what you’re doing,” she said to New York Post on Friday, and added, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have turned back against the charges that they are racist and say the abolition of Maurice was the only right thing, since they did not feel they could trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said the man Joel Plasco to New York Post.
"But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even though it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come on, come on.
The comparison of the case with "expressing" says Plasco was due to the fact that his wife had only two months to date and was in a «very difficult situation».
‘Is it such a person you want to punish?
It is not particularly fine," added the stock exchanger.
While the legal case is going on, the public court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticise them for their behaviour and attitudes.
The publisher of Paddington feared that readers would not accept a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was adopted, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the other place when they read it for the first time before it was issued.
It is very funny to know what we now know about the great success of Paddington."
She says that the father, who had worked as a cameraman in BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book of a small dressmaker, would have been very pleased that his work had been turned down. She added that the 60-year-old bookstore was "bitter-sweet" after he left last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important family member” and adds that her father was in secret very proud of the success he had achieved.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he was no weird person," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child making a treat: you are proud of it even though it is not your fault.
I think he considered Paddington's success a little bit like that.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to honor Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to the phone
At landing, the daughter had been rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors were given the job to save her life.
"Now called regularly to say that it was so bad that he didn't think she would survive," said Ednan-Laperous.
"So I got the phone from Nad who said she came to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so glad of you, my friend.
I'll be right back to you.
I'm coming to you.
The doctors had given her to get her heart to beat, lost slowly her effect and left the system.
She died a while ago, and the organs in her body fell together.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't celebrate and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together."
At last, Ednan-Laperous, who was now taking care of the daughter's loss, went on board the plane with the other passengers – who did not know if she had passed the tests.
"No one knew," she says.
«I looked down all the time and the tears ran in an even stream.
It's hard to explain, but there was on the plane I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards with grieving women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted a postcard to a brother in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers can call to get help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 years old when he was struck by depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to experience what I have to experience every day," she says.
45 years old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that the son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him in the smile.
They said that his smile could light up any room."
He ended up at work before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was one of those who found him after he took his life.
Sharon says, "I worry all the time that it's gonna be an infection."
Sharon added the cards “to tell people that there are people out there as they can go and talk to, even if there is only a friend.
Don't sit down for yourself - you have to talk to someone."
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, the partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he felt down or depressed or something," she says.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed the changed mood.
On 1st Christmas, he was in the cellar – when the kids opened the Christmas gifts, they did not get eye contact or anything.”
She says his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to fight through it: "It breaks up a big hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to stand out and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts checking
"I thought that if we could get some of what he asked – a time- and scale-limited review – we might be able to reach a certain agreement," said Flake on Saturday, and he added that he was afraid that the committee fell from each other along the fixed party boundaries.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican support players want the FBI to examine?
The motive was due to the timing.
The mid-elections are only five weeks away, 6 November – if the Republicans are likely to do so badly, it will be considerably more difficult for them to get the man they want chosen for the highest right in the country.
George W. Bush has called the senators and operated lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was personally secretary for Bush.
What happens after the FBI has delivered its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, so that Vice President Mike Pence can use his double vote and get him to the highest level.
Number of North Korean drop-offers under Kim
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korea Collection Department, said it had been 1127 discounts last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices of human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Most of North Korean refugees are offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of the flights through China, which have the longest border to North Korea, are easier to cross than the strictly watched demilitarized zone between the two Korean countries.
China treats the fugitives as illegal migrants, not refugees, and returns them with power.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still at war, has improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for talks on the final negotiations on denuclearisation.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no possibility that we will unilaterally move down first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's unfit to sit in the highest right
Minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the highest-right candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit in the highest-right.
Pelosi came with the opinions in an interview on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could only think that if a woman had acted like this, she would be called hysterical," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh condemned the feeling that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, including nearly crying and crying when he talked about the family and the years ahead.
He was also strongly condemning the Democrats in the Committee and calling the claims against him a "grotic and coordinated character trap" organised by liberals who were afraid that Hillary Clinton would lose the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he could not sit in the highest court since it showed that he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with such opinions and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi was touched when she was asked if she would try to put Kavanaugh to the throne if he was approved and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say this – if he does not tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he is not only unfit to sit in the highest right, but also in the right that he is sitting now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abort rights), since he was considered a conservative judge.
In the question, Kavanaugh asked whether he would review certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time to send a hysterical, partial person to the highest right and expect us to applaud it," said Pelosi.
And women have to handle it.
It's a fair grief, months and years where the mind takes over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're thirsty," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so nice, do you?"
She continues: "I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she was also crying when she was angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she was angry and started to cry, she told the person she was talking to "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm crazy."
And then she just kept going.
And that seemed to me to be amazing."
Tears are allowed as an end to the pain in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs was in a man-dominated office. I started crying with inexplicable rage and was caught in the back of an older woman – a cool boss I had always been a little scared of – who led me to a staircase.
"Let them never see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They will think you're sorry and be happy because they were able to take you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Hart was discovered to be disloyal to the husband on board a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Schroeder was very frustrated and thought that there was nothing in the way to investigate the possibilities of putting himself as a presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a deliberate decision," she said with a smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was one more.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
Since it was the end of the campaign, she left with the funding and the swearing that she wouldn't stop if she didn't get $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She found out that some of the support players who gave $1,000 to men gave her just $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount, or?" she wonders.
When she kept the speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to drive money and reach voters instead of delegates, and mind about sexism – that she fell together in tears.
"You would think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls how the press described her.
"You should think that Kleinex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking that I believed what they would write on my grave support?
'She cries?'
How the US-China Trade Wars Can Win Beijing
The opening waves of the US-China trade war were exhilarating, and even if the fight is far from over, a ruff between the countries may be favourable to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, launched the first warning earlier this year by adding customs to important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The main escalation took place this week with new rates of customs on goods worth $200 billion, which means customs on half of all goods imported into the USA from China.
Beijing has, of course, recovered every time, now at the latest with a five to ten percent attack on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match the US attack, and the world's next largest economy will probably not lift the white flag with the first.
To get Washington to step down means to provide for demands, but public submission to the United States will be too humiliating for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its shorts correctly, the pressure around the US trade war can provide a positive statement for China in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that trigger economic shocks in one of the countries is in fact much more dangerous than the spectators have realized in the past," said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria “clear” for return of refugees, Minister of Foreign Affairs says
Syria says they are ready for voluntary return of refugees and appeal for help to return to the country, which has been razed after more than 7 years of war.
When he spoke at the United Nations National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he says.
The State continues to build again areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All the facts are now ready for voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and bread.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million acid have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the damaged country.
However, he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from countries that were in need of assistance would not be accepted.
Europe ensures Ryder Cup matches in Paris
Team Europe has won 2018 Ryder Cup after hitting Team USA with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times each other on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe resumed the throne when the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn received the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who was all under much of the tournament, drew his tea-screw in the water at a couple of three to 16 holes, and had to see herself turned off by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant in all his rounds and became 1 of 4 golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was turned off 5 and 4 of the lowest ranking player on the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranking player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup finals.
With all eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most winning Europeans of the tournament over the years with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't leave.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas picked me out and had faith in me.
I'm very, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," said an emotional Garcia after the European winner.
He leaves the sticker to his countryman John Ram, who beat the American golfing Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a single game on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods – I followed that man closely in the growth," said 23 years old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a registration of 13-21-3 career points in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics for one of the biggest golfers ever, who have won 14 major titles, just turned off Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA all weekend by finding the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
U.S. law captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing performance for his troops, "I am proud of these figures, they fought.
That was the moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves out.
Hated by Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of the players played very well.
We want to regroup, I want to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and I want to look forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their team captain.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were hit."
