New issues on the California Water Supply Project
Critics and state legislators say that they want to know more about who pays for a 16 billion US dollars-deserved project supported by Governor Jerry Brown, according to the California Water Supply Administration's leading representative, that the Brown administration is offering government funding to complete the construction of two huge water tunnels.
Critics claim that the government’s funding described by the Los Angeles Metropolitan Water Supply Administration may conflict with the state’s long-standing claims that different local water supply administrations, not California itself, would pay for Brown’s vision to extract two equal 35-year-old tunnels to bring water to the south of the Sacramento River, mainly Central and Southern California.
The initial expenditure for the construction of tunnels of US$ 248 million, which is still to be authorised by the supervisory authority, has already been launched by the Federal Audit Research Centre.
On Wednesday, state legislators also ordered a state audit on the construction of tunnels.
On Thursday, State Speaker Nensija Vogel said that, despite the Los Angeles Metropolitan Water Supply Management Account, no money will be used to complete the current planning phase of the dual tunnels from the state's general budget.
However, tunnel opponents and a group of taxpayers were critical on Thursday, and the representative of the Assembly, Susan Ega, one of the state legislators of the audit ordered this week, asked the state for explanations on Thursday.
"It is a game of shopping stones," said David Wolfs, Legal Director of the Howard Jervis Tax Association.
In my view, this is a matter of yesterday's audit (a request): there are many more questions than answers.
The tunnel project has been approved by Brown and some politically influential water and water consumers in Central and South California.
Supporters claim that tunnels will benefit the environment and provide California with safer water supply.
The opponents claim that they are concerned that the state will use tunnels to channel too much water from the Sacramento River and the San Francisco Bay, causing damage to Northern California and further endangering local species.
Metropolis and other water supply administrations intended to receive water from tunnels still have to be committed to paying for their insecurity because of the fact that the investment of large resources will really provide enough water to repay it.
The same water supply administrations also announced this year that they will not be paid for the completion of the current preparatory work unless the project is first authorised by the supervisory authority.
On Thursday, the monthly report on the draft tunnels published by the Los Angeles Water Supply Administration states that "the Fund has indicated that additional funding for the completion of the planning phase will be granted from state or federal budget."
After all that local water supply administrations have spent on the project, including 63 million US dollars from their water supply management, "is expected," the state will use national money to complete planning," said Bob Muirs, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles water supply management.
He sent questions to Vogel, the state chief.
Vogela said that the state is planning to allocate money for the completion of the planning of tunnels at the cost of the existing half-century old water network, the State Water Project.
The opponents of tunnel construction, however, point to the regulatory regulation issued in 2009, which, they say, prevents the state from spending money on tunnel construction until the water supply authorities that benefit from it are bound by payment obligations for them.
"The project contractors have promised to pay for this project, and they have used financial tricks to cover these commitments," said Patrícia Šiferle, environmental consultant and former planned tunnel opponent.
This raises questions about where this money was found.
Addressing a business group under the Chinese Cybersecurity Act
A coalition of international business groups has addressed China with a request to change the proposed cybersecurity rules by warning that they will harm trade and the State in isolation.
The letter to the Chinese Prime Minister Li Kecjan has signed 46 groups from the USA, Europe, Asia and Latin America, expressing global concern that the rules could restrict or suspend access to the market for Chinese security products.
Among the signatories are the US Chamber of Commerce, the European Services Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed rules require suppliers to show the Chinese authorities how security products work and how information about Chinese citizens will be stored in the country.
The last letter, dated Wednesday, said that this data loss could make it easier and reduce access to Chinese customers.
Chemical explosion in Tianjin: a year since the tragedy
Zhang Mengfan claims that the company has earned to know what happened in Tianjin.
Chinese leaders plan silent reminders to mention a large - scale chemical explosion that killed 173 people on the first anniversary, but not all agree.
John Sadworth reports from Tianjin.
Almost anywhere in the world would be the anniversary of such a disaster at a time that the people remember and remember.
But not in China.
While a memorial service for the memory of some dead firefighters is held in the town of Tajin, such reminders are excluded.
The media controlled by the Communist Party have been told what they can and cannot say, and some survivors as well as family members are warned not to talk to foreign press.
However, 23 years old Zhangs Mengfans do not want to be silent.
"This year's society should know something about what happened," he tells me.
I don't want silence.
On 12 August last year, Zhangs was a radio operator in the military fire-fighting brigade that was only a mile away from the explosions at the epicenter.
"The call was received yesterday at 22.53, and we started sending my team members," he says.
Instead, they could arrive within 10 minutes.
The burning of large fires in the chemical warehouse also rushed teams from other places in the city.
None of them drew attention to the fact that a large quantity of volatile and toxic substances was illegally stored, with a sharper than the permitted quantities and without proper supervision.
The fire started when it was allowed to make nitrocelluloses - chemicals used in nail polishing - the lot is chewing and then the summer burns.
Then it spread in a huge area - 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertiliser.
There were windows and fire extinguishers, where Zhangs Mengfans waited for news from the scene on the radio.
This information was not received either.
"When I saw the fairy tale, I fell into delusion," he told me.
I knew what that meant to my friends.
Of the 26 fire extinguishers who were sent to the blast site at that time, eight of his units never returned.
Many others suffered serious burns and other injuries.
Most of the two major explosions were compared to an earthquake, and the blast wave was felt many miles away.
The total loss is estimated at more than US$ 1 billion, including more than 300 damaged buildings.
Overall, 173 people were killed, 104 of whom were firefighters.
The remains of eight people have not been found.
The authorities of the official government investigation are guilty of corruption, political ties and formal secret agreements, which have allowed for circumvention of the rules and for ignoring security systems.
First of all, such a warehouse should never have been built near the home.
More than 100 officials and company management officials have initiated some kind of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
Thus, as long as the government can point to the progress made - thousands of houses and compensations to the population, these sensitive issues remain up to date.
Tragedy has been discovered in a system of shocks where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent supervision is a fact.
The courage and duty of the evening is not questionable, yet without a fire extinguisher as a hero’s image, the scene is not entirely pleasant.
It contains a fire extinguisher as a victim who was sent without a hint to fight a man’s disaster that could have been prevented.
Zhangs Mengfan no longer works in the fire department, but will visit the memory of the service in Tianjin.
He will carry the message of his loved ones who have died.
Mostly I would like to say to them, I have visited your parents and they are doing well.
Leave your parents to me.
Now I'm a member of your family.
I will fulfill your duties as a son.
Cold spring could affect the Scottish ruby shooting season
Scotland's rubbing season will start later, as the number of birds has decreased this year because of the cold weather.
Shooting in several properties has been delayed, as many of the new rubies have not survived in cold weather.
Marking the beginning of the season, the Association of Scottish Players (SGA) announced that the shooting of rubles provides more work than the Edinburgh Festival.
However, the OneKind Animal Welfare Fund calls for the end of the "brutal killing of birds".
The director of the organisation, Harry Hutton, said: "The work that is invested in the provision of large numbers of birds to shoot is enormous and unrelentingly involved in all controversial activities."
There is no surprise that society is avoiding this so-called sport and calls on the government to ban the unwanted, unnecessary occupation enjoyed by only a very small part of the people of Scotland.
Landowners, however, insist that they undertake to preserve the number of birds and that the shooting of rubella is important for rural economic development.
SGA President Alex Hogs said that the sector provides 8 800 full-time jobs in the less-favoured regions of the year and that it has been a 'rich job drop' in uncertain times.
He said, "As compared with many European countries, in Scotland, the culture of "weeding" has not been so much encouraged, and some people do not know how the shooting season affects the country in terms of economics."
Hogs said that the number of jobs provided during the shooting exceeded the number of jobs created at the Edinburgh International Festival, Fringe Festival, the Festival of Festivals and the Old Ages together.
He added: "The employment situation in Scotland is currently quite worrying, especially in the oil and gas sector, so game managers and their families want to see the sector’s prosperity.
We want to work with the Scottish Government to ensure that those who work hard can rely on these jobs in the future as well.
RSPB Scotland considers that at least eight golden eagles have been killed near the ruby habitat.
Many game organizers acknowledge that rubbing is not generally popular, but SGA claims that the industry "has taken significant steps forward in terms of best practice."
The opening day of the Ruben shooting season is traditionally known as the "Holy Twelfth."
However, there is still much discussion about this sport, and the management of the rubble shooting sites is related to the persecution of some of the offenders by the nature conservation authorities.
On Thursday, RSPB Scotland said that during less than five years in the Monadliat Mountains, in the southeastern part of the Invernes, eight golden eagles were missing.
The Natural Welfare Fund considers that they have been illegally killed near the rubble shooting sites and their satellite a process has been destroyed.
Scotland's Environment Minister Rosana Kaningema said that these reports are "very disturbing and sad."
Ms Kaningema asked officials to analyse evidence of approximately 90 survivors and missing eagles with transmitters to determine whether there was a trend in criminal activities.
The Scottish cleanup group blames the RSPB for trying to detect the anti-fouling feelings before the beginning of the rubbing season, and also mentioned that there is no clear evidence that the birds had even been killed in the vicinity of the Monadlit Mountains.
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Briony Pejža Great Britain pours silver in the trampline
United Kingdom representative Peedža cut silver in the trampline
Briony Peigga became the first British woman to come to the Olympics in the trampline game in Rio.
Peiži (25) to gold lacks 0.425 points, as Canada's representative Rosanna Maklena has already won the second Olympic title in a row with a result of 56,465.
The world champion, the Chinese representative of Lī Dana, was at the bronze, while the second British finalist, Katrina Driscola, finished her sixth.
I can't believe I fought the Olympic medal.
I am so happy," said the emotional Paige.
I did not feel that it was a medal, but the ability to show the best performance, so I was so happy that all the training and hard work had been paid back.
I'm so happy that I could start at the end with Kata, already the participation of one representative at the end would be historic, but we were there two.
Prior to the Olympic Silver Championship, Peigga’s highest achievement in international competitions was the fifth place in the 2015 World Championship in Denmark.
Tramplining in the Olympics was included in 2000 and this is the first time British women have managed to get to the finish.
Medal reaction.
The British team's representative Nathan Beilis, the only representative of men in the race on Saturday, was in ecstasy.
Hanna Velana, who takes part in the Olympics the second time, quickly began to celebrate the success of Paige.
Peiža has gained a bachelor's degree in biology with excellence at the University of Shefyldas.
Rio 2016: Fiji fans lead gold medal fight in regbi-7
12-year-old boy to watch the game, watch half the javelin in the fields of sugarcane to the nearest TV
Fidji, after its history, begins the first Olympic gold medal contests of an unprecedented scale
Banks closed, shoplifted, and holidaymakers took over Suva streets, dancing, singing, singing and cheering
Fiji won a gold medal at the Deodoro Stadium at the 7 final with 43-7 killing Great Britain.
Thousands of people throughout the island stopped their normal activities to watch the historic game.
Fiji Holidays in its history of the first Olympic medal
Many fellow believers were wearing Fiji’s colors and looking after the cracks, wearing the national flag, and encouraging the team.
When playing the final swing, excited fans went to the streets, licking and dancing.
"Some people even stopped their vehicles on the streets of Suva and joined in celebrations with Fiji flags that did not address the small congestiveness they created," reports Fiji Times.
It will certainly continue at the end of the week and the following week.
Irish Prime Minister: Finn Harps 0-5 Derry City
Arons Makenefs entered two first half-time sentences in favour of the Finnish police.
Derry City has risen to the second Prime Minister, winning a convincing victory with the result of a 5-0 fight with Finn Harps.
Arons Makenefs pointed out "confection strips" in the successful implementation of two first half-time sentences, which were awarded for violations against Lucas Šübert.
Nathan Boil entered the gates at the beginning of the second half, and Šübert was able to force the enemy in the fourth quarter before the attack of Kitta Varda, closing the enemy's funeral in Finnpark.
Derry is one point ahead of Cork City, and both teams will be in the decisive game on Monday evening in Brendville.
It was Derry's first victory over his North-West competitors in the season, and they disturbed me on the part of the HARPS.
Makenef saved the game in 17 minutes after Kiran Kola left for Sübert, even though the offense turned out to be outside the court.
There was no doubt about the second sentence, the former "Karameleus Strip" semi-sguard Bari Molo, making Schübert fall to the ground and Makenef score in the third minute after the break.
Boil added a precise point after Din Gervis's game with a foot within the eighth minute after the game began.
Derry City Guard Gerard Doherti had a good evening, but he managed to protect the gates perfectly, overcoming David Skalli in the best opening of the game.
Sübert cut the ball long before Colam was exhausted in 83 minutes, and soon Varda’s wisdom came to light over the protector Richard Brass of the Harps Center.
It was Derry's biggest winning game in the series and a great preparation for the final game with Cork.
Test for mass unordered tests in the course of the University of Highlands and Islands (UHI)
All 20 students could have been expelled from the Inverness College at UHI's highest media course.
Most of them were 17 - and 18 - year - old students who expected to use their study notes to attend the university.
The Inverness College UHI argues that quality assurance processes are being applied, adding that the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) investigates this case.
The SQA Press Secretary said that the highest media assessment available throughout the country in 2016 was "as planned".
Twenty students enrolled at the offered and rated course of the Inverness College UHI.
Many of the students were young people living in rural areas who were learning online, but they often had to go to Inverness Colleges from their homes, such as Locheiber.
One student’s father said that after his daughter’s publications on social media that she had not received any evaluation for her work, at least 10 also reported that she had received no evaluation of her course work.
He told BBC News Scotland that about five more people who took this course at the Inverness College last year and who managed to get in touch with it said that the same thing happened to them.
The situation means that her daughter cannot provide a place at the University of Glázgova, but she will be able to accept another university offer thanks to the qualifications obtained at school.
However, her father said that there were also others who attended a college-organized media course that did not take place and who were now in "forgetting" and insecurity about whether their work would be reviewed and evaluated with a view to entering universities.
Inverness College UHI is part of the University of Uppers and Islands.
Diāna Rovlinson, Head of the UHI College of Winters and Executive Director, said: "Our exam results and student success are very important."
This is also confirmed by the excellent review of her Master's Education Inspectorate (HMIE) received this year, as well as by the improved levels of achievement in both education and higher education over the past year.
As we have done every year, we will review all the results published, comparing them to those predicted by each student.
In the case of this particular course, standard quality assurance measures were carried out and the evaluation authority recently reported "essential improvements in the provision and management of this assessment" and confirmed that "evaluations were consistent with national standards."
SQA is currently investigating this case at our request.
The SQA Press Secretary said, "We are pleased that the highest media assessment in 2016 has taken place as planned and that candidates had the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject."
Many candidates have shown good performance and there was a slight increase in the A-C performance rate compared to the same qualification last year.
It was developed in accordance with previous and model documents and in accordance with our course and assessment specifications.
Brothers in prison for samurai's teeth "inhaled" in Kilmarnok
Jason Braidena was attacked with samurai teeth, Nazis and nuns
Two brothers were imprisoned in prison for killing a man with a samurai tooth after drug-related beatings in Airshira, which was evaluated as "inspiring".
The victim Jason Bradens (38) was found in his home in Kilmarnok on July 5, 2015.
At the Supreme Court in Glázgov James Clark (36), at least 22 years of imprisonment will be brought.
His brother, John (38), was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being sentenced to less severe charges of murder without prior payment.
By forcing both men to prison, Judge Bill Danlops told the brothers that they had made a "unfortunate, cruel and savage attack."
He rejected any assumption that Mr. Braden had slept and waited for them, armed with a samurai tooth.
Justice Danlops added: "You are planning an illegal entry together with at least one Nazi and the missing."
Jason Bradens may also have been a drug dealer, but he was a son, a father, and a friend.
You put him down.
After the two men were imprisoned in prison, the criminal police inspector who conducted the investigation said, "John and James Clark's violent and horrible action has resulted in Jason Braden's death."
Getting into the world at 38 years of age is a heart - to - heart situation for the family to survive.
The court had previously heard that the brothers from Kilmarnok had decided to seize Mr. Braden’s golden attitude, which they had given him in exchange for drugs.
Both alcohol and drugs went to his house, rubbed their faces with scarves, and armed with noses and Eastern combat rats.
It is considered that the tooth used in the slaughter belonged to the deceased.
The neighbors said that they saw Clarke shoot Braden when he sat on the couch at the window and heard his scream.
Prosecutor Richard Godards at the courtroom said, "The assault on this man was sustained, chaotic."
Thereafter, the place of slaughter was described as "drinked".
In addition to the injuries from the nail holes during the Braiden attack, he suffered a severe trauma with a dirty object.
Three days later he died at Kilmarnoka Kroshaus hospital.
Both brothers do not confess to murder.
Giving evidence, James Clarks, who had been tried 38 times before, including a murder attempt, said, "I didn't want it. It was an accident."
John Clark, who has been tried 23 times, said that he was just involved in helping a brother who, according to him, attacked Braden."
A man is sentenced to imprisonment for cutting and killing his baby’s son
David Sinclair acknowledged his guilt in the murder of a child in his home in East Kilbraid in 2012.
A man who was beaten and killed by an angry rage of his childhood children because he did not want to eat was sentenced to seven years and three months of imprisonment.
David Sinclair cut four months old Josh when he "lost control at the moment" at his home in East Kilbraid, South Lancashire, on December 6, 2012.
The cause of death was identified only after judicial medical examination.
Sinclair (34) was initially accused of murder but was found guilty of murder without prior payment.
In the Supreme Court of Glázgova, indicting him in prison, Judge Lord Briesidls Sinclair said: "You assault your baby's son by cutting him up by causing the injuries he's dying of."
When you cut her, you needed to know, but you didn't.
Only after thorough medical examinations you will know what you have done.
Your wife believed you.
Now his feelings have been transferred and you can no longer be supported.
Lord Bressidles described the effects of Josh's death as "catastrophes" for everyone and added, "Nothing will return to Josh."
The court had previously found that on the day that the child died, Sinclair and his wife, Kersty, had gone to swim with Joshua and to buy a pair of shoes.
At 5:30 p.m., Kersty Sinclair went to meet his mother and sister.
Only 11 minutes later, she was summoned by Sinclair, who heard "shocked."
He said to her, "Joshua doesn't breathe like he's coming. He's coming home right now."
Then he ended the conversation and called for 999.
The baby was immediately taken to Hermira’s hospital, where she died.
Initially, Joshua’s cause of death was not clear, but he was viewed by a team of medical experts, who found that shortly before the effects of the trauma of death in the eyes and brains, and such traumas were not possible by accident.
One of the experts, Dr. Peter Richards, a neurosurgeon at the John Redcliffe Hospital in Oxford, said: "This has happened because the child has been tortured and thus has suffered injuries, as well as has been harassed with more force than daily."
The representative of the D.J. told the court that Sinclair was "extremely sorry".
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Chloe Tatone threatens the position of July Jefimova
To the representative of Britain Tatoni, out of the hands of bronze in the 200 m swimming
UK representative Chloe Tatone criticises the participation of the opponent-rated swimmer Julia Jefimova in Rio after the Russian representative rushes her 200 m in the swim.
Jefimova, who was allowed to participate in the games following the complaint about the prohibition of participation on the ground of doping, removed the silver by leaving Tatoni in the fourth place.
"I would have wanted them to be completely clean," said 20-year-old sailor.
I haven't already decided who's in there.
I'm not satisfied with it, but that's it.
Jefimova, who fought the second place, learned about his participation in the games only three days ago.
I don't want to see people get out of sports, but I don't think it's really right.
She was not supposed to participate in the competition, and the 20 - year - old British representative had to score a medal.
Rie Kaneto won Japan's seventh gold medal in 2016 in Rio, overcoming Jefimovu, who was at the gold medal.
China's representative Jinlinga This was at the bronze, only six hundred seconds after Tatoni's fourth remaining.
Her British teammate, 20-year-old Molly Rensov, finished her sixth.
"Remaining in the fourth place is a little hope, no matter what's ahead of you," Tatone added.
It's a great experience, and I'm a little confused about the fourth place.
I'm so close to the medal, and that would have been a dream.
However, meeting at the end is a great experience I will take with me in the years to come.
It was a little disappointment, but in the long run it will make me strong, and it will make me look more and more for the medal, so I'll probably get closer to it next time.
Tatone was only 0.01 seconds away from the British record at the end of the 200 m swim.
"Every person has to give a second chance," - Jefimova.
Jefimova, who said that she was already tired of answering questions about her doping past, defended her right to start Rio.
In 2013, she was banned for 16 months after anabolic steroid traces were found in her body.
The Sports Disciplinary Court (CAS) stated that athletes cannot be prevented from participating in Rio games because they have already been subject to sanctions.
CAS looked at my complaint, and I won.
If someone doesn't like it and there's another opinion, they can turn to CAS," she explained.
I don't support doping, and I've never used it.
In the second case, it was certainly not my fault.
Each person must be given a second opportunity.
When you go and you get the ticket, no one puts you in jail.
Bens Prauds removed the place for 50 free-style swimming
A British record was previously installed to fight the place for men 50 m of free-style swimming finals.
The distance of the Union champion Praud (21) was 21.54 seconds until the fifth highest qualified Friday final (02:44 BST Saturday).
Your delegation is harmless and ugly
Indian Sports Minister Vijays Goels Rio Olympics has been a very charming person, often held in the courts, encouraged Indian athletes and taken the selves after their beginnings.
However, he and his large company have apparently caused the anger of the Olympic game organizers due to their uncontrollable behavior, repeatedly trying to break out to the competition zones without adequate accreditation and rudely responding to the news agency Press Trust of India when tested.
Vijay Goels, photographed in July, justify his conduct.
Wednesday, the organizers of the Olympic Games threatened to cancel Goela’s accreditation if his behavior did not improve by sending a warning message after he and his company tried to enter restricted access areas at the venue and in the arena, where the event is held.
"We have received a number of reports that your sports minister has tried to enter the accredited competition zones with persons without accreditation," says the continental manager of the Sára Peterson, Rio 2016 organizer committee.
When the staff tried to explain that this was not allowed, the people who were with the minister became aggressive and rude, and sometimes they broke up with our staff.
"If our protocol team becomes aware of any other such behaviour, your sports minister's accreditation will be cancelled and his privileges in the Olympic Games will be cancelled," the letter continued.
The head of the Indian delegation referred to this case as "the bull's-frozen zilion", and Goels himself said that he had done nothing wrong by writing it all as "understanding".
On the tweet he wrote: "As far as I know, we have observed all the rules.
We support the spirit of the Olympics and our Indian athletes.
In other words, this Olympic game for India has all the fumes, there are no medals yet.
Hopeless fans in the social media pointed out that Michael Felps has won as many medals as India has in its history.
Several prominent candidates have already been excluded, including the shooter Abhinav Bindra, who won the gold medal in Beijing in 2008.
This time he left the fourth.
The wind is running money and opportunity," wrote the author and column author Shoba De in Sardinian poem.
However, there are still some strange hopes, as there will still be competitions in boxing, golf, tennis, light-yearing and, yes, cold-minding.
The only Indian winemaker, Dipa Karmakara, will arrive at the finals of the summer on the weekend, showing his terrible double-turn "Death wine", the "Prodova wine wine", which only some other winemakers have tried.
In a country where 1.25 billion people live, the low number of medals awarded in India has always been a cause for concern.
Analysts say it has countless reasons.
National anger is a cricket that is not an Olympic sport.
India has not made a significant contribution to infrastructure and Olympic training - Karmakar's first tool was prepared from the old ski spare parts.
Parents have always stressed the overriding of academic knowledge about sports.
And the authorities responsible for sports have been taken over by corruption.
The International Olympic Committee has represented the Indian Olympic Association for Violations of its Statutes in 2012, as it has elected leaders against whom criminal cases are proposed.
Sochos three members of the Indian Winter Olympics were even prevented from representing their country, carrying a flag or wearing any national symbol.
They meet as independent athletes.
When people get injuries, the turbulence cruise JetBlue plane route Boston-Sakramamento is forced to drop off in South Dakota.
The JetBlue aeroplane was forced to perform an emergency landing on Thursday evening after 22 passengers and two crew members were injured during turbulence, reports CBS Sacramento.
Travel 429 from Boston to Sacramento left in Rapids, South Dakota, just before 19:30 in the evening after the local time.
The airline reports that the injured have been transferred to the hospital for inspection.
JetBlue claims that it has sent personnel to help the injured, has banned the spare aircraft to deliver the other passengers to Sacramento.
The Agency for Drug Control (DEA) launches a long-term opportunity for medicated marijuana
Unfortunately, the answer is that there is little to believe.
This is a loss of opportunity which may cause even more delay in treatment for countless people.
To date, there is only one source of medical marijuana approved at the federal level at Mississippi University.
It seems to be a little more positive today that the DEA has also announced that it will now allow other places to apply for the same permit.
There is hope that the quantities and diversity of marijuana available for scientific purposes will be expanded.
Although this will focus on a good study, it will be symbolic to a large extent, regardless of how many marijuanas are available, if access to it is still difficult, it does not matter.
Imagine a product that is very required but is stored behind closed doors.
Responding to a request for a product which takes a difficult, understandable decision to produce it more, but never shuts the door.
This product is marijuana and its location on list 1 is the closed door.
In such an unpleasant situation, there is a medical marijuana.
Since marijuana is a substance listed in list 1 (respectively, as defined by the definition "not currently authorised medical use and there is high potential for its intended use"), there are significant barriers to the closure of the doors.
Potential researchers usually focus on DEA because it allows them to start scientific studies.
Even if authorisation is granted for the investigation of substances listed in list 1, the authorities must comply with very strict safety rules and must set up high-level safety systems, which may be costly.
There is also an even more subjective view of the authorisation of its academic authority to conduct first-order studies of substances included in list 1.
Even if certain faculty representatives wish to conduct this study, university management may not want problems or any possible side effects due to negative press reports.
This was the case at Arizona University when Dr. Søu Sisley was released from the post after an effort to advance medical marijuana trials.
Sisley finally sought private funding for his project, and only in April, seven years after the initial project was proposed, her project became the first medical marijuana attempt to prevent post-traumatic stress for veterans, approved by the DEA.
After years of fighting bureaucratic barriers, the National Institute for Drug Addictions has believed in the last key.
At present, it is the largest federal state funder of marijuana research and is the only provider of marijuana itself.
Even if a higher amount of medical medicine is available in free circulation, the Institute will still have to approve all its funded studies.
The problem, however, is, in its name, 'disuse'.
Dr. Donald Eibrams, representing the University of San Francisco, interviewed his documentary "Marihuāna", says that the main task of the Institute is to study substances in the context of their potential dependence, not as medications.
Ebram pays attention to an important fact.
Even if the study will overcome all the obstacles listed above, the door may still be closed if the intention is to study the benefits of medical marijuana rather than the damage it has caused.
Note: In a quick (and unscientific) search at the U.S. National Library of Medicine, 1,434 works on medical marijuana have been found in the last five years.
In the same search only 57 works were for the benefit of medical marijuana.
Most of the studies were about the harm done to marijuana, such as "Bad trip due to the anticholinergic effects of marijuana", "Marihuana caused by pancreatitis" and "The use of marijuana and the risk of lung cancer."
Such a disproportion creates a completely distorted view.
The way to the medical marijuana use is mixed with surprises and surprises, where the sight is open.
As long as the status of list 1 is present, without regard to the medical effect, the US Department of Health and Social Affairs maintains a wide range of canadione patents for medical purposes.
DEA continues to establish marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as a potential for high-dependence drugs, even though DEA’s own chief administrative justice, Francis Jangs, objected to it.
In medical terms, marijuana is safer than many widely consumed foods.
For example, 10 fresh potatoes may cause toxic reactions.
In comparison, it is physically impossible to eat so many marijuana in order to incur death.
Marihuana is in its natural form one of the safest therapeutic active substances known to man.
Reasonable analysis of marijuana may be safe to use in the treatment under appropriate supervision.
It must be said again that it was proposed by the DEA judge himself.
And yet, almost 30 years later, little has changed.
Whether we realize it or not, we all accept certain dosages in our daily lives.
Maybe we don't always have the energy to say it loud, or we're so stupid or we're so surprised that no one seems to notice it.
As far as the case is concerned in the context of federal medical marijuana policy, there must be a capacity to present facts without undue delay.
The lives of patients, such as Charlotte Fiji, whose attacks are reduced by medical marijuana, and many other lives depend on it.
The fact that the plant can do so much good and still be behind closed doors is worth talking at the highest level.
Bloody Beetroots: Donald Tramps "Blonde Berlusconi"
Bloody Beetroots is known in electronic dance music context
The musicians say that Trump dominates the media like Berlusconi
You know, we've been to Berlusconi in Italy, and Tramps looks like Blonde Berlusconi," the founder of the electronic music band "The Bloody Beetroots" told CNN.
The President of the Republic is a candidate and a politician, an Italian media magnet, both known for his fickle personalities, the ability to attract press attention and the media of changed stories.
"Bloody Beetroots" is known for its electronic dance music and has collaborated with various artists, starting with legendary Seru Polo Makartnija and ending with electropop singer Greta Svabo Becchi in 2013 in the song "Chronicles of a Fallen Love."
Rifo was born in the Italian city of Basano del Grapa, near Venice, in 1977, which is about parallel to the time of Pancrok’s birth, and the figures “1977” were placed on the chest for music.
"The English language is not my native language, so I don't understand everything about your world," Rifo said, hiding behind the black fee he is familiar with.
I am trying to explore, and I am trying to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifo invited Americans to watch the Video, a documentary film that explores Berlusconi's monopoly on Italian media.
The documentary is about how "Berlusconi made Italy a trak," said Rifo, adding that trampam had a similar effect on America.
"You see how a person can completely turn the system and displace everything... by his own," he said.
I don't think Trump's good in this country.
Two Turkish sailors imprisoned in a prison of more than 500 million pounds in the drug market
Two Turkish men were convicted of worth more than 500 million pounds of cocaine smuggling on a ship in the North Sea for at least 20 years in prison.
Mother Sahins and Emins Ozmens were found guilty after a trial in the Supreme Court in Glázgova after about 100 Jews from the Aberdina coast to the MV Hamal ship were found three tons of Class A drugs.
The detention in 2015 is one of the largest shipments of cocaine held in Europe at any time in the sea.
Maminas Sahinam and Eminam Ozmenas will be sentenced to imprisonment for his role in a large-scale drug deal
The cargo found on the ship is one of the largest in British history
Narcotics were found hidden in a specially installed hiding place on a trailer registered in Tanzania, which sailed from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea.
It was stopped by the British fleet frigate "HMS Somerset" and the border force shuttle "HMC Valiant".
Sahins (47) was sentenced to 22 years, while Ozmen (51) was sentenced to 20 years in the Supreme Court of Glasgow.
Justice Lord Kinkleeven's men said that the amount of drugs was "not only important but huge", and drug smuggling has a "grassy effect" on people and the surrounding society.
He said: "You have been involved in commercially in the most extensive operation, including the transport of cocaine by ships, in an operation that has crossed the international and truly cross-border borders."
He said that Captain Sahins was not "drug at the end of the tree", but he had had a significant role in the criminal offence, while the second Captain of Ozmen's role was "to some extent less".
The inspectors went up to Hamal's ship after collecting information from the French customs office DND, and when it arrived in Aberden, they rushed through the steel plate, accessing the secret compartment where 128 soldiers were found with cocaine with a weight of 3.2 tonnes, as the approximate value in the black market is 512 million barrels.
Last year, MV Hamal inspected the royal fleet.
There were three tons of cocaine on board.
During the examination of the vessels, it was found that its bulk containers contain a low volume of Class A drugs
The ship was on its way from the Bosphorus Sea narrow to South America before it was stopped in the North Sea.
Access to this site was opened under the cabinet in one of the crew's premises, and the hatch was cemented.
Sahins and Ozmen were found guilty of transporting and hiding cocaine on board from 20 February to 23 April last year, and of supplying cocaine between 21 April and 23 April.
Both uncondemned men who have worked in the shipping industry since the end of school continue to claim that they are not guilty, yet they accept the sworn judgment.
The charges against four other men are missing evidence.
Sahina's lawyer, Jonathan Kravs, said that a married father of two children is a "glorified mussel".
He said, "Someone involved in drug trafficking."
Someone who was able to run a ship.
Looking at the drug hierarchy, Sahins certainly does not have drugs at the bottom of the tree, but somewhere below.
Extensive quantity of cocaine on board means that it had to be replaced by a road crane
Police went through the entire ship for days before drugs were distributed through these boxes
To Sahina asked questions about his master's work on "Hamal" in February 2015, the court heard.
Mr Krova said that he was "shocked" about the long-term important events of daughter (9) and son (13) and "just want to go back to Turkey".
Both men have not seen their families since the arrest in April 2015, as families are still struggling to obtain visa approval.
Ozmena's lawyer Di Murs said that he "is sorry" to see his family, but he knows that in the future it "will not be possible".
Speaking after today's judgments, the Scottish prosecutor, David Harvey, said: "The international drug trade has no frontier, and we, whose task is to destroy it, are working increasingly closely together to achieve that we are one step forward.
"Scotian progress in the prosecution of criminals is indeed global, and in this case we have made significant economic losses to organised crime representatives."
Narcotics were collected in all the blasts on the ship, including under the floor.
The inspectors of this smuggling package found a hidden vessel in the ship’s vessel’s deck.
Mr. Harvija added: "Hamal" was identified by the French authorities for information on the investigation, and by the rapid cooperation with Tanzania, where the ship was registered, a general prosecutor who also allowed to board the ship.
"Our investigation then came from Guyana, which provided access to essential data on shipments, to Spain, which gave us very valuable information about the ship's detentions in the Canary Islands.
We also cooperated with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to combine specific evidence elements.
Despite the basic investigation that Hamal is being treated with a large amount of drugs, representatives of British authorities in international waters on board it could not dig without the permission of the Tanzanian government - something like what they had never given before.
Sju Peitena, Head of International Justice and Organised Crime Control of the Office of the Kingdom of Criminal Affairs (CPS) said: "By acting quickly and accurately, the CPS Criminal Law Counsel was able to obtain permission from the Tanzanian authorities to board within 24 hours of receiving information.
Under international maritime law, officials of the United Kingdom are not entitled to board international waters on board a vessel under the flag of another country unless that State grants a special legal permit to do so.
Without the quick action of our criminal counsel, there would be a great risk that the ship could escape and that we could never call these people to responsibility.
Photographer Brians Romeidgens lives on the busy "East Express" train
Photographer Brians Romeidgens from Rotterdam has taken pictures of this abandoned train in Belgium
In images, the inside of the rolling train, the exposed seats, the dust-covered windows and the narrow machine cabin
It has already been referred to as an Eastern express wagon, but it belonged to the Belgian National Railway Company
The city investigator has taken these important photographs, which have apparently been the result of the passenger train waste that has once been one of the best types of movement.
Its flowering times have long gone by, and the train wagon and locomotive have been left to feel the train depot in Belgium, where they have become the object of a popular photography and adventure search.
Photographer Brians Romeidgens, 40, has taken these terrible photographs, showing the rolling inside of the train, carved seats, dust-covered windows and a compressed driver's cab
The train wagon and locomotive are left to feel the train depot in Belgium, where they have become the object of a popular photography and adventure search.
These trains were a symbol of danger when working with a legendary name from 1883 to 2009.
The Belgian National Railway Company was used by locomotives about 50 years ago.
After 126 years on track, the last train operating with the name of the Eastern Express went from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, concluding the famous history phase.
Eastern expression was famous on the Paris - Istanbul route.
When it was launched in 1883 (operator - La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits) it was known as "Express d'Orient" in French.
It became the Eastern expression in 1891, and by 1930 it had already been regularly routed throughout Europe.
This should not be mixed with the private "Venice Simplon-Orient-Express".
He left a very small "Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits" luxury car.
In this photograph, measuring instruments and open guides are still installed in the narrow cabin of the machinery in which the equipment is in the frame.
Romans said that the machine cabin is "in its own way claustrophobic, and the locomotive noise must have been insurmountable."
The abandoned locomotive and wagon have become the object of a popular photography and adventure search.
After a forgotten train visit to Belgium, the Romanian MailOnlineTravel said, "I could really feel how it was used in its flowering times."
Women are accompanied by beautiful garments by good - looking men on high heels.
Grima artist Ketrina Gelovey's overtop series "Arrested Development" in Battery in Blut
Thanks to her impressive gripping skills, reviews and revalues, Texasette and YouTube censorship Ketlina Gelovje has joined the fan army.
However, her last conversions to Buster Blut from "Arrested Development" are totally unbelievable by any standards.
In three minutes' time, the video clip uploaded to her Kiki G YouTube channel, Gelloveja slowly and constantly turns itself into a failed image with a hook in place of the hand.
Even at the end of the clip, she uses an audio recording from this dangerous but at the same time in a great performance.
A talented silver artist begins his video in his, blonde woman's image.
Then, using slow photos, she slowly turns into a brilliant "memorial", which is already disposing of her hair, and which is Tony Heila Busters Bluts.
Gelovey does this with colored contact lenses, shadowing and pulling contours around the nose and eyes, as well as drawing Baster's face on his head.
Smart methods: Using slow photos, she slowly turns to Tony Heila Buster Blutt.
During her video she also takes over the cult TV image personality and manners, as well as tow.
The clip that has been placed on YouTube has been viewed more than 45,000 times, and all of a sudden there were famous comments by the artist's skills:
"You're extremely talented," a person recorded under the video posted by Gelova.
During her video she also takes over the cult TV image personality and manners
"I like how you do it all in the picture," someone added.
Videoblogger Ketlin Gelovey had already successfully converted to the "Parks and Recreation" image of Ron Svenson.
She told her YouTube followers that in the future, she was looking forward to creating gray conversions every week.

The Lancashire father is expelled from the school for wearing T-shirts with bad names
The father of two children was expelled from the children's school for coming to their sports day in the T-cricket with an offensive inscription.
Craigs Makbets (36) from Children's City in Lankashira says that he "suddenly"has drawn a crack with the inscription "Laijam and Dr.!"
However, despite the fact that when he noticed his miscarriage and pulled back the T-shirt, on the next day he found that he was forbidden to enter the school territory.
The only father who worked for four years as the principal of the Park School in Cologne, Children, was unable to come behind children because of the ban, and the staff even called social services and police.
Craig Makbets (36) from the Child says that he was not admitted to school after the child’s sports day had arrived in the intrusive T-shirt.
Mr. Childrenlija accuses the school director of Saru Midjulia of overreacting tears.
He says that he is unjustly punished for having attracted the T-shirt to the mistake of looking at his two children's competitions.
Father, who no longer works as a school manager, said, "It was a mistake and ignorance on my part."
I don't think about the sports day and I'll hurry up when I pull it off.
Near the end of the event, we had father's competition, and the director noticed my T-shirt and thanked me that it was not appropriate.
I apologized and cut it off on the other side, and that also ended the case.
However, a 36-year-old man said that he had received a letter from the president of the schools yesterday, which he was invited to meet with the director the next day, but he did not see the need to do so because he had already apologized.
"The school director then called me and said that I was forbidden to enter the school territory," said Mr. Bernley.
I learned that after the sports day some parents on Facebook had been upset about it and that many people were interested in it.
Anyone who is reliant would say that it's overdue.
Mr. Macbeta, who is the editor of the online Love Mini magazine, said that he felt he could not even come back to the children on the last semester because of the ban.
However, this was a reason for calling from school and social services.
On the T-Crek, Craig Charlza's image was Lister from the BBC cult show "The Red Rook" with one of his iconic slogans "Laiž and Dr.."
He said, "I told them I wasn't there because I'm forbidden to go to school.
Then he called me from the social services and asked why I wasn't behind the girl.
The school also called the police because I didn't come after the girl for 40 minutes."
Mr Makbeta claims that he was told that he could no longer enter school and that the ban would be in force until further notices.
He also mentioned that he had been warned that he could apply 500 pounds of fines if he was affected by the violation of this rule.
Sarah Midjly, Director of the Park Primary School, said that the case is now over.
Sarah Midjly, Director of the Park Primary School, said: "I can confirm that Mr. Makbeta has withdrawn from office and is no longer the head of our school."
This case is now over, and I hope to return to my school life in September."
Children’s city counselor Joe Küney said that the school has clear policies and guidelines.
"We all need to keep in mind that when we take on the role of a counselor or manager, you are subject to higher standards, and unfortunately this time he did not respond," he said.
Counsellor Jonathan Nixon added that he did not think that the school needed to apply the ban and that the bull had been torn from the fly.
Mr. Nixon added, "The wearing of such a T-shirt was stupid, and he apologized for it."
The Lancashire police confirmed that they had been called from school, but they did not.
In recent times, the VEF premises of the former factory, located on the streets of Freedom, have been renovated - there are several IT companies, the sector has already started to call this area a local Silicia valley.
The rest of the VEF area, including Bérzaunes, is also being developed.
The development and construction of the project of the 2nd class in TornjaKal, the LU Academic Centre, will pay EUR 21 million.
After the completion of the purchase announced by the University of Latvia on the design, construction and authorship of the second-class technical project of the Academy Centre in Tornjakal, Riga, a communication is shown on the Procurement Monitoring Office website.
The procurement is organised in the form of a negotiated procedure without prior publication of the contract notice.
The contract will be concluded with the public of the LNK Industry Group, which has committed to carrying out these works at EUR 21 186,560.
As explained by LU, the university, starting with the planning and implementation of the project planning period of the European Union Fund for 2014-2021, continues to develop the next series of academic complex - the building of the Science Centre - the design, copyright and construction, in line with the Skik project and the specified construction year.
The building of the Science Centre shall be of the same type as the building of the Science Centre, which is designed and constructed in the first place and which is similar to the most important technical and technological parameters, as well as the number of scientific and academic staff and students present in the building.
The competition rule was accompanied by the SIA Sixth style sketch project, which provided all possible suppliers with information on the development vision of the University Academy Centre in Torņkal, including a listing of the planned objects of the University Academy Centre, which contains the name of each particular object, the expected area of the object, the planned object transfer in operation of the year and other information.
At the end of 2015, the 6th style of the building complex met adjustments to the area of the building complex of the University of Latvia in TorņaKal, which have been specified as a result of the location and interconnection of the building of the academic centre, as well as the transport organisation in and around the meta area.
Announces a tender for the injection of a medicinal product into the road section.
The carrier of VAS Latvijas highways has announced the purchase of a mechanised medicine for the assembly of the road compartments in the regions of Latvia and Pirīga, informs the LAU.
The purchase item is divided into 9 lots: Aluksnes, Daugavpils, Jēkabpils, Jelgavas, Rēzeknes, Valmieras, Talsus and Riga for the purposes of the road areas.
Applicants may submit a tender for one or more lots.
Pulsing the product in the road section bars is necessary to improve the transparency of the roads and the adjacent areas, to promote water flow from the road, as well as to limit the seat of the product and the formation of the ball.
The most valuable drug-supply works for farmers in the Tals road area totaling 28 motorways in 637 kilometres, in the Valmiera road area on 20 kilometres in 432 kilometres, and in Aluksne on 17 kilometres in 384 kilometres.
It has already been announced that in June, the company completed the phasing out of the product on the national main and most important regional asphalt roads, but on the smaller regional roads and on the local roads, the holder of the VAS Latvian highways planned to entrust the phasing out work to farmers.
"We have the opportunity to make more efficient use of the funding allocated to road maintenance works, while giving farmers the opportunity to make a full contribution to the technique and to earn," stressed the President of the Management Board of VAS, Vladimir Kononov.
The time limit for submission of tenders shall be 22 August.
Legal guardian: Demagogy on the mandatory health insurance model with an additional financial burden on citizens is not subject to any criticism.
Any demagogy on compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and substantial burden on the population, is not subject to any criticism, is considered by law enforcement officer Juris Janson.
Janson met with Health Ministers Ando Chaks today to discuss the situation in the health sector.
After the meeting, the journalists said that the model of the health sector funding offered by the Minister of Health is a sustainable and developed health care system that would make it more accessible to patients.
He noted, however, that additional funding for health care is needed in this case, as it is not sufficient at the moment.
Janson also stressed that any demagogy on compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and substantial burden on the population, is not subject to any criticism, especially when the Dutch model is called.
Janson said that the Netherlands allocates 11% of the total domestic product to health while Latvia is only 3%.
Therefore, the government and Parliament must be sufficiently responsible to understand that from this point of view, the measure must be raised, the legal guardian said, and added that the model offered by the Ministry of Health (VM) would otherwise not work.
Chaksa thanked the lawyer for his support and pointed out that the main concerns are that the patient should be approached by a doctor, which means that the health care system needs additional funding.
The Minister pointed out, however, that the planned additional EUR 35 million would be possible next year only for the most acute cases in relation to oncology patients and maternity specialists.
As a result, VM has developed a plan and has submitted a request for an additional €41 million for health care in order to reduce the numbers of specialists and investigations.
"The question of priorities is whether or not funds will be available," Chakša said.
This amount does not include an increase in the remuneration of doctors.
Commenting on the fact that doctors are not excited about the fact that all three options of the health care funding model for the treatment of VM are being moved to the government, including those that provide for additional payments to patients, Chakša said that the government is given the opportunity to choose from all three models.
Janson also added that, by moving all three models, it is possible to make it clear that Latvia is not prepared to impose an additional burden on the population.
It has already been reported that the VM will defend the variant of the health funding model that does not provide for an increase in the overall tax burden, but requires part of the social tax to be sent to health, says the summary of the conceptual report on the change in the financing model of the Latvian health care system.
At the same time, the Ministry has indicated that the best option for the health funding model will be chosen as a result of discussions by the end of September.
Local orbs are ready.
Arbūsi has given up this year, the owner of Arūs Rolands Dambis, in the town of Medzes.
Orbs are already purchased on the Liepaja market.
By producing several early varieties, but later bubbles have been well abandoned, the regional newspaper Course Time.
"This year the work is growing better than last year," says the great river grower in the village of Rucavas, Artis CUUSIS.
In time, too, it was much more favorable summer than it was in the past when it was cold and windy.
The opening of Liepaja Theatre in Riga.
On August 12 and 13, the Dailes Theatre in Riga will host Liepaja Theatre, offering viewers both the performances nominated for the "Game Night" award and the brilliant intrigue - the solo performance of the director of Liepaja Theatre Herbert Laukstein, the portal "Delfi" informs the theatre representatives.
On the evening of 12 August, viewers will be presented with the human drama "Silion Man", invented by director Laura Groza-Kiber.
It is a story of a real historical person - John Mariku - who lived in the Victorian era in London and his body, because of the deformed body of the inherited disease, was summoned as a Cylon Man.
In the study, the title was created by Egon Dombrovskis, who received the title of the title "The Night of the Games" for the role of the Americas.
As critic Norman Akts described his performance, Meriks is "through the heart" a role in which the birth is not repeatable".
On 13 August, the presentation "Portraits" will be offered to viewers.
The exhibition received six "Game Night" nominations, including "The Big Year Exhibition".
The director has created the impression as a self-made portrait gallery, while giving each play a big role, each of them has both a center and a background.
The display consists of it as one of several mini displays that closes in the single health.
It is a observation of the nature of a person, where the main conflict is between real emotions and a cold calculation, by discovering how man changes in different situations - each of the heroes is sometimes a wolf who, for the sake of his wealth and benefit, scatters the surrounding, sometimes the sheep which has been scattered by another.
On the other hand, the two dates will be played in the Small Hall by the director of Liepaja Theatre Herbert Laukstein "People who are more of the lift" in the Polish style.
It is not a sad story, but a full story of how a person’s only friend becomes an elevator.
Despite the stylisticness of the caps, which dominates the visual image, the dominant intonation of the impression is still bright and even optimistic.
"The person who is most of the elevator" is not about the determination of loneliness and age, but about the fact that life is worth loving.
Also, if it turns out that there is nothing," critic Liga Ulbert wrote about the performance.
Tickets for all polls can be bought in the "Bills Paradise" box and online.
Detective Olga: My work is not a serial, but a real life.
I already have a half-way waiting for Olga Zeļika, the owner and investigator of the Riga Detective Agency.
She smiles loudly and leaves a very positive impression on the person.
Dressed in white shirts and white jackets - a very elegant woman who embraces all my ideas about what a woman-detector should have.
She's waiting for me with a champagne that I'm gonna say good-bye.
I'm just saying that I spoke to him because I thought it was interesting that a woman was working on such an unusual thing.
It's always the work of men.
Olga has higher legal education - master's degree.
He's been working with the criminal police in his own time.
You realized that he wanted something of his own and founded his company.
You've got to know.
"I really didn't want to go back to the police," Olga says.
It's routine.
There, in the criminal police, we were investigating cases, collecting information.
We work with suspects.
"This year we celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the Riga Detective Agency."
She calls for the anniversary celebrations: "There will be no drinking."
They're all solid people.
As far as her business is concerned, Olga says, "Business is very specific."
For the first five years, I had a team.
Then I realized that sometimes working on a team is dangerous.
It's a business when, if someone does not work professionally, they can get into a very bad situation.
If journalists are fifth, then we're the second.
Spherical, of course, is not simple.
Many try to buy us because we are involved in cheating on our marriage mate.
That's what people think!
Many come and ask if you can put on hearing aids, attract dogs.
Many have seen films.
Detective business is serious.
"It's information collection," says Olga.
If there is a crime under the law, I have to warn.
We call green tea and laugh - to be at least a breast with which to hold and negotiate.
I've had a client whose husband is constantly sitting.
She was looking for protection, of course.
We also have protection.
Her husband was a maniac.
At first, everything is always beautiful and good, but then it starts.
"It's the most dangerous thing," says Olga.
Psyche is broken, and it happens that you can be treated like a wolf.
It could end badly.
God don't give it to me.
It's very dangerous.
People become victims at some point.
"Many women try to leave their families and then return," she says.
I refuse the last order.
"It happened the first time in my life," Olga says.
There was such a strange situation.
The woman was married, she had a son.
"His husband beat his son and made him disabled," Olga recalls.
I believe that a woman has a mother’s instinct, and first of all, she needs to protect her children.
When all this came to pass, she came to me with a request to be released from her husband.
There are people who are obsessed with activism.
The most dangerous thing is that the mother noticed it.
I can't understand that.
Her child is now disabled.
We couldn't find a body once, and the dog was very helpful.
The drug department can't go anywhere without dogs.
"I understand that there are adequate people and there are those who don't have a whole psyche," she says.
Of course, the facts of fraud are up to date.
Is there a divorce in the family, and information needs to be collected.
It's clear which side is the fault.
The last thing I had to do was think about the way others thought about it.
That's interesting, because sometimes men smack, now women.
Even the best friends are fighting!
Women's "lost" threats of 100 and more thousands of euros.
Women need to be careful when traveling abroad because they can be sold in slavery.
"Latvian women are intelligent and of great trust," Olga says.
There have been cases when couples go abroad to get married a second time.
It's not legal.
Olga relates that she had a husband who was like Jesus Christ.
Long growth, long hair.
When I was 22, there was a tragedy.
He had a serious head injury.
He returned as a completely different person.
"I've drawn them," Olga remembers.
It could be compared to hell, it was terrible.
The question is, what's the most unusual thing you've ever met, Olga says, "They're all special, but it's the most spectacular thing where trust is used."
When friends "get" friends.
Picks up and doesn't give up the money.
If you have a lawyer's education and experience in the police, you can work as a detective.
"One thing is to feel like a detective, another - to be there," says Olga.
The situations in which we deal with the issues of infidelity are extremely worrisome, as women are often not prepared to solve the situation.
They are not ready to accept the result.
This is an unexpected situation because a person is not ready to lose his family.
Not every woman was prepared to accept reality.
Often young girls who feel money taste use rich married men.
One man who pursued his wife said that she could not be loved because all the women had deceived him.
"He had been married three times," Olga recalls.
At the same time, it is a man’s problem if all the women are cheating on him.
Olga tells of a case when a woman with all the children left her husband and asked him if he had ever raised his hand against her.
Above all, I constantly sat him down, he answered.
In such cases, I will refuse to work.
I think it's interesting how things are handled - whether photographs are taken and shown to a living partner if there's evidence of fraud.
How's it going?
"There is a protection of the data of natural persons for the role of a paralytic detective," Olga says.
That is a challenging question.
One law allows everything to be done, the other does not allow anything.
We can take such photographs and videos for personal interest, but not for public viewing.
If a case is brought before a court that does not comply with the law, there may be serious problems.
To become a detective, education and experience must also be mentally healthy and meet the criteria.
We don't take fingerprints, it's handled by the police.
I tell my clients - get out of the serials, here is real life!
In fact, when I worked in the (police) system, dogs had to be used, they helped a lot.
"The drug department can't happen without dogs at all," says Olga.
Some customers are looking at me in connection with the murder investigation, but I don't like to do such things.
These are very serious things.
Now there are more and more clients than men, because women tend to compete for men.
It used to be different.
Now women are having fun, but men are sitting at home with children.
"Of course, you suffer most well-being," is Olga.
I like Deil's Carnegie.
He says - stop acting and start living real.
We all know that if you sit on one face, you have to turn the other, but you can't!
You have to say that you're uncomfortable.
It must not be done.
You must not be afraid to lose what is in your life!
You must not become a minor, and we also have what we are allowed to do with ourselves.
Yes, my first case was directly related to a man’s infidelity when the woman was not ready to accept the fact that the man was cheating on him.
She called all the time and asked what she was doing.
"I now ask all clients whether they are willing to accept the situation when they know that a man is really cheating on them," Olga says.
It's not fun, it's life.
If you're a detective, you have to take responsibility.
It's not a theater, it's a show, it's a real life.
I'm also an expert.
It is a heart thing and is related to Japanese medicine - hand-treated.
It's a very interesting thing.
Why did I start working on it?
This is associated with a large amount of adrenaline, and you need to calm down.
Not only is it necessary to calm down, but it restores energy, light.
"People get out of my office positively and satisfied," Olga says.
She has the necessary signs at the wall office, and Olga tells us that they are written, not by a bear, but by fingers.
I didn't just go there, the book is literally in my hands.
I'd feel it as a sign.
However, it is very personal.
You need to know more about it here.
Olga's singing too.
It's her pleasure.
We're all in trouble.
I've been playing guitar for 11 years.
I've recorded songs and clips.
I'm positive and smiling, but I have to rest to get back.
Others save alcohol, I need it.
Alcohol in the bush.
The police use it a lot because the job is full of stress.
"It causes aggression, and the movements can be unpredictable," she says.
I'm interested in sports and needs.
I worked with tennis for 15 years.
I still needed horses.
I would like to write a book in nature, articles.
The detective's work has a narrow limit when it comes to your life.
"It is a work that should not be allowed to live," she says.
The question of how to combine work with private life is, Olga says, "My beloved person is in Italy."
We have very strong feelings.
At that time, I have the most true love in my life.
I think enough about him, and I feel better already.
Detectives don't usually believe in it, but he's taken my job.
Actually, I'm separating work from private life.
I'm not the same in this business.
I've got to go.
Already when I was a child, I saw more than others.
Thanks to the need, the intuition is open.
There's a lot of detectives, but they're really working - little.
In any case, it is work with the brain, and it is difficult to turn off.
You also need rest.
"Wherever you can't come back," Olga admits.
The hardest case I've ever worked with is the Constance story.
I've been working on it for a year.
The man was literally joking about their woman.
I did so, however, that the child and his mother went to England - far from danger.
There was no other option.
We must not love ourselves.
We're looking for compassion.
You can't do that.
We have to rejoice in every day that we have.
Thank God.
Every day, three good things must be told to each other.
A good deed must be done or a day must be brought to itself.
We can't do that with men.
That's a big mistake.
We need to understand that we have a man, not a child, and we need him to take care of us.
If it's not good, you have to go back and get away.
You can go to church, it's been a great help.
You don't have to be a fan, but you do what you like and help.
Nothing will change if you don't change, you have to go away and change your life.
You must never put yourself and your children at risk.
You don't have to sit down and wait for something.
Humans are created to do good and to support one another.
If God created us, we are already in need and are not dedicated to this world.
You must never sit on the ground!
How better to prepare for the family photo session.
The summer is still in full swing, as is the immediate present of the regular year of education that families tend to live in photos.
To illustrate how all will look happy and beautiful, it is worth considering how to prepare for the photo session in advance.
Ihappymama advises a multi-child mother, Aleksandra Nesterenko, and a professional photographer, Marina Levickaja.
It must be photographed in nature, because it is much more natural and more harmonious.
In the study, children find it much harder to get in touch and relax.
It is recommended to choose a uniform style for the entire family, preferably in one color range.
For example, Alexandra tells us that she chooses clothing for all six family members so that the clothes are not more than three color tons and as little as possible on the clothes.
Don't forget about a good mood.
Listen, joke, play, but in no case prevent and avoid psycho, if children are not as obedient immediately as they would like.
And, here's the next tips already tasted from the professional photographer's pure load!
You have to understand exactly what you want to experience during the photo session and talk about their photograph.
Some of them will be beautiful, neat children and ideally designed family image, others - "life is what it is," i.e., in the images of the will to see real, true emotions, or how to love to say the photograph itself, - "escaped back", "open eyes", "sprayed deggingal".
Of course, there's a chance someone wants "two in one", but it happens rarely.
In any case, when you go to the photo session, you have to understand that they're only a few hours from your life, and you'll be less excited, better.
You are yourself - not a hard mom who works, prepares to eat, grows up and continues to eat, and not a busy dad who talks on the phone forever.
Nor is he that dwelleth in thee, who by no means knoweth not the Son of man.
Be a family, remember how wonderful it is to see each other, to smile at each other, and to laugh at each other.
And then the task of a photographer will only be to capture the real moments of emotions that exist between you.
If you have chosen a photograph, trust him.
Stop 250 times asking to show what's happened, listen to his advice in choosing clothing, instead of better frames.
Put all necessary clothes on and off before the photo session day should no longer be handled.
Plan the route and think about how much time you will need to get to the photo-session site (especially when photography takes place in the study and time is limited).
If you have young children, choose a photo session time that corresponds to the day-to-day withdrawal regime, so that it does not happen at a time when the baby usually sleeps diendus.
And, of course, never forget to take food, vegetables, water and favorite toys with children (to use almonds and sweets only in extreme situations).
Dad prepared that he might have to pull the bags, but he doesn't usually write them in the following tips, and only the photographers know what the problem is, he recognizes Marina.
Don't drink much water before the photo session and get well before that.
And it would still be advisable after the photo session to organize a fun together.
Go to the attraction park, eat some ice cream, go to the ski slopes - which the family likes more.
At the same time, you will have received wonderful pictures and pleasant memories of the day shared together.
Krasnopjorovs and Fadejeva: Minimum wage - wonder or brake for the economy?
The issue of minimum wages in public discussions is almost or the status of the holy cow: either it is necessary to support the increase, or it is necessary to mention any unspoken, general phrases.
In view of the significant increase in the risk of economic stagnation (we have barely avoided technical recession), it is important to stress that minimum wage raising is not a miracle that reduces income inequality with one household, closes to the level of Latvia's salary in Western Europe and fills the national budget.
On the contrary, if the minimum wage goes too far, it is more harmful than beneficial because it reduces the competitiveness and employment of businesses, in particular in sectors and regions with low income.
In the first moment, despite a number of increases in the minimum wage during the post-crisis period, the minimum wage in Latvia does not seem to be so high as to significantly weaken the competitiveness of businesses for the first few decades of the year - only EUR 370, while in some European Union (EU) countries the minimum wage is about half a thousand.
However, a different approach is open when compared to the average wage country (%) - the minimum wage in Latvia (44%) exceeds the EU average.
Since the share of the minimum wage recipients in Latvia is significantly higher than in neighbouring countries (Latvia - 17%, Lithuania - 11%, Estonia - 6%[1]), a similar minimum wage increase is due to the majority of companies.
According to the results of the Latvian Bank’s survey, each fifth Latvian company replied that increasing the minimum wage at the beginning of 2014 was important or very important to increase the prices of the products.
This means that, firstly, the minimum wage growth was partly financed by consumers (i.e. Latvians); secondly, price increases for several companies meant loss of competitiveness on both the domestic market and abroad (i.e. increased imports and limited exports).
The lack of competitiveness and the production of smoke almost every fifteen-year-old Latvian company was important for the release of workers (i.e. higher unemployment and emigration).
In addition, almost every eleven companies replied that it was important for them to limit the employment of new workers.
It is worth remembering that the minimum wage in Latvia remained unchanged in 2011-2013.
Therefore, even if each 5th company considered improving productivity as an important factor in the assessment of the minimum wage for 2014, this does not yet mean that similar results could be expected in 2017 (the fourth minimum wage increase could in turn result in productivity opportunities).
Another important result is - due to the increase in the minimum wage, it was also important for several companies to increase the remuneration of employees who deserve more than the minimum wage.
Thus, the impact of the minimum wage was significant even for those companies where none of the employees received the minimum wage.
In recent years, the increase in minimum wages in all three Baltic countries exceeded the increase in nominal labour productivity (real labour productivity + inflation).
Consequently, the further increase in the wage gap (even though the overall low level in the euro is relatively low) will have a negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of businesses.
When assessing the validity of the minimum wage requirement, it is not sufficient to analyse the average economic performance.
It is also necessary to assess whether the minimum wage is being raised in the "panesome" sectors and regions where the minimum wage is most frequently used.
The results of the Latvian Bank's surveys show that employees with minimum wages are the largest concentration in small enterprises (the number of employees is between 10 and 19 employees; 25%).
At the end of 2013, the share of employees with minimum wages was higher (16% and 19% respectively) than trade (15%), construction (11%) and financial and insurance sectors (2%).
On the other hand, Latgali, where the minimum wage is 64% of the average wage (and more than two thirds of the average wage in the private sector), its further increase can be more damaging by reducing labour demand (i.e., maintaining it already high unemployment) and contributing to the stability of the shadow economy.
Some signs indicate that the minimum wage increases implemented in 2014-2015 (a total of 27%) have slowed the development of Latgale.
For example, Latgale is the only region in Latvia where unemployment was higher in 2015 than in 2013.
It should be noted that there is no region in Estonia and Lithuania that would leave so much of the average salary from the rest of the country.
For example, in all regions of Estonia, the average wage is at least twice the minimum wage fixed by the country.
Lithuania's lowest salary is in the Taurage region, but also the minimum wage in 2015 was 54% of the average salary (after two rapid minimum wage increases in 2016 this figure could reach 58%).
In the public debate, the time-consuming call for a minimum wage of up to 68% of the average wage in the country (e.g. here) lacks an economic basis and is not implemented either in the short term or in the long term.
Firstly, such a high figure of average wages or even so close is not in any EU country.
Secondly, this would mean raising the minimum wage above average wages in several economic sectors (which would mean the bankruptcy and mass redundancy of these industries), such as clothing, leather products, fish processing, food services and veterinary services; it is also more than the current average wage in the private sector of Latgale.
The minimum wage rise from January to January 2017 to EUR 400-410 per month, as currently offered by the Ministry of Welfare, would make the minimum wage in Latvia (% of average salary) one of the highest in the EU.
If nominal productivity increases by 4% but the minimum wage is at least twice as fast, it has a clearly negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of companies.
Such negative effects will be most widespread in sectors and regions where the current minimum wage is already often used, for example in Latvia.
The fact that we cannot now allow a significant increase in minimum wages means that other mechanisms must be used to support low-wage beneficiaries.
The immediate effect can be achieved by means of an irrevocable minimum of income tax (within the budgetary limits).
Insufficient levels of education, inadequate education and poor quality of education, as well as unsatisfactory health status (which often occurs in the absence of medical care due to greed and long-term lines) are mentioned among the real causes of income inequality.
During the survey, 521 responses were received from the Latvian company for a response to the minimum wage increase in January 2014.
The survey took place within the framework of the project for the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN) of the European System of Central Banks.
These figures represent enterprises with a minimum of 10 employees.
It also explains the proportion of low employees with minimum wages in construction.

The legendary editor Hafington leaves "The Huffington Post".
Arianna Hafington, an influential U.S. media holder "The Huffington Post" and editor-in-chief, announced the departure of the company after 11 years of work.
The Huffington Post, created in 2005 and awarded the Pulicera Prize, which offers every day both serious policy and economic journalism, and ensures that Internet sensations are reflected in entertainment, is seen as a source of media development at the time of rapid development of digital technology solutions.
The media, starting in 2005, offered innovative and interactive content solutions for its time when there was no Twitter yet, but Feisbuk only gained popularity among students in national colleges.
Shortly after the re-election of the representative of the Republican Party, George Bush, President of the United States, Hafington did not hide that the media journalists represented liberal values, and with such a view of the world, the materials of ready news.
Now Hafington's tweet revealed that after leaving he is about to start a new business - he plans to create a "Trive Global" launch that would address the health and overload of workers.
In the meantime, it is not known what could be in her place under the leadership of The Huffington Post.

During the last 24 hours, nine explosions have occurred in the southern provinces of Huahin and southern Thailand, killing at least four people and several dozens of others, the authorities announced on Friday.
Two explosions occurred in southern Thailand on Friday at eight o'clock after the local time.
One explosion exploded in the pool in front of the sea police building, killing the municipal staff and hurting a man, the governor of the province of Vongsiri Promčana announced in Surathan.
"I think it's related to the explosions in Huahin," said the governor.
The second explosion took place in front of the province police station.
On Friday morning in southern Thailand, two explosions took place on Phukete Island.
On Friday morning, two blasts exploded at Huahin at the bell tower, killing one and hurting three people.
It has already been reported that two explosions have occurred in Huahin, a town in the middle of a quarter of the night, killing one woman and hurting another 19 people, including foreigners.
The woman who was killed in Huahin on Thursday was a Timekeeper.
Of the 19 injured, three were in a serious situation, and seven were foreigners — four women and three men.

Police rescue babies from a car overcrowding; parents are in danger of a flashing glass of justice.
In Riga yesterday, municipal policemen rescued infants from a trafficked car, while the child’s parents threatened the police with judicial work on the display of the car glass, the agency LETA informed the Riga City Police (RPP).
Yesterday, at the patrol, a man who told me that a car in Spice’s parking lot had been parked with a baby for half an hour without an adult presence.
On arrival at the place of the event, a car designated by the battery was parked in the sun.
The first passenger seat was the baby seat where the baby was present.
The sun was shining directly on the child.
The baby was loud, breathing intensely, and her face was reddish and swollen.
In view of the fact that the owner of the vehicle has not been found on the spot, the immediate decision is to release the rear-view glass of the vehicle in order not to endanger the health and life of the baby.
The child with all the seats removed from the contact vehicle, and the doctors summoned.
The child was breathing a stroke, the skin was reddish and hot, so before the doctors arrived, the guards on the counter imposed cold compressions.
At the site, almost simultaneously the doctors and the parents of the child arrived.
The father of the baby, holding the exposed window to his vehicle, remained aggressive and the doctors did not let the child in.
Talks have been conducted with parents and it is explained that children under the age of seven are prohibited from leaving one without supervision.
In addition, the child was left for health and life under dangerous circumstances.
After a discussion, the doctor examined the patients and found that hospitalization was not necessary.
On the other hand, the children’s parents categorically refused to provide any explanation about the incident and threatened with judicial action on the glass of the car.
During the discussion with the parents, there was no indication that they were alcohol - related or otherwise harmful to the child, so the infant was taken into both care for for less than four months.
The material of the case has been sent to the Department for the Prevention of Children's Violations, whose staff will assess the responsibilities of the parents.
The RPP recalls that even if the outside is not very hot, the car left in the sun will burn very fast.
If a child or a pet is left in such a car, it may endanger their lives.
The LPF members could request the resignation of Poni.
The members of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) could soon ask the Federation's president to cancel its current leader Kaspar Poni, the agency LETA told the Federation's former vice president, Janis Dhenis.
Jeanis said that in view of the criticism of Poni and his activities in the federation of the last days, several LPF members have signed a letter asking to convene a general meeting of the LPF, which is the highest federal institution, and it is right to decide on any issue raised by the LPF general meeting.
The members of the Federation are not satisfied with the style of Pones management, as well as his approach to the Olympic Games in Riodezaneiro, which, in turn, were unable to go to the Latvian record of the Olympic swimming coach Alonas Ribakovas, German Jakubovski, was regarded as an unethical and undeservable act of the president.
Jeanis pointed out that members of the LPF, as well as the Secretary General of the Federation Aivars Platonovs, have done great work for the development of the federation and the sport type, but the contribution of the Parliament to the Federation is not very welcome.
Jean, who worked in the federation for a long time, explained that the federation was an attempt to concentrate power on one person’s hands.
Consequently, the members of the Federation could also request the amendment of the statutes governing the operation of the LPF, which would exclude such a possibility in the future.
Janis explained that the dissatisfaction with the work of the Pones in the Federation has been a long time, but the events of the last days have served as members of the "last pillar" of the federation to decide that action should be taken.
The former Federation Vice-President said that during the work of the Pones, the work of the trainers and judges councils was very limited.
Jeanis explained that, in order to ensure faster process and decision-making in the federation, the LPF members at a general meeting had decided to run the federation for the authorisation of the board of directors of Pone and two vice-presidents.
However, as Janis acknowledged, he joined the federation.
The members of the federation trusted Ponm, thinking that this would make decisions in the federation more quickly.
"He betrayed the trust of his brothers because he practically took power in his hands by taking non-ethical steps," Janis said.
"This attitude cannot be one of those who should serve as an example to other sports representatives," Jeanis acknowledged.
In Jean's view, Mr Pone has tried to satisfy his ambitions, which, in turn, does not honor him as President of the LPF.
LETA, Secretary-General of LPF, told the Agency that the letter could be submitted to the Federation next week and that the general meeting of LPF should reach within a month.
In his view, the general meeting has "all the troubled issues" and must decide on the action to be taken.
Mr. Friday had not yet been informed that the LPF members were planning to convene a general meeting which could decide on his resignation from office.
In the meantime, I don’t know anything about such a meeting, so I don’t have a comment.
As for the fact that the members are not satisfied with my work, so far there has been only one case, with the former coach Jakubovski when some dissatisfaction has been expressed.
Before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any athletes.
"After this case, Jakubovskis lost his senior coach's job, because his action was not in the interest of the LPF," said Mr.
He also pointed out that there had not yet been setbacks in the general meetings of the LPF members, which reported on their achievements.
"On the contrary, we have received recognition that the quality of the Federation's work has improved," said the President of the LPF.
He also explained that the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro did not have to play but rather work.
For most people in Latvia, it is not clear and they do not understand what the functions of the federation presidents are.
People do not understand that we are volunteers in these positions, and, for example, unlike the leaders of the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK), we do not receive wages.
At the same time, we need to ensure that the sport federation is adequately financed, as only 10% of the required amount is received from the national LPF.
During the Olympics, I have had formal and informal meetings with representatives of the international federation and various international programmes, including international sponsors.
"The negotiations have also been introduced and I work towards one of the stages of the World Cup in Riga in 2018," said Mr.
According to the company.lv portal data, in 2015 LPF revenue totaled EUR 249 444, which is EUR 36 000 less than in 2014.
About 40% of this amount was made up of the targeted grants received last year, which increased by around EUR 10 000 compared to 2014.
Also, in the form of membership, accession and other annual contributions, the LPF received around 43% of revenue, namely EUR 109 442.
In the form of donations and donations, the Federation received another EUR 35,532.
Previous federal expenditures compared to 2014 increased by around EUR 70,000, by totaling EUR 263 876 in 2015.
Major expenditure was not related to payments of money to persons, material expenditures, or salaries - 215 733 of the euro account is referred to as "other expenditure".
Money payments for persons are spent EUR 20 549, while wages are paid EUR 14 684.
If the 2014 Federation had concluded a positive balance sheet, the 2015 LPF had concluded a negative balance sheet.
As reported, the Ministry of Education and Science (IZM) requested an explanation to the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) of the participation of LPF President Pone in the Olympic Games of Rio de Janeiro, on which the coach of the Latvian swimmer, Ribakova, Jakubovskis, did not go.
Latvian nationals have not suffered from the attacks in Thailand, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (AM) on the social website Twitter.
The Ministry has indicated that according to the Latvian Consul of Honor, the information available in Thailand has not been affected by the public explosions of Latvia.
LETA has already reported that the AM calls on travellers to follow regularly with information on the political and security situation in the country and to make sure that the place of residence is safe, indicating that there is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
Latvia’s AM calls on people to avoid meeting places, to be particularly careful and cautious in maintaining public places, and to follow the instructions of local authorities.
Travellers who are in or are planning to move on to Thailand shall be invited by the Ministry to contact tour operators or airlines, specifying whether the journey will be carried out in accordance with the plan.
The Ministry also calls on travellers to follow regularly with information on the political and security developments in the country and to make sure that the place of residence is safe.
There is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
Given the unstable security situation in the country, AM does not recommend going to the border of Thailand and Cambodia, as well as to the provinces of the border of Thailand and Malaysia - Patany, Jala, Narathivata and Sonkhla.
In an emergency situation, the Ministry invites you to contact the Consular Department’s daily day of service on the telephone +371 26 33 77 11 or e-mail palidziba@mfa.gov.lv.
The AM also strongly recommends that anyone who travels abroad, before travelling, acquires a life and health insurance policy, which also provides for repatriation in the event of sickness or death and is registered in the consular register.
Mess, however, will not miss the Argentinian football selection.
The football superstar Lionel Mesi, however, decided to return to Argentina on Friday, the player himself announced.
In July, in the second year of Argentina's election, the success of the Copa America tournament in order to recognise Chile's victory again in the decisive match.
Immediately after the loss, Messi announced that he had finished his career in the country, but then it was reported that he could return in the election.

The Spanish Grand Barcelona runner Mesi won 55 gates in 112 in the national unity ranks, which is the best indicator of all time.
Together with the adult sample Messi had not had much success, although in 2014 Argentina became a world champion.
The month is five times called the world's best football player.
For the Chinese Jean and Dzelinas in the distance of Rio 20 km of promise.
China's dreamers Vans Jeans and Cai Dzelins fought for a double-power riodežaneiro for 20 kilometers in the Olympics.
The Olympic champion was crowned Jean, who took the distance in 19 minutes and four seconds, at the end of the 12 seconds before the sunset.
On the other hand, the Australian salesman Deins Bärds-Smits, who lost Jean for 23 seconds, was beaten with bronze.
The host's favorite Kayu Bonfims corrected Brazil's record, but he needed five seconds to climb to the honor of the pedestal.
Jean got a bronze medal in London four years ago.
He also has two gold medals in the world’s championships at this same distance.
Judo Coach Baskins: Nikiforenko is not a real weight.
Latvian Jewish coach Olīg Baskin acknowledged with honesty that Arthur Nikiforenko Rio was not able to escape the severest Azerbaijani sportsman Ushangi Kukauri in the Olympics.
Practically, it was not minimal if he could have been drawn into a way or a party.
We've already planned that it will.
He was well prepared, and he fought well, but the enemy was stronger.
The antidote was well - known, for Nikiforenko had fought him twice and both Arthur had lost.
He's tougher, though.
Arturus has been artificially transferred to the heavier category of weight to enter the Olympic team.
The weight category up to 100 kilograms had already been taken over, therefore Arthur used the European allowances in the heavy weight category.
Arthur, weighing 100 kilograms, fought a Jew with 140 kilograms and has won several major tournaments.
In the heavy weight category there is a very little random moment at all.
If the weights are light in the years, then the weight is very rare.
On the question of whether Nikiforenko would further be better to fight one degree in the lighter weight category, Baskin answered with approval.
I think it should - Arthur would be better to fight in the category up to 100 kilograms.
It's his real weight category.
He's not the real weight.
65% of Venezuelans want to leave Maduro, the question is whether they are willing to fight for it.
Two of the three Venezuelans want to represent President Nikolas Maduro, but the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
The day after the National Elections Board announced that "no time" for the withdrawal of the vote that took place this year, with which the Chavismo will be at the power plant by 2019, people in the streets of Karakas continued their days of coming, just as nothing would have happened.
"I didn't hear the news because I looked at the Olympics and how Michael Felps got two more medals," said Rafael Deian, a 36-year-old office worker who rested in Altamira's field on Wednesday.
The area of Altamira, located in the east of Karakas, was at the beginning of 2014.
However, now that the opposition has to exert greater pressure than ever before in order to achieve the referendum this year, people throughout the country no longer show such energy.
"I would like a referendum, but for security reasons I will not participate in the protests," said Deans.
Others, more informed, want to mobilize in the future, however, recognize that the Venezuelans are not so motivated.
The President of the Election Board, Tibieseis Lusena, commented that the government was delaying the process of revocation.
I will protest whenever the opposition calls for a protest, but I know that some of my friends are afraid," Roberto Reijess, (60), said Fox News Latino.
So, in addition to all the barriers the government has raised to delay the referendum, the opposition now faces a new challenge: to motivate people to go out the streets and protest.
Recently, the referendum initiative has had extensive support - in the process of collecting the signatures, people have arrived unforeseeable as a couple.
However, when it comes to protesting against government movements to block efforts, the number of residents is likely to be smaller.
"Some people are focused on the creation of food chains, while others are afraid after 2014 arrests and death cases," said Cipriano Eredia, opposition legislator.
After Lusena announced that until the next step of the referendum process - even more signatures to be collected across the country - will have to be expected by October, those who oppose the Socialist government say that President Maduro and his followers are simply trying to remove the courage of the Venezuelan people by making them believe that the vote is practically impossible this year.
According to the Constitution, if the referendum were to be held in 2017, Maduro could be removed from office, but he would be allowed to appoint the next president.
If he were to be forsaken today, he has an obligation to declare general elections.
The US Department of State addressed this issue in a statement on Thursday afternoon, calling on the Venezuelan authorities to ensure that the Venezuelan constitutional rights are respected.
"The last steps to implement the President's withdrawal referendum must be made clear, concrete and immediately, thus contributing to the rapid and effective resolution of the political, economic and social difficulties of the current country," it said.
Luis Salamanka, political analyst, who was a member of the electoral board between 2006 and 2009, that changes are not expected so soon.
"I thought that this year there would be no referendum unless the social unrest and protests would become even stronger," he said to the FNL.
He said that Lusena and the government were violating the law, but as a result, they would achieve their goal if people did not protest.
The opposition called for a wide-ranging demonstration in September. First of all, in Karakas, to ask for speeding up the process so that recall can take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to be mobilized in the capital today.
The government will feel the pressure," Eredia said.
Salamanka, on the other hand, believes that this situation cannot be waited for so long.
"They should respond to Lusena's statement faster and stronger because it practically kills the referendum," said FNL expert.
Congressman Eredia admitted that some opposition parties want to make the event happen faster, but another group wants more time to organize.
The opposition must now be cautious.
If people feel insecure in this situation, there is a risk that the second campaign for the collection of signatures will be low," Salamanka said.
The referendum process to activate it must be supported by 20 per cent of the national voters, who are almost 4 million people.
Salamanka and other analysts are convinced that even if the revocation takes place in 2017, the Chavismo will be offended.
However, some people are not so optimistic.
Our party wants political change today.
"If the government closes the way to the elections, we will have to explore other legal possibilities," Eredia said to the FNL.
The Directors of LNSC, A.Pučīti, shall be represented on a temporary basis.
At the extraordinary meeting of the council of the municipality of Grand Várdas, the majority of the members supported the resignation of the director of the municipality of Grand Várdas Sport Centre (LNSC) of Ainara Pučiša from the performance of the duties over time while the service was being checked.

In other words, during the training course, the LNSC client received a head injury during the visit.
The centre of Sport is located in the municipality of Vielvärdes.
In view of the seriousness of the situation and the possible appeal of the client to the court, the commission established by the Vice-President of the council of the municipality of Vitas Volontes was set up by the Vice-President of the municipality.
Its task is to carry out a service inspection at the Sport Centre and to deliver an opinion until 16 August of this year.

Opres senior sports are holidays.
Today, the Sports Festival of the Ogres pensioners took place at the Sports Centre Stadium in the village of Ogres.
At the Senior Stadium, the organizer of the Sports Development Centre of the town of Ogres, Sanita Taurinja, who had prepared a special programme for participants in the Sports Festival.
No individual results will be evaluated at this time, but participants in the sports holidays will be divided into four teams.
"The team's contribution will result from each participant's team," explains S.Tauriņa.
Participants will have to perform four tasks - basketball fasts, Eiffel tower building together with memory game, florbola fitness stadium, summer hideout.
In order to successfully start all four-week program disciplines, participants had to carry out the heating tasks - "Unity circle", "Rinko dance", "Implementation", and three traineeships - with horses, carry out the Frisbian and Badminton elements.
All the tasks were prepared in an attractive form, and the participants of the sports holidays performed them with joyful, smiley and fun comments, supporting each other.
A special sensation led to summer hiding, which took place in the event of the organizer’s clothes.
The competitions followed closely the volunteers of the centre of the town of Ogres Sport, who conducted the tasks, fixed the results and failed to heed the advice.
There was also the symbol of Ogrès Čikurs, who inspired participants in the sports festivals.
Ogros seniors proved that they are quite weak, attractive and are in good sport.
Green team representative Peter Zeps was placed eight times exactly in the basketball game, only one successful year left for his team member, Janis Staudžs.
In horticulture pensioners are active.
On tours, buses are always full, and there are about 300 people on the ball.
"We meet twice a week in the rooms of the Family Support Centre, where we can play new, table tennis, use coaches," says the president of the Ogres Pensioner Society, Janis Staudžs.
At the end of the sports holidays, all participants received thanks to the Sports Centre of Ogres, but the biggest benefit is fresh air, good weather and shared time.
2016/2017 Premierly scheduled No.19 West Bromwich Albion
Guardian journalists predict position 14 (Note: it's not just Alan Smith's forecast, but our journalists' advice in general)
Item 14 of the last season
The prospect of winning the league (with Oddschecker) 1000-1
Until last week, it looked after a new season, such as the old Bromwich Albion: 2016/2017 season will once again be a struggle for satisfaction or stagnation, depending on how much "empty is glass" under Tony Pulis' leadership.
However, Jeremiah Pēss sold 88% of his club shares to Guochuan Lai and Pulis, in an architecturally safe hand, which the bukmeikers immediately made to be a favorite in the unfavorable first fired manager.
The situation has inevitably changed Balack Country - and not only Hawthorns, but also some of the jealousy in the north-west Volverhampton, where the new Chinese owners, while not spending time, refused to serve Kenya Jacket.
To confirm, however, that his work is not immediately compromised, and the entrepreneur has also expressed his desire not to change the culture of the club.
"I don't want to change the faith of the club or start an unsustainable susceptibility," he said, taking over responsibilities.
I want to be a good owner and invest in this club in the long term.
First of all, our goal is to ensure that we remain in the Premierli and then to be further further, I would like to see the club strengthened at the top of the division.
I think it's the best league in the world, and I want to take this club as far as possible.
These are the achievements of Pulis, and the first aspect should not be difficult.
The next goal is to break down to the top of the table, but the new owner and the increasingly fragmented fan base will be important to look forward to a quick draw table up to find out that this is an extremely difficult task, taking into account the basic work that has recently invested in the other teams next to the table.
To be beyond the 14th place of the past season, to be on top, there will certainly be more work to be done.
Only Aston Villa, located at the bottom of the table, entered the lower gate, and it is worth recalling that on average the Christmas Albion did less than one seat by the gate in 90 minutes, almost or the worst indicator of the division.
They failed to obtain gates 13 of the 38 games, and they enter more than one gate in only nine games.
Out of their 10 wins in no game failed to get more than one gate, and seven games ended with 1-0.
As expected, a total of 34 gates were obtained from standard positions.
There is no wonder that Hawthorn's team ruled dissatisfaction, possibly most visible after the shocking 0-0 was not separated by Villa at the end of January when the guest team looked better.
On the other hand, only six of the best teams had better protection indicators - although no club has been able to include four side guards in the list.
These safeguards are often not sufficiently assessed, especially by Johnny Evans, who wants to be Arsenal, taking into account their recent crisis in the face of the guilty players.
The Northern international team experienced a great start at the European Championship, and Albion will have to spend a lot of time in order to sell.
Ben Foster's doors are reliable, and they are well integrated in the middle line.
Darens Fletchers, much like Evans, demonstrated to a large extent that he is still able to play at a high level at 32 years of age, and Claudio Jacobs is underestimated.
It is disturbing to all parties that the long and lycocaic story of the future of Saidi Berahino is still unclear.
In short, the owner's rates from Stoke and Crystal Palace were denied, but they still maintain peace and Mark Higges is ready to wait.
After the last season, being close to the liquidation, it is worth acting on all the parties involved.
The climber is certainly talented, but, as Pulis has mentioned several times, he has been on one side, here on the other side, for a long time, it has been visible that such relationships are not working.
Albion argues that it is necessary to sign the documents for the change before allowing the former member of the UK U-21 sample to go, but his 15 million worth of marching with Diafro Saho disappeared a few days before taking over, claiming to the club that he had passed a medical check and that everything had been agreed, but he had a backlog which would mean that he would have to release the beginning of the season.
This brings great pressure on the Venezuelan Solomon Rondo, who in the past season looked very nice, but he needs to improve the performance of his nine gates, especially if Rickie Lamberts continues to be so ineffective.
The decision to release Viktor Anicèbi and Stefan Sesegnoni in the retrospective also seems strange.
Pulis in his entire career is sadly famous with his slow new players moving up and three tunes - Jonathan Leko, Sam Fild and Taylor Roberts' appearance in the last season with undisclosed 1-1 with Liverpool, a lot or will become a norm.
He will return to those who have already tried and tested, but Leko is worth keeping in sight.
The 17-year-old assaulting halfguard generally participated in five games during the previous season, becoming the first to be the first to be born in 1999 in the Premierly, which is also highly valued in the English football system.
Matt Phillips, with a 5.5 million contract with Queens Park Rangers, will be fast, but he's the only new player who took part in the first week of the game.
It would not be safe to say if the end could be rather urgent.
"All," Pulis said in the past, "Express and Star about what would be improved.
Every position you see.
We need to strengthen the back players, the middle players in the field and the players in the front positions.
The goals are, we know what we want.
They appear to be much more difficult than expected, mainly because of the process of takeover.
The season could determine how they began, with seven to a great extent winning games before the difficult games with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.
At that time the pressure on Pulis will become less or less resistant.
And who knows, maybe even Berahino will find a new club.
Tata Steel UK is closer to the rescue transaction after the authorised changes in pensions
Apart from Tata Steel UK, the pension authorities said that the scheme could be restructured without involving the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) by increasing the company's ability to conclude a rescue transaction.
The British steel sector's pension scheme is committed to the amount of 15 billion pounds and is estimated to be at least 700 million pounds deficit, creating serious obstacles to the conclusion of a rescue transaction between Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot Steelworks in Wales.
Tata Steel is increasingly convinced of the business of Britain, which employs 11,000 people, to ensure the future after negotiations with the Minister of Economic Affairs and Pensions Regulator.
The company plans to combine its European activities, including Britain's business with ThyssenKrupp, the German conglomerate.
However, the conclusion of the transaction depends on whether the British steel pension scheme will be restructured and the government will provide financial support.
Alan Johnson, the pension president, said that the scheme could avoid the PPF if the benefits received by the employees were modified.
Although this is well funded in comparison with other schemes, with a deficit narrowed to 300 million pounds for individual measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp wants to control its liabilities.
Johnson said that the authorities recognize that it is "not real" to the joint venture or to any Tata Steel Uk we buy to assume responsibility for financing the current and future deficits.
The modification of the benefits obtained from the scheme was a much more binding option than the addition of the PPF, he added, where workers should accept the most advantageous conditions.
Tata Steel sources warn that it could still sell Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of steel mills, since the negotiations on the future of its business in the United Kingdom began in March, and this has been put in place as a brief in negotiations with the British government.
Kušik in Chatterje, Executive Director of Tata Steel Europe, said the Indian Conglomerate wants to make its steel business "more sustainable".
Speaking at the cool Tata Steel Annual Meeting in India, Chatterie said that the negotiations on the restructuring of pension schemes were moving forward, but he argued that the scheme was well funded.
"We are talking to various stakeholders, including the British Government and other stakeholders, such as the Wales Government, etc."
There is an opinion that pensions have a known impact on goods such as steel business, so we need to find a structural solution that does not lead the business forward.
The authorised wish to cooperate in the negotiations on the restructuring of the scheme will be supported by Tata Steel.
The potential changes in the scheme include a reference to how the increase in annual inflation-based benefits is measured from the retail price index to the lowest consumption price index, and limiting future pension payments to the minimum laid down in the law.
Johnson added: "The CEO and its advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and pension regulator with evidence of the scheme's ability to pay modified benefits for an indefinite period and a low level of risk outside the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the funding position of the scheme has not affected the decline in the market for last-time securities in the same way as in other UK pension schemes. We are still convinced that the scheme is capable of providing benefits at a self-sufficient level.
CBS commenter joins Michael Felps and Rayen Lohti in all lengths of competition
The comment of the Canadian radio organization CBC The Olympic Games on Thursday evening caused anger by mixing Michael Felps with his competitor Rayen Lohti.
Eliot Friedmans both enjoyed all 200 m of individual swimsuits, where Felps won by honoring his 22nd Olympic gold medal.
When Felps crossed the line, Friedman held him for Lohti, the Felps people, and already the old competitors of the world’s swimmers at the top of the top.
Friedman called out, "Of course he will!"
Rains Lohte will beat Michael Felps in this game!
Felps could not even get to the honor of the pedestal.
But Felps won, but Lohte finished fourth.
Immediately after Felps was in the gold, the CBS passed quietly.
In a miraculous way, the friar even admitted his mistake.
I'm sorry, I'm mixing the roads.
Felps with gold," he said.
The Canadian commentator, whose professionalism was widely appreciated by mistake, once again acknowledged his mistake and apologized to the viewers on the tweet within hours of the event.
I'm all sorry.
I'm surprised.
"No justification," he wrote.
At the time, Felps survived 2 168 years of record as the ever-greater Olympic winner.
The previous record belonged to Leonidad of Rhode Island, who had won more Olympic titles in the ancient Olympics than anyone else.
Russian hackers attacked the former NATO power commander's computer.
The hackers published General Philip Brydlov's lists and data on one of the Soros funds.
The same hackers, who had been able to have carried out an attack on the US Democratic Party's e-mails and published its lists, could also be guilty of a new series of attacks, reports Bloomberg.
Following its information, these cyber attacks have been carried out by these cyber-attacks on the list of former NATO Commander General Filip Bridlov and the services of the Open Society Institute, which are part of the projects supported by the millionaire George Soros.
The authors have published the information obtained in the DCLeaks.com link.
There is a list and data on the activities of the Open Society Institute.
It is reported that hackers have had access to the Fund's computers for about a year.
The news agency claims that this is about the same hackers that attacked the U.S. Democratic Party's computers that are run by the Russian Specialist.
The U.S. Investigator has already warned high-level officials of Congress about a possible hacker attack on the Democratic Party.
The news agency "Reuters" reports that it has information that at the time a number of politicians have told them - cyber attacks are coordinated by two Russian intelligence officers or their controlled organisations.
Congressmen, however, were unable to pass this information on to the victims of cybercrime because it was hidden.
The scandal for attacks on the Democratic Party's computers began after about 20,000 e-mails were published online, written by the party's representatives during the US presidential election campaign.
The party candidate, Hilaria Clintone, announced that the release of these letters was organised by Russian shipping companies.
Russian President Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov has announced that Russia has no connection with cyberterrorists.

Disneyland has come up with information about its long planned site structure, consisting of a transport hub and a new pedestrian bridge to the east side of the park.

Two thirds of its population will have to be accepted for heating in Liepaja’s home.
If the owners of the apartment are very deaf and specifically talking about the technical condition of the building, if there is such an opportunity to receive support and the building by arranging all possible means, it is quite easy not to use it.
One of the most important changes is the fact that EU co-financing from this year on can be obtained from any multi-dwelling house, only the condition is that the façade of the building must be necessarily heated.
In the past, it could be used only in a series of multi-dwelling houses.
The largest housekeepers will be able to organize the meetings of the owners of the apartments.
The important problem where this process is currently being collected is that 67% of apartment owners are required to agree.
"The previous programme required 51%," says SIA "The Home Manager of Liepaja" (LNA) project manager Toms Čírulis.
"Of course, it is very difficult to ensure this because, in most collections, the number of owners of such apartments does not occur," said project manager Gints Ločmelis of the "Home Service APSE" project.
The largest housekeepers in Liepaja - "Home Service APSE" and LNA, which operate around 900 buildings, plan to renovate at least 50 multi-dwelling homes during the new programming period by 2020.
They do not rule out the possibility that it will be difficult at the start of the work to convince people to vote for renovation work, but the behaviour of the citizens of each project implemented should be improved.
I also needed a bank loan, 76% of the population.
"I mean, explaining what will be - but I signed them," says the oldest Vita Izalniece of the most energy efficient buildings in Latvia.
She agrees with John, who also lives in a warm building.
Well, it can't be that the side is making up, and the other side plus one person doesn't agree.
"No, of course, it is important that everyone agrees with the whole measure," says Janis.
The representatives of the ALTUM financial institution have proposed an amendment to such provisions.
They explain that 51% of the number of votes in banks is not possible to attract the necessary funding, which has also been experienced during the last programming period.
Most commercial banks require two thirds of the owners of apartments.
As one of the recommendations for housekeepers, the head of Anda Lagzdini’s European Union funds department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has the opportunity to present the population with the existing examples and various benefits that will come from the renovation of the building, such as energy saving.
In the new world, Aaron had a long history of his mother’s death.
A potential suicide bomber's arrest operation in Canada was worthy of the press film.
It all started when the Canadian police received a video taken by the US Federal Investigation Office.
Very early this morning, the Royal Police of Canada received reliable information from the Federal Investigation Office.
Among other things, it contained the so-called "school" video recorded by an unknown person who was clearly in the final stage of the attack.
"And he was going to work it with a self-adhesive spark," said Deputy Chief of Police of Canada, Mike Kabana.
In the video black mask, a man dressed in English and Arabic posed threats to Canadians and promised to act on everything they had done to Muslims.
Within about three hours, using facial and voice recognition software, the Canadian police have managed to recognize this man.
It was 24-year-old Aaron Driver.
He was already under the supervision of the Probation Service about celebrating the idea of terrorism and radical Islam on the Internet.
The judgment of the Court of Justice prohibited Driver from continuing to do so and also from engaging in any radical organisation.
However, the authorities did not, until then, consider that the Driver could create a physical threat to the environment.
When the police arrived at his apartment in Stratro, in the province of Ontario, the new man came out and sat in a taxi.
At that time, the guards tried to arrest him, but the driver, sitting on the back seat, had a spark.
To prevent the detonation of the second spray, policemen shot the new man.
He's dead from the trauma.
The taxi driver is not stiff.
The neutralized terrorist father, Wayne Driver, told Canadian television that his son had turned to Islam in his teens.
It had initially helped him to deal with drugs and alcohol.
Yet, Aaron was a troubled teenager who was a long - term nymph to the world about his mother’s death.
Just when I saw the video today, I could see how far he had gone.
I didn't feel that he was so radical.
"But I also didn't know that he was so good at speaking Arabic," says Aaron's father.
Canadian police recognize that if they had arrived a few hours later, the development of events could have been much different.
Radeviča will go to Rio as a tourist and will support Latvian lighthouses.
The former Olympics and the Elegated Ineta Radeviča LTV in the Olympics said that the performance of seven sportsmen Laura Ikaunieces-Admidjan in the first two disciplines was not bad, given that the sportsman had a trauma.
On the other hand, Laura’s excrement was done with a good foot, not as usual with the left.
Radeviča pointed out that this is comparable - just as a person who has to write with the right hand would suddenly be forced to write with the left.
Therefore, the result of Ikauniece-Admidian in view of the trauma is not bad.
Radeviča discovered that he has not yet contacted Ikaunieci-Admidini, but actively followed with her beginnings and felt with her.
Ineta learned about Laura’s trauma recently and expressed support for the sportsman, stating that the delay did not begin to create a safety shield, but showed the character and the spirit of the fighter.
In other sports, Radeviča believes that the Olympic legislation is very high, so one of the Latvian athletes is to tell that he went to Rio as a tourist is wrong.
She recalled that even when she went to the first Olympics, where she fought 13th place, it was called a tourist, and it gave rise to negative emotions.
Ineta sometimes remembers its beginnings, not just the Olympics.
"I like to remember my emotions, not the results," said Radeviča, recalling his experience in sports.
She told me that it was always important for me to have someone in the courts who would give me the energy to share.
Raděvič will be a tourist this year - she will be going to Rio de Janeiro next week to support Latvian athletes on the spot.
She points out that she will definitely go to light-headed competitions.
Ineta Radeviča won the European Championship title in 2010.
In 2004 in the Olympics in Athens, she took 13 seats in the distance and 20 positions in the triple oil, but in 2008 the sportsman did not start because he was waiting for his son.
In London, Radeviči had a 4th place in the distance.
In the walls, the film "Quanta Code" will appear with physicists in Kašteev's main role.
The movie notes that in parallel with the electrolysis in the laboratory, Kašteevs is a dreamer, teacher, socially active and civilist thinking man and father who is looking for a link with Visvarano.
The film hero of Latvia's television broadcast "Rita Panorama" pointed out that he had had an interesting experience.
I found out how to top the movie, how to film it, how to record the sound.
"And really amazing work," said the physicist.
He recognized that the film had become two years old.
The biggest disputes with the directors were about the name of the film.
I am categorically against this name.
No quantity code.
"It is not a secret that could be known and is all clear when it comes to the film," added the professor associated with LU.
Kaštjevs admitted that he liked the fact that the movie’s premieres would be in the evening of Murjan’s film.
They are organized by friends from the foundation "Siegli", and these cinematics will take place every evening until 9 September.
In Thailand, four people were killed in bomb explosions at the sight of tourists
After the Thai people voted in favour of the adoption of the military-supported Constitution, Thursday and Friday in the five southern provinces of Thailand - in popular tourist destinations - a number of bomb explosions occurred, which killed four people and injured many people.
The first two explosions will take place at the seaside resort in Huahina on Thursday evening, next Friday morning.
The city is about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok.
The police reported that in the first explosion one Thai woman was killed and 20 people were injured, 10 of them were foreigners.
The authorities confirmed that other explosions occurred in the southern cities of Phuket, Tran and Surathan.
Two bombs explode in Phukutas in the town of Patonta and two more in Phan in the province - in the tourist region north of Phukuta.
During the last 24 hours, 11 bombs have exploded in Thailand.
On Friday, Colonel Krisana Patanačaroens of the Thai Royal Police Officer announced that the explosions were not related to Islamic extremists and were considered to be local acts of sabotage.
"It's still too early to make conclusions," he said.
"But we certainly know that these incidents are not directly linked to any kind of terrorism, in fact it is local sabotage, and we are trying to find guilty people."
After a small power bomb exploded in Huahin on 12 August 2016, the investigators gathered evidence from the crime scene.
On 12 August, officials announced that four people were killed in a series of bombings in important tourism areas in Thailand.
There are no conflicts in the country that could cause terrorists to be found in the country.
"That is why we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.
No group has yet assumed responsibility for the attack and no specific group has been accused by the competent authorities, but the explosion occurred the same week the Thai voters approved the new Constitution.
All three southern provinces - Huahina, Phuketa and Phannu - have rejected the military-supported referendum, and in the southern provinces of Thailand, where most of the population are Muslims, more than 6,500 people have been killed since the 2004 riots.
The event took place on the day of the birth of the King of Thailand, which is the day of the national holiday in Thailand.
The capital of the King is Klai Kangwon, or "city far from the roots", where the royal family of Thailand is often allowed to stay.
King Bumibol Adoljade was the most powerful monarch in the world.

Portugal and Besa - which we have earned a long time ago!
There are plenty of operas that have never been scanned in Latvia.
There's something very rare.
However, it seems to me that, since the 1970s, George Gürschvina’s grandfather, Porgy and Besa, has not been studied or replayed, unless the number of histomatic solo numbers such as Summertime’s periodic viewing (including ines Galante’s summer festival), some students’ projects, visits, and so on.
It has its own reasons - since Latvia has been a civilised Western state, it has binding rules and copyright licenses for the Göršvina family, which are valid for Portugal and Besu until 2030.
The harmonisation procedures are not simple.
Moreover, in making a full impression, the author wanted all fourteen soloists to be black people.
In Latvia, of course, the existing discussions and contexts of this opera in the US are not known and the composer's desire to perform would be difficult.
On 6 August, the concert stage created by the compromise, with four artists from black American soloists and their Latvian brothers and sisters, was staged on the 10th of July at the Cēsus Art Festival, reminding the beautiful sound of Göršvina, where her classical European music traditions with American jazz rhythms, ladies, early 20th-century fashion dances, and the remaining hits, as well as the famous Katfişrova Krupla Ubaga Porgya and a light tourene Besa lover in the musical quality of the documentary life story rings.
First, LNSO and Director Andra Pogas.
Despite the complex spatial location of the concert venue in the open-air park of Cēsu Castle, the orchestra was located next to the scene, on which the soloist and singer (and excellent singing!) choir While, the overall scan was stylisticly nuanced, the contrasts rich and accurate in both step-by-step and metal drums and piano parties (Martins Zilberts).
Second, because of the excellent soloist team.
The Harismatic Dramatic Barton Lester Linčs (Portugal) is a popular singer in Europe and America, whose repertoire includes both barton and basbarton parties, especially Verdi operas.
The role of Portugal has been played several times, as well as the Krauna - he felt as a fish in the water in this opera and inspired the audience's partners even at a concert to excite the emotional atmosphere of solidarity between the fishermen's habitats of poor people.
Latvia Mura in her second concert venue in Portugal and Besas (the first in 2012 was no more, no less than with Berlin Philharmonics and Ser Simone Retlu) found itself as a vital plastic vocal-style combination with a dramaticly toned theme and fantastic piano in the top register.
Not that she's one of the most famous today's Aidas.
Attractive Jamaican tennis player Germain Smitt, which Andris Poga has in his time intended to explore Boston, is the image of the drug dealer Sportinlifa, a company in four continents.
It demonstrates its synchronous singing and singing skills as well-trained music actor.
Smit is one of the rarely occurring cleans, which seems to be still hiding undiscovered vocal opportunities as 15 years ago when the opera’s voice was accidentally found, curing it to smear the unsuspecting ones.
It is unlikely that even from the 24th and relatively dark, German Smith’s expressive language allows him to see the dusty bag in his hands even if it is not there.
How could the poor Besa not follow such a mephistophilanthropist, who in vain has given in to the illusion of a wonderful life in New York?
The role of blood was created by Rodney Clarks, a gift - wrapped drummer.
The greatest vocal surprise in the team of Latvian soloists Cēsus was Sonora's child born Sirina - a proud upper register, a skilled balance between spoken and sung text, according to a change of voice position, a performance of vocal acrobatics and dramatism both in Sirina's favourite My Man is Gone Now and in the stylized chairman's prayer Oh, Doctor Jesus.
In clairvoyance, the voice of Margaritas Wilson was well-scanned, but the iconic Summertime itself sparked a bit of noise and nervousness as it gained its true character at its very beginning.
Colorites and spells were excavated by Mikhail Chuilpajev, Rihard Macanovski, Andrim Lapiņas (especially the Crab seller on the city walls in response to Irmas Pavāre's beautiful Soprano seller in the Soprano case).
Highlights of Ilonas Bagles, Riharda Miller, Emil Kivleniek's paintings, as well as of the roles discussed, where Ivo Martinson's founded investigator and white lawyer Extradiel's viewers were soon served by the director and actor Juris Žagars.
In the spatial design of the concert hall in Kairis, the chorus worked on the steps, mainly in the proscenia, rarely coming up or going on the steps.
In a rather dynamic operation, a small commissary situation led to the collection of maps in the hands of Latvian soloists.
Their presence, however, has a clear explanation.
First, some soloists performed several epic roles (sometimes created difficulties in tracking the identity of their audience).
Secondly, there are many dialogues in Portugal and Bessa, a spoken phrase, a replica, which is easier to track with in front of the scenes.
Listeners were very helpful in using the title machine in Cēsis’s action.
The weather was low and the first part of the concert was long enough.
However, it did not stop most of the audience from staying until the end to entertain artists.
Nine evenings, however, are quite a time to start full-length operas, especially if a longer journey from Cēsis is expected, but opera Porgis and Besa have returned to Latvia's music course and will probably become one of the most exciting music experiences of this summer.
Also in Liepaja, where it ran out in the evening and in other acoustic conditions.
In the Russian field, the man was afraid of the children with the worms.
Yesterday, 11 a.m., at eight o’clock in the evening, the State police received news from a scared mother of a child, who was upset that a man in the street of Lomonosova, in a child’s field, was in fear of children.
The law enforcement immediately responded to the call and arrived at the scene, where the man met with a worm, who was in a very high alcohol state at the time of the event - 3.07 miles [3.07 km].
It was found that a man born in 1962 had already feared children so that they would not become pregnant.
This time, however, an aggressive man used a ball to hit the child’s field.
The man was arrested.
In connection with the ongoing criminal proceedings, there has been a serious disturbance in the public order, which is manifestly disrespectful to the public or to the public, ignoring generally accepted standards of conduct and disrupting human peace.
Such a crime shall be punishable by the withdrawal of liberty for a period of up to two years, or by the withdrawal of temporary liberty, or by forced labour, or by the penalty of money, and by the supervision of the trial for a period of up to three years.
The presidents of the feds in the Olympics usually use guest accreditations.
The presidents of the sports federations usually come to the Olympics for a few days and use the guest accreditations that allow them to change their names, so they have several owners during the competition, LETA told the agency the representative of the Latvian Olympic Unit (LOV).
On Wednesday, extensive axioms were caused by the remarks made by the Olympic swimmer Alonas Ribakovas coach, German Jakubovska, who discovered that at the last moment in Riodezaneiro Olympics, the leader of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) Kaspars Pone, decided to go home.
Later it became known that Mr. Brasil had come with coach accreditation, which the president himself said surprised, because "there is no place in it now".
As Vilciņa said, in the London Olympics, only two federation presidents - Pone, as well as the leader of the Latvian Biellatic Union (LVS) of Guntis Zālitis, lived in the sport village.
In the Olympic village, sportsmen live as well as officials, including coaches, doctors, the administration of the delegation.
Therefore, it is likely that London Ponem was also accredited as a coach.
"The former federation presidents come as guests, and they have different accreditations - they come for a few days and then use someone else," said Vilciņa, explaining that the presidents of these federations do not live in the Olympic village either.
Mr. Riodezaneiro arrived at the end of July, leaving Brazil on 13th, and he will probably be there the easiest of the presidents of all the national federations.
Significantly, Latvia started only one day in the swim on 10th of August.
Latvia Riodezaneiro will be represented in 11 sports games, and the Agency's LETA calculations show that the presidents of six or seven federations will go to the four-quarters' most important competitions.
Zālitis will be in Brazil on Saturday, President Igo Japiņš of the Latvian Rising Federation (LRF) will be attending the BMX scheduled next week, President of the Latvian Windsörfing Federation Ansis Dāle planned to fly to Rio de Janeiro on 16th, when the beginnings of Katija Birzulei have already ended, but the President of the Russian Federation Dzintars Urbančiks - the day before.
The next week, too, the president of the Latvian Shooting Federation, Kārlis Krēsliņš, also planned to join, when the shooting of Dainim Uppelnik has already ended.
The president of the Latvian Judo Federation, Raymond Rublovskis, at least during the Latvian sports competition, did not find Riodežaniro, although his arrival was planned, but the Latvian Canoe Federation is currently not the president, but there will still be an ongoing conflict in the Latvian society and its athletes will submit to the international competitions by the Latvian Olympic Committee.
Meanwhile, the president of the Latvian Volajbola Federation Atis Sausnītis and the head of the Latvian Tennis Union, Juris Savickis, decided not to join Riodezaneiro.
Vasilijev assesses the natural breast of Latvian women.
The world famous Russian fashion historian, interior decorator, screenwriter, book writer, reader and collector Aleksandr Vasilijev has been visiting Latvia for the last few years.
Recently, he finally praised the competitors "Mis and Misters Latvija 2016" and acknowledged that Latvian artists, unlike the Russians, may be proud of natural breasts and lips that have not been improved with silicone and botulinal injections.
In a conversation with "Vakara News", Aleksandr Vasilijev said that for years the jury has been in the popular beauty competition "Mis Russia".
That is why he was very interested also in evaluating the participants "Mis and Misters Latvia 2016".
In order to distinguish the standards of Latvian beauty competition from similar competitions in Russia, Vasilijev stressed that Latvians and Russians have a completely different figure: "Krevije's participants have a double breast unlike Latvian competitors."
However, young Latvians are beautifully dressed and fried, as well as can be proud of natural beauty, not of the wonders performed by plastic surgery.
I therefore particularly congratulate the participants of the Latvian beauty competition with their natural beauty.
In connection with its professional activity in Latvia, Vasiljev has great plans.
At present, a collection of fashion historian's exhibition "Privacy of Nature" is viewed at the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design.
On the other hand, in Ventspil, in the Livonian Palace, the exhibition Vasiljeva "Caesque Dresses 1860-2010".
Vasiliev loved Ventspili so much that he also enjoyed the hospitality of the city for a few days and walked along the sea.
I like Latvia very much.
It is especially now, when there is a threat of terrorism across Europe, that there is a real paradise.
"To spend time and rest in Latvia is a pure pleasure," the fashion guru acknowledged.
In addition, on November 23, Alexander Vasilijev opened a private fashion museum.
Please help!
Please donate to our son, our brother, for the treatment of the child.
We, the Rinalda family, are grateful to the amazing people around us and to God that there was a chance to save Rinalda, but unfortunately, at present there is no possibility of fully covering the medical costs of herself.
Rinald Grinbergs is 11 years old and is diagnosed with brain tumors at the end of July.
This year he graduated from the fourth grade in the elementary school of Milzkalne with excellence, a powerful sportsman and a very talented artist.
He seems to have given him everything.
A healthy, lively, unrelenting, diligent and active boy.
Always funny and nice.
On July 26, our family will remain in memory of life.
During the last few weeks, I had a history of nausea, headaches, but my doctor gave it to the abdominal virus.
And at first it seemed that it did.
Because who could have imagined that such "innocent" symptoms of guilt are much more serious than the thought of inexplicable.
On July 26, we received a diagnosis - Rinaldam is a brain tumor.
Fast storage fluids in the brain, but all that doctors can help in Latvia is to perform a sewer operation to transfer excess fluid, because direct surgery is not available to the grower.
It is also not possible to determine whether the farmer is benign or malicious.
Next national plan: start radiation and see what happens.
Like in a bad dream - we'll experiment here, we'll look at the results.
Fortunately, Rinalda’s investigations resulted in an opportunity to show the results to the doctor in Spain.
He is the Vice President of the World Neurosurgery Association, one of the world's leading neurosurgery.
He took the surgery, and it turned out that he had to operate immediately.
The farmer creates enormous pressure on the brain, and the risk of complications is too high.
It is also urgent to understand whether the farmer is benign or malicious in order to develop a plan for further treatment.
Not immediately, the parents chose to go to Spain to save his son.
At a fantastic rate, on August 8, Rinald and his mother, Evie, were in Spain and operated on August 9.
A very complex surgery was performed, more than 6 hours long.
The operation took place at Santa Elena's clinic.
The majority of the tumours were removed, the pressure decreased, the samples were obtained.
Rinald is already on his way from bed, and as a regular teenager, he asks for fri potatoes in the evening.
The results of oncology analysis should now be expected.
Thank you to Dr. Araez and the management of the clinic, who understood the situation and operated quickly without receiving a full fee for treatment prior to surgery.
They hoped that the remaining amount would be paid, only requested EUR 10,000 for the first contribution to operate and save Rinalda's life.
6,000 euros were made available to parents by selling machinery, but the other necessary amounts for travel, living, and hospital first contribution were made to borrow from their relatives and friends.
But at least 24,000 euros is needed to calculate the first treatment phase in Spain and to deliver the money we have borrowed for the first contribution.
Please help us to repay this, Rinalda's health as important, surgery.
Each euro is important to help cover the costs of the operation already carried out and to enable Rinalda to continue its treatment successfully.
The signs of unrest in Ukraine raise the question: What about Vladimir Putin’s advice?
It is worth considering the truth of these claims.
Ukraine rejects them, and the US and the European Union argues that Russia has not provided any evidence.
An open-ended analysis group, Digital Forensic Research Lab, has found some signs of Saturday's interrogation, but quite little to prevent Moscow's major plans.
Russia is known for distorting events or for misinterpretations for political purposes, particularly in the context of the continuing conflict in Ukraine.
This does not mean, however, that all Russian claims are unfounded.
Ukraine's opposition forces broke the powerpillars supplying Crimea last year, and some of them are also involved in criminal activities and human rights violations.
The attempt to attack in Crimea remains a topical issue, although there is little doubt that the Ukrainian government would sponsor the scenario of such events.
Whatever happens, the images found by the open source analysts show that Russia has been increasing its military presence since at least last Saturdays - before the expected attack.
They show how they move halfway to the heavy-arms convoy, including missile systems for the protection of the coast.
Russia’s Famous Exaltation
Some reports show that the Russian forces in Crimea had already been scheduled for a rotation that could help explain the activity, although it would be very convenient that it was simply expected to occur at one of the most stressful times since the 2014 annexation.
In order to make it known at the end of the week, Mr Putin has undoubtedly taken even more of his remarks to Ukraine by choosing to use this episode to the extent that it is also realistic for a greater purpose.
Analysts point to disturbing parallels with how Russia dealt directly before the previous military action against Ukraine.
In February 2014, similar talks and military maneuvers provided the protection of members of the Crimean Voluntary Opposition Forces from taking part in the half-story that Ukraine was still in control of, only to reveal that they were in fact the Russian special units that started the military occupation.
In August when Russian-supported separatists did not take place in the Eastern Ukraine, Putin deployed forces along the border, warning that they might be needed for the "protection" of the ethnic Russian civilians in Ukraine, which he said was attacked.
He organized a convoy of aid to a region that, according to NATO information, was only protected by Russian invasion forces.
What is Mr Putina planning to do in Crimea?
Some have suggested that Moscow alone does not plan another military intervention.
The fight in Eastern Ukraine has intensified, just as it was before the attack in August 2014.
But this seemingly parallel could be the point where fear of military action is to be introduced, not of actual action, - it will bring Putin short relations with both Ukraine and the Western countries.
Mark Galeoti, Professor of the University of New York, who is investigating Russia, pointed out that Crimea would be of small importance as a point from which military action against East Ukraine, which is bordering the Russian territory rather than Crimea, and that the rest of the country is better protected.
"There is a very small possibility if the Russians are really planning a major offensive," Mr Galeoti said.
Rather, "we can observe a classic Russian strategy in creating pressure."
The international peace negotiations on Ukraine, which was once a mechanism with which Putin stressed contacts with Western leaders who ignored him because of the annexation of Crimea, are increasingly considered to be ineffective and irrelevant.
Assuming that there is a threat that the conflict can be resolved again, Putin gives us a new idea for the negotiations: to get her off the edge of the abyss.
"This is the standard Putina tactics - he wants to try to start from the force position," Galeoti said about the next peace talks, scheduled at the beginning of September.
"And the only strong side is to say, "If I wanted to, I could do it much, much worse."
To reach agreement with the West
Putin also said this week that during the struggles in Crimea it was not important to continue the negotiations by making the other parties convince them to return to the negotiating table and to come to the centre of the process.
What does that really give him?
Firstly, it enables Russia to continue to be strengthened as a world power, although its economies are smaller than Australia.
Secondly, it positions Moscow as having veto rights regarding Ukraine's sovereignty, to a certain extent maintaining the State under Russian control.
This can also benefit Putina's long-standing hopes for a broad-ranging agreement with the United States to resolve their disputes on the issue of Ukraine and Syria, with the favourable conditions of Moscow, of course - also by ending Western sanctions against Russia.
Since the deterioration of the state economy in 2014, a number of houses have been identified, mainly as a result of a decrease in the value of national oil and gas exports.
Since the invasion in Syria last autumn, he has repeatedly called upon the Western authorities to join him in the great coalition of extremists.
However, the Russian leaders may consider that they would need to ensure such an agreement before January when President Obama's term of office ends.
The Russian officials believe that the next president will be Hilaria Clinton, who is more hostile to Moscow.
Donald J. Tramps, although he is apparently friendly with Russia, is still considered unforeseeable.
Obama, on the other hand, is considered to be one who "seeks solutions, not conflicts," Galeoti said.
So it is wise to close the window of opportunity to get something done quickly.
In the meantime, if a broad agreement cannot be reached, Putin seems to be satisfied with the preservation of Russia's weak neighbour by mentioning what will be further.
In the earlier version of this article, the year Russia invaded Crimea from Ukraine was incorrect.
This took place in 2014, not in 2013.
When the convention arrived on the road, the White House spent its resources fighting Zika’s virus
The Obama administration said Thursday that it would send 81 million US dollars from biomedical research and anti-poverty and health care programmes to pay for the Zika virus vaccine, due to the fact that Congress did not approve new funding for the fight against the virus.
Silvija Metjus Barvela , Secretary of Health and Human Services, in a letter to the Congress, indicated that without the funds allocated, the National Institute of Health and the Biomedical Research and Development Authority would remain free of money to fight the disease of leather transmitted by the end of the month.
Therefore, the development of the vaccine should be discontinued at an important time, as the number of cases of Zikas in the country increased by Maiami.
Last week, 7 350 Zikas virus cases were reported in the United States, mostly in Puerto Rico (according to the control and prevention centre data).
Ms. Barvelas said that 15 infants were born with Zika's virus-related birth defects.
The virus may cause brain development abnormalities and other serious defects in infected mothers.
The spread of the disease in the continental part of the United States, when the first cases were recorded at the end of last month, has raised the political rates for the federal government's reaction.
Hillary Clinton stopped during the campaign on Tuesday in Vainvud, Miami, where there was a local outbreak of Zika's virus, and pressured Congress to return from a five-week break to confirm emergency funding for the fight against the virus.
President Obama and the Republics of Congress have been in conflict with most of the year's Zika virus.
In February Obama requested $1.9 billion for emergency funding.
The Republicans stopped it by requesting a more detailed report on the use of the money.
Legislators have been arguing for months about how much money should be allocated and how it should be spent.
Last month, the Democrats blocked the review of the proposed measure by the Republicans when US$ 1.1 billion was allocated to the fight against Zika's virus, but included conditions prohibiting the granting of funds for family planning for the provision of contraceptives in connection with a virus that can be so transferred on the way of birth.
Because of this collision, the White House in April was forced to send $589 million, which was intended to fight Ebola virus, to fight Zika virus. About two thirds of funding is intended to be used within the country.
On Thursday, Mrs Barvelas said that her department had spent most of the money and that it would be spent in full by the end of August.
"The failure to take a decision on emergency funding for the fight against Zika virus has led the administration to choose between the suspension of the work of the important vaccine development and the retention of other valuable national programmes in order to temporarily avoid this suspension," Barvela wrote.
The Democrats agreed with this statement to transfer additional money to the Republicans for the fight against Zika's virus.
At the news conference, the representative of Nensija Pelosi from California, a minority leader, invited the representative of Poland D.Raien, the Speakers of the House of Representatives, to remind Congress of the continuation of this measure.
"All possibilities are exhausted, and now we are looking at the National Institute of Health," said Mrs Pelosi.
Mr. Rayena's advisors say that the transfer of funds is a step that had to be stopped long ago and that Obama's administration has withdrawn the maximum political benefit from Zika's virus problem.
Last week, the National Institute of Health announced that there has been a clinical trial of Zika virus vaccines with 80 people, and hopes to start the second phase of the Zika virus epidemic in early 2017.
However, as officials said Thursday, the study will stop without any immediate additional funding.
Barvela said that she would send 34 million US dollars to fight Zika virus from the National Health Service for the search of medicines to treat other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
Another 47 million will be transferred to the Biomedical Research and Development Authority, which supports the development of medicinal products and vaccines in response to emergencies in the field of public health.
This money will come from several accounts, including 19 million US dollars from a programme that grants small-scale subsidies to small families, and 4 million US dollars from drug dependence programmes, such as opioids.
Even as Barvel said, additional money will only be sufficient for the next month, when the agencies come to "reasonably narrow up their activities" in the fight against Zika's virus, if the Congress does not act.
Over the last four months, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has spent 60 million US dollars to help the states protect pregnant women, 25 million US dollars to strengthen their preparedness for Zika virus and plans to fight it, and 16 million US dollars to help it establish data recovery systems to quickly detect microcephalus and other symptoms associated with Zika virus.
The Thai leader connects attacks to the favorite sites of tourists with constitutional changes
The leader of the Thai huntas called on the public to be patient on Friday until the investigators found out what was behind this week’s deadly bomb blasts in Thailand.
General Prajuts Çan-oč, Hontas leader and Prime Minister, said that criminals have been "bad people", protesting against the new Constitution approved by the voters in the Sunday referendum.
"There are still bad people, and they worked before the referendum," he said to the people.
The bombings in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including Phuket and Huahin, in the middle of tourists, killed four people and injured two people.
The authorities of the country of origin claim that the attacks by the firefighters are linked elsewhere.
Analysts claim that the bomb explosions were not intended to kill many people, but to harm the tourism sector, one of the highlights of the Thai economy.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Huanhin.
"Whatever the motive, explosions and attacks by the firefighters surround the hunta's claim that the post-referencing situation will be stable," said Sunajs Fasuks, the senior researcher of the Human Rights Watch.
These attacks result in discrediting the authorities, terrorising society and harming the tourism-based economy.
Photo of Thailand rescue service staff are providing a bomb blast in Huahin on Friday.
The police claim that in their view these explosions are not related to international terrorism or prolonged Islamic unrest in southern Thailand.
They consider attacks on "local sabotage", not terrorism.
A strong political symbol for the time and location of the selected attack.
The event took place on Friday, when people had prepared to celebrate the birthday of Queen Syrikat, which is considered Mother’s Day in Thailand.
Four explosions took place in Huahin, a city of royal residence, about 125 miles from Bangkok, where there were also most injured.
The Constitution prepared by the military will reduce the influence of political parties and grant military powers even if the government is again under civilian control.
Hunta helped to ensure its victory without allowing opponents to campaign against it.
Mureis Hübert, South-East Asia expert at the Strategic and International Studies Centre in Washington, pointed out that the attacks had been committed by people who were not satisfied with the vote.
The signs were "precisely coordinated, but the eyes are clearly aimed at creating fear and confusion, not mass damage and damage and injury," he said.
Last year, 20 people, mostly tourists from China, were killed at the popular Erevan church in Bangkok.
The Thai officials linked the explosions with Uighur warriors, who were dissatisfied with the return of more than 100 Uighur to China.
General Preijuts, who has been running together since 2014 when the business was abandoned by the civilian government, said that this week's explosions "pain the heart of the Tayamites."
Why now, when the country is getting better, when the economy is getting better, and the tourism sector is getting better?" he said.
We have to ask why and who did it.
Gold Reaction: As Simones Manuel's historic moment looked back
As I begin the fight tonight, I try to remove the gravity of the black community from my shoulders, which is something that I am not with me simply in such a position.
However, I hope that will all be gone.
I am more than happy that I can serve others as an inspiration and, hopefully, in different forms of sport.
At the same time, however, I would like to be the day when we have more, and it is not Simone, a black swimmer, because the term in the black swimmer makes it look like I should not be able to fight the gold medal or that I should not be able to master the records.
It's not because I'm working as hard as everyone else, and I love sports and I want to win like everyone else.
The fight for students - the protection of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders (L.G.B.T.) in Colombia
Two years ago, 16-year-old Sergio Urrego left the shopping center in Bogotá, before leaving a message about his suicide on Facebook, quoting Pink Floyd's song "Goodbye Cruel World".
Her death was the beginning of a conflict that arose this week in Colombia, where efforts to extend the rights of L.G.B.T. were seen in the broader political struggles that divided the country into two camps.
After his death, the mother, Alba Reijes, filed a complaint against the officials of the school, blaming them for the exclusion of her only son when it was found that he and his class had intimate relations.
A year later, the Colombian Supreme Court ruled in favour of her, inviting schools across the country to develop a clearer policy to prevent discrimination.
The decision was part of a series of legal victories for the gay rights movement in Colombia. A year ago, the movement celebrated the decision to legalize marriage.
However, this week in their struggle for equality, they faced an obstacle, as Jean Perody, a minister of education, who is openly gay, became a scandal about the application of this rule in the scandal.
The scandal began when the social media began to circulate sexually exposed content from the porn magazine, distributing talks that it was part of the textbook issued by the Ministry of Education.
Perody's doing it.
Although the Ministry offered help to schools on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity with a view to helping them focus on the rule, it did not try to impose the standard rules.
"What we want for schools is tools for dealing with conflicts," said Mrs Perdodia on Thursday in the interview.
The debate began before the national debate on the future of the country where peace negotiations between the government and the revolutionary Colombian armed forces, or FARC, will be fought by a group of partisans.
The political coalition and the leaders of the Catholic Church in opposition to the government have been extremely quickly mobilized, accusing President Juan Manuel Santos of promoting one sex union and gender change.
To make it even more difficult, a government delegation participating in negotiations with FARC in Havana recently reached an agreement on gender and the equality of L.G.B.T., calling for more inclusive policies.
The government's criticism and peace negotiations, which have attracted 42-year-old Perody, Colombia's leading star.
They demonstrated a pair of posters in the camps, and some have also threatened to resort to violence against them and their partners, Cecilia Alvaresa-Correa Glen, former trade ministers.
Perodya kept a wonderful peace throughout the week, trying to correct the mistake and restart the debate with constructive conditions.
"Partly what makes me stand and keep my head clear is the awareness that there are children who will only be discovered," she said.
This is a very tight field and a very simple time.
She also pointed out the link between the peace process and the debate on L.G.B.T. students.
While the Colombians continue to assess the benefits of a transaction with FARC, which would be a turning point for the country as an earthquake, they have to think about the rise of the conflict, she said.
"Is there a state of peace that promotes inclusion or exclusion; or is it where everyone has equal opportunities?" she asked.
Even though this week she was not happy to be the target of insults and harassment, she is pleased that today gay students in Colombia can take an example from her and think that they can also try to become ministers someday.
"I am very important that they are calm and realize that they can fully realize their potential," said Mrs. Perody.
We can't wait for a new suicide to start something change.
Do you want to save your vote in cybersecurity - The New York Times
"ASV is looking for ways to keep hackers per piece from election urns" (news article, August 4th)
Minister of Internal Security, Jehs Johnson, says the Obama administration is thinking of additional protection of the security of the national electoral system.
These changes may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
In the various manifestations and recent revelation that foreign forces may be national states are increasingly interested in the influence of our elections, the federal government demands that further attention be paid to the provision of our electoral system and perhaps part of our country's essential infrastructure.
Johnson should immediately contact thousands of national jurisdictions that assist in the election and offer the assistance, consultation and management of the Department of Homeland Security.
While the diverse and diverse nature of our voting infrastructure prevents efforts to ensure it, it tells us that the process should start as soon as possible.
The author, a Democrat from Mississippi, is a member of the High-level National Security Committee.
A boy injured in a carousel in Pennsylvania, this week the third case of attracting parks
On Thursday, after a car accident, a boy won and was taken to Pittsburgh's hospital. The Rapid Assistance Service and Park Officers say this is the third incident this week in the U.S. attracting parks where children suffered.
A child whose name is not revealed was taken to a children’s hospital in Pittsburgh, about 50 miles (80 km) west of Aidwailda and Soukzona Park in Lajjonjer, Pennsylvania, said a quick assistance representative of the Westmurland area.
The three-year-old boy who visited with his brother while he was being helped on the spot was aware by the e-mail of the park representative Jeff Krushors.
Krušor said the attraction "Rollo Coaster" will be closed for the investigation period.
Children in Aidwaild must be at least 3 feet (91 cm) long in order to be able to visit the carousel, and those who are less than 4 feet (122 cm) should be accompanied by adults.
The withdrawal, according to the information published on its website, was built in 1938, and the Department of Agriculture indicated that it was examined in August.
The representative of the hospital refused to comment on the condition of the boy.
On Sunday of the neck injury that will come from the world’s highest water mountain in Kansas, Kansas, a 10 - year - old boy died.
On Monday, three 6, 10 and 16 - year - old girls who fell from more than 30 feet (9 m) in the hospital were delivered to the hospital, while the local media reported on the change of the panoramic wheel during the annual market in Greenville, Tennessee.
Japanese Prime Minister Abe World War II will not visit the temple in which the memory of the war is respected: Jiji
The news agency Jiji reports that the Prime Minister of Japan, Sindho Abe, will not visit the Holy See of Tokyo during the Second World War on an annual anniversary, which honors the memory of the war.
Thursday, however, you reported that Abe was planning on Monday to send a ritual gift to Jasukuni for the anniversary.
The temple also honors 14 Japanese caravans, who are only convicted as war criminals, and China and South Korea consider it a symbol of the military regime of Japan.
Both have not visited the temple since December 2013, when he announced that he has visited to show respect for those who love his birth.
In the new Japanese defence minister, Tomomi Inada has not answered the question whether she will visit the temple, explaining that it is a question of conscience.
Inanda - near Abe, a supporter of the pacifist constitution of Japan - regularly visited Jasukuni in the past.
The news agency Kyodo reports that on Thursday, Masahiro Imamura, the Minister of Reconstruction of the Territories affected by the Japanese disaster visited the temple and said he was praying for Japan's peace and prosperity.
Relations between China and Japan, Asia's two largest economies, have become more strained following the ever-increasing presence of China's coastal guards and other rival islands in the South Sea, which are called Senkaku in Japan, and China as Diaudzu in China.
Sustained two suspects in planning the terrorist acts of Rio Olympics: police
On Thursday, the police arrested two people suspected of supporting the Islam State group in planning a possible attack during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Prior to Thursday, the police had already arrested 12 people, all suspected of cooperation with the Islamic state fighters.
The Brazilian federal police report that three more persons were arrested and later released.
The two prisoners are Brazilians on Thursday, but the police do not reveal their names and other information.
Although there have been no conflicts with known fighting groups in the history of Brazil, the government reports that the Olympics have made the country a more up-to-date goal, in particular because of the participation of countries fighting the Islamic State.
They are controlled by individual Iraqi and Syrian territories, and the US-led coalition has launched air attacks against them.
The group has supporters all over the world, who have been in the process of instigating and disarming civilians.
The French priest officially charges the murder of the new suspect
During the investigation of the murder of the French priest last month, official charges were brought against the man arrested on Monday, and on Friday Reuters reported a source of information to the police.
A 21-year-old suspect is being investigated in cooperation with terrorists, and he has been planning attacks on people, the source of information mentioned.
The man was contacted by telephone with Adele Kermich and Abde Malik Petitdjan, who stopped church service in Sentetjên du Ruve, West France, on July 26, and crossed the line to Father James Amel, an 85 - year - old Roman Catholic teacher.
Both policemen were in a hurry.
The suspect had left his home not far from Tuluz, on the Senate du Ruva and spent the night there before the attack, mentioned the source.
The young man, who had not previously been convicted, admitted that he spent the night there, but told the investigator that he was away the next day because he did not have a good relationship with Kermit and Petitdjan, said a source of information.
The investigators are trying to determine whether Kermic and Petitdjan were participants in France and whether they were related to the Islamic State that has assumed responsibility for the attack.
At the end of last month, a pre-trial detention was applied to the brother of Petitdjan.
Doruss de Vriess, before moving to Celtic, undergo medical tests
Nottingham Forest Club guard Doruss de Vriess has arrived in Glázgov, as he hopes to reach an agreement on the transfer to Celtic.
De Vriess was photographed, entering Roshol's hospital before medical examination after Hope agreed on conditions with the Sky Bet Champions Club.
Parkhead Club leader Brendan Rodgers is looking for an experienced centre protection to compete for Craig Gordon's current first number.
Tommert Rogers is 35 years old, since he and the Dutchman worked together at the Swansea Club.
He played 51 games in Swansea, which they played under Rogers’ leadership in 2011 and fought the right to move to the Premierlīg.
He has changed the form of greetings to join the "Vilkis", and since 2013 has been City Ground.
During his career, he also played in Scotland after the Diunfermline season, after moving back in 2006.
His stay in Estonia ended with a crash, however, Pars experienced a double agonist, being "sended in triumph" from the highest level, before losing at the Celtic Scotland Cup.
The guard under the contract had still remained a year in the forest composition, and it was reported that Celtic would only have to pay a nominal fee to get his signature.
Macy's gonna close 100 stores.
The big store giant Macy's announced Thursday about its plans to close 100 shops, which is a dramatic step to help the shop chain get ahead of the potentially simmering problem: In America, it claims, there is too much shop for online shopping for the lake.
Macy's regularly reduces its shop portfolio, often closing several dozen insufficiently profitable shops immediately after the annual holiday trip.
However, following its summer announcement that it will close 15 per cent of its 728 trading venues, shop chains seem to have taken a much more aggressive position than many similar representatives of the retail sector in terms of reducing its turnover by adapting to the highly variable purchasing environment.
Soldiers and buyers go to Macy's store in New York.
The retail giant announces that it plans to close 100 shops.
Macy's has a lot of reasons to try to change: many of its shops are located in small regional shopping centres, as the number of buyers has been particularly affected by the rise in e-commerce.
In general, the wholesale category has become more difficult because buyers are increasingly choosing lower-price retailers such as T.J.Maxx and fast fashion workers such as H&M.
These factors, due to such short-term difficulties as increasingly less international tourist spending and seasonally inadequate weather conditions that Macy's has put in an unstable situation that has been straining for more than a year.
On Thursday, the company announced that its comparable sales volumes in the last quarter had fallen by 2.6 per cent, with a weak improvement, however, taking into account the very bad 6,1 per cent decrease in the annual cut recorded in the previous quarter.
The retailer’s income was 5.87 billion US dollars (7.64 billion Canadian dollars), which was 3.9 per cent less than the previous period.
Macy's said that closing the shops would cost about $1 billion in the US dollar annual turnover.
And so much closure of shops could be considered to be the recognition of the retailer’s collapse.
However, the company’s share value dropped by 17 per cent on Thursday, which shows that investors consider this move to be a proactive measure that announces a stronger future for Macy.
In his opinion, Macy's reducing the number of shops should not be surprising.
The retail director General Terijs Lundgren has already said that the chain is simply too many shops.
The highest-level managers said at some point that they had adopted a new strategy, with a special focus on 150 of its most profitable shops, in an effort to increase sales volumes in the already profitable trading venues.
Jeffs Janete, Director of Macy's, who has been appointed in place of Lundgren since 2017, said in his statement that almost all shops that the company plans to close are those in which sales volumes and profitability are going down.
"We are aware that in these trading venues we still do not receive adequate return on investment and often there is no level of customer shopping experience that reflects our efforts in connection with Macy's brand," said Janet.
The company announced that it would present the list of shops to be closed at a later date.
Macy's said that while still being decided on the closed shops and that is why it is not yet clear how many workers will be fired.
The retailer does not completely deviate from the main markets where he currently has shops, but it is thought of closing the shops that are less active.
This move is unlikely to happen to the shopping mall managers who are counting on large tenants like Macy's to attract and maintain their shopping malls and other smaller shops.
Do you have dangerous bacteria in your water bottle?
According to a new study, drinking from refilled bottles can be "more bad than dropping your dog’s toy", given how many bacteria are going to get in touch.
The website Treadmill Reviews asked EmLab P&K to check 12 four different types of water bottles - with a screwing hook, with a damping hook, with a pressed hook, and with a straw.
Each bottle was used by a sportsman for a week without washing.
Your refillable water bottle may be as dirty as the dog’s toys.
"On the basis of 12 of our verified water bottles, we found that the reusable drinks can contain a worrying number of viable bacteria: more than 300,000 colony-shaped units per square centimeter (CVV/kv.cm.)," says Treadmill Reviews.
Bottles with suspension caps were found to contain a maximum quantity of microbes, more than 900,000 colony-forming units per square centimeter (CVV/kv.cm.)
The bottles contained microbes that may cause skin infections, pneumonia or blood clots.
Bottles with pressed corks were the next worst with 162,000 KVV/vv.cm, while the screws with screws contained only a little less than 160,000 KVV/v.cm.
"Drink water from such bottles may be worse than eating from your pet’s bag," is indicated on the website.
A much better scene is observed in the case of straw bottles where only part of the bacteria in the other bottles were found - only 25 KVV/kv.cm.
This could be because the water is full of up to the lower part of the salmon, not adjacent to its edges, thus attracting moisture-loving microbuses.
The microbes contained in the salmon are described as "mostly safe."
"On the basis of the results of our test, we recommend choosing a bottle with both the salmon and the small number of bacteria and the presence of harmful microbes," said the website.
We also know that when it comes to bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastic.
In addition, water bottles with no leaks and difficult cleaning sites will be less microbial.
On the website, it is recommended to wash the bottles after each use, ideally with a weak bleaching solution.
Religion must be modern or forgotten
In the United States, the Democratic Party recently nominated Hilaria Clinton as its presidential candidate.
If the results of the last polls are indeed the same as the elections, the first president - the woman - will in January innovate in the United States.
Last week, in pairs of the ocean, British Prime Minister Teresa Meja discussed Britain's withdrawal from the European rules with German Chancellor Angel Merkel.
Women raised in Western society have been brought up to know that by means of education, ambition and hard work, they can be competent and successful in any field of professional activity.
And today, new girls can target a number of existing role models in the field of higher leadership.
So, is the fight for equality finally over and over in the long run?
Hillary Clinton is ready at any time to become President of the United States, but the leadership of women in the field of religion remains a controversial issue.
Okay, not completely.
Women's leadership in the religious field remains a controversial issue.
Last week, Pope Francis announced the establishment of a new commission to assess whether women would be involved in a diacon order in the Catholic Church.
The Anglican Church congratulated Libya Lein as the first woman-bishop in January 2015, but it was only after a unsuccessful attempt in 2012.
As long as women are ordained in the Jewish movement in the rabbinic order since the beginning of 1970 and in the conservative movement since the beginning of 1980, the concept of rabbinic in the orthodox Jewish order still has a very strong resistance.
In November 2015, the American Orthodoxal rabbinic Council published a sad news that the concept of female rabbin is contrary to the law, in an attempt to stop the growing wave of support for the proper management of women in rabine.
Not without irony, when Hillary Clinton was appointed as a candidate for the presidency of the Democratic People's Republic, the group of the American leader of the regular rabbin, who opposes women's order, started a series of "debate" on this controversial issue.
Why is there a difference between time and time?
Orthodox Judaism, like most other religions, seeks stability in what it considers to be long-lasting traditional values.
This shows the ability to resist pressure by adapting to a changing society.
Those who oppose women's orders do so on the basis that it is not "traditional."
However, this is how the price is to be taken over with the preservation of traditions.
And such a unilateral thought price can paradoxly affect the tradition of itself by removing the traditional community oxygen that it needs to maintain life.
In the book "August firearms", in World War I military history, Barbara Taczmena stresses the danger of giving priority to the tradition of what has become known as "the tragedy of the red bull."
By the beginning of World War I, war had taken its way from the close of battle to the heavier artillery that is spread from the distance, and it became beneficial to hide the warriors as long as possible.
The British and German armies responded to these changes by replacing their bright uniforms with long-lasting greys and browns.
However, the French soldiers still wore the same red hats and trousers that made them easy to reach.
The proposal by French War Minister Ádolf Mesimi that the armies under his command could act in a similar manner was perceived as a mockery and opposition.
The red shirts reflected the military's pride and prestige, and the military traditionalists were not ready to give it up.
Speaking in parliament, former Minister of War Eigen Etjén spoke on behalf of France.
"Refuse the red pants?" he exclaimed.
Sometimes!
"There was an inexplicable and idiotic annex to the most visible of all colors," he later wrote in Messim, "there had to be bad consequences."
Leaders of faith who are fighting for the inclusion of women in the leading religious roles could join the same ranks.
By focusing only on "traditional" religion, rather than asking the important question: "What changes are needed to make religion go up?" they risk losing about 50 percent of their followers.
They also deprive the whole community of talent, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise provide.
Assembling that men continue to wear bikes when it comes to religion can be traditional, but as the funeral of the red bikes shows, it may not be worth it.
Dina Breivere is the founder of JOFA (Women's Orthodox Feminist Association) in Great Britain and an orthodox rabbinic student in Jeshivat Maharat in New York.
The children of the municipality of Rojas gained new skills in the camp.
From 1 to 6 August, Rojupe's children and young people took place in the centre of the "Varawiknes Bridges" camp, during which participants creatively manifested, sported and gained new skills.
On the closing day of the convention, the children were very interested in gleaming glass jars.
Younger Māra Folkmane, a specialist at the Rojupe Children and Young People's Initiative Centre, said that this was one of the activities that the participants enjoyed most.
It was also a great pleasure to visit the "Mazbebriņi" table of Einar Mountain.
Most children liked lasergravier because it was possible to see the picture on the computer being gradually placed on the child.
E. Kalniņš has told us what subjects should be taught in school if he wants to work at the table, that is, the main thing is mathematics, in particular geometry, computer science, as well as technical drawing and drawing.
He also stressed the need to work more with brains than with muscles in this profession.
In a small shop there are individual orders, and it is important to plan everything first.
To get to know others better, at the start of the camp, participants participated in various games, as well as jointly formed camps "gerbons".
On Wednesday, passing along the sea from Paradise to Zocene, natural materials were collected that were later used to make maps.
Sports games were also desired, which are of particular importance to participants.
We went to multi-dwelling houses where we had a sports and recreation field, played football and a network ball.
Children like sports activities, we have lots of kids playing football, basketball, and every time they demand something sportsy.
Girls enjoy more peaceful jobs.
On the next day, with the help of self-contained mass, decorative burskins, which can be used later as seal holders.
It was also a talent evening, and the children chose to play together, and one evening they were dedicated to the front.
Table games were also played, each one could show his or her knowledge at the time of the photo orientation, where objects had to be found and photographed after the posters.
The task was to meet differently in each picture.
We also dyed almonds - some like it more, some less.
There will never be one role that will be enjoyed by all - one that is closer to sport, another that creates.
"Now it seems that everyone is doing an interesting job of glazing the glass," said Mr. Folkman.
In conclusion, diplomas were issued on creativity, sport and assistance - several children helped directly in economic work.
The name "Varawiksne bridge" has been created because children from three associations - Rojupes and Melnsil's Children and Youth Initiative Centre, as well as the multifunctional centre of Rojas municipality "Strops".
They're such a conciliatory bridge.
If parents think something faster, we take ideas; if they do, they take from us.
We share experience.
This year, 30 participants were involved in the camp - children who were active during the year.
"We had planned that there would be 30, and it also met," says Mr. Folkman.
It's been a five-year-old.
It began in 2010 when the Social Service of the Municipality of Rojas decided that a camp should be organised in summer for multi-child families and for children with disabilities.
However, the situation has improved in Rio since then, and the camp is now designed for the inhabitants of the municipality, who come and work in youth centres.
The goal is to spend a lot of time and time on it.
Two camps had taken place before, and 20 children attended each, and only one camp was held in the country as a whole.
Similar activities take place over the past year.
The children painted, painted glass, came to the villages of Einars Kalniņš, who taught the burning of wood, the making of machines from wood, with figurines in various forms.
There's also a new technique - encaustics, it's coloring with hot wax cream.
The teacher Ilze Shelkova led the formation of polymer material, and we made balloons and various puzzles.
We make paintings of natural materials, interesting mandala from bees, bees, linseeds, autumn leaves.
We're trying to use what's around us.
The youth centre works from 3 to 2 p.m. in the winter, and in the summer, from 2 p.m. to 2 p.m.
"In Rudje, 15 children visit the youth centre on average," said Mr. Folkmane.
She stresses that great support is provided by the council of the municipality of Rojas, which understands the need to give money to children because they form our future.
Charlton Athletic fans "can only take a season ticket if they sign a behavioural contract" and agree not to criticise the club's social media.
While we recognize that everyone has the right to his own personal opinion, the publication of pulsating comments on such websites is not beneficial.
In the field of administration, a fan was then told that he would have to receive a ticket personally from former senior police inspector Clifa Iger, who joined the club last month after 35 years of career police force.
In the following letters: "I must inform you that the award of the seasonal ticket will be renewed on the condition that you sign "A concerted behavioural contract" (ABC), which will provide that you will continue to refrain from publishing negative or mussifying comments about clubs or club representatives on all kinds of social media websites, or any other behaviour that might be considered antisocial."
Speaking to Daily Telegraph, the fans described how he called the club after the season ticket fee, which was not received either, and two days later a letter was received by mail.
Yesterday he went to a meeting at the club and said, "They told me that I was too much "twisted" by telling others who are funny."
Rising holidays on the coasts of Dalmatia
What do you mean, "freaky"?
I am going here from all power," said Colina, former U.S. Marine Commander, who had just taken off a 25-year-old ride along some uneven central part of the Croatian island, leaving nothing there, except the spooky expression of sweat and wounds of loose sailors scattered in hostile mountains.
Some riders sing hymns or number of children’s dolls to make it easier for them to be on the mountain.
Colin's friend Petia recommends "The Little Engine That Could".
Others may be in silence, thinking about what it takes to get to a trance similar to what is spoken of by angry riders.
Kolina's getting a little bit thinter than a lot of it.
Driving a few gardens for her in front is like living behind Hugh Greens as a movie at the beginning of "The Four Weddings and One Bears".
She and my mission are a week-long "luxury" yacht and cycling along the coast and islands of the North Dalmatian Croatia organized by Freedom Treks.
The ride in summer heat at a mountain spot such as Croatia may not be consistent with every sense of horror, but it says that the North Dalmatian is easier to get out than the South Dalmatian, our decks are soft, and when we filled in the booking forms, freely and convincingly before all those months, there was a window that we did not notice that could have provided us with the battery with a charged e-velosiped.
The part of the deal's luxury is our floating house for a week, the brand new Melody.
At the end of the trip, we can beat our bikes in battle at our guides Ivan and Ivan and the ship's back to the blue water, without contacting sea lions, ash stones and other people on the narrow stone strips that the Croatians call the beach.
In June the water temperature in the sea is perfect, everyone agrees: it will be cold enough to cool, but not cold.
On Melody there are masks and breathing tubes and some kayaks, if someone feels energetic after a heavy morning on the shores.
Instead, most of us return to our cabins with air conditioners, where Helen, the ship's massier - I'm not joking - will have already put on our beds, added our minibary stocks and left a new box with chocolates on the table.
Ivan says that walking after a ride is very important, and we learn to walk on our beds or with the sunglasses present on the upper deck together with the bartender Antonio, who is always ready to prepare one of his cocktails.
"Melody", 42 m long with 15 cabins and semi-duty crews, not a issued super-jacket, but a stylish little cruise ship.
It turns towards a small island port between fishing vessels and fleet holiday yachts, and we are proud to belong to it.
Colina and Petija belong to a group of friends from Washington, Colombia: sports and public activists after 45, as they call themselves.
Last year’s grandiose and bicycle holidays in the Netherlands were so successful that they decided to try something more richer for their experiences, so they are in Croatia.
The competing chapel from their church is on the ferry and bicycle holidays in Provans, and every afternoon the air connects the competing Facebook publication pingpong rally.
The element of holiday experiences can be overlooked because our schedule is nothing unless a specific regime is established.
"Broast and dinner are in eight," Ivan told the new participants at the opening meeting when we started our way from the beautiful old Trogir port, near Split.
One ship’s call indicates that the buffet is open, while the other at the end of the meal calls for a quiet and careful listening to the further information.
"Good!" is the cultural context which may have been lost everywhere, but not in the British contingent.
What a difference - the sensitivity has already taken the turn, the jokes seem like an overcrowding race, while Ivana issues a day's tour card, but we all seem to be afraid of the snorkeling, the exploding and the profile of the contours and the fall, even though any other would be a surprise on the Croatian road that starts and ends at sea level.
"It's like a heart monitor," said Ivan.
The full balance is not recommended.
Ivan conducts the information meeting in parallel by freely switching from English to German.
There are weeks when he has to deal with a dozen different peoples, but we are a simple group - Swiss, German, American and British, who sit easily at the tables where two speak English, but one at a time.
On the way, we're all friends.
Driving promotes the public, and only competition is within itself, respectively.
I do not recall when the dynamics of the group would have been more harmonious and more relaxed.
We're about to head for Ivan's wave.
A small increase is a slope that should not be mixed with inequality, which is a good thing.
Matadas are serpentines and straight forward means straight: simple but not always easy.
The driving instructions are always the same: "Go one by one, delay the distance, and they are not a competition.
Stay on the coast of nine.
All right, five pairs - I'll remember you're on vacation.
Take plenty of water.
From Trogira we will take a two-day cruise north through the Kornati archipelago, where we will go almost all along Dugi Otok - in the Croatian language "garo island" - and after a small break we will take a walk through the natural park of Telašcica, amazed by its cliffs and salt lakes, where the sea is flowing through the underground channel.
It says that those who earn it are getting younger because of its power.
If we do, will our legs feel younger and stronger?
In the small island of Molata, we return to the south, moving from the continent to the nearby islands apparently by chance.
Most of our journey is on empty small roads outside the country with wide views of the sea and a variety of plants: olive groves, wine gardens, ace plants brigades, Mediterranean fresh air and countless taverns in flight.
We go forward, there's always a moment, but then when Ivan lets you stop, there's always a big shadow, and the little balls are like a prize to those who have arrived faster.
Sports and public activists go a lot on the weekends, and they know the rules of conduct by sending warnings in a row and leaving free places so that motorists can perform the firing maneuvers much more safely.
"You're almost done," one wheelman said to the other after the heavy car driver decided to take the ignition manoeuvre on an invisible curve and quickly stopped.
Fortunately, the brakes worked.
Ivan divides us into three groups each on short journeys on the main roads, with Ivan himself in the back to ensure and "give the tempo", as Ivan says.
If we have to cross the main road, we all meet, get off the bikes and get on the road with our bicycles on the other side as instructed, not before.
"Do you think Ivan knows he's not talking to a group of kids?" asks the Swiss wheelman when we stand by the road and wait for a signal when we can cross it.
Not all afternoons can be spent on vacation.
In the city view of Zadar, the Roman forum and the sea eagles are open, playing music that tastes like the danger of the sea, through the tunnels in stone in the promenade and open water.
Zadar's famous sunflower perfectly intertwined between the main day and the pudding, and after dark entry we return to the sea shores and see the wave-operated lights in the glass sidewalk, which is actually a dance floor.
When "Melody" early in the morning starts the way to the giant Biograd resort, the song of the eagles is nothing more than a smell.
On the fifth day, we are completely free from driving.
The trip up the river Krka to view its watercourses; then the afternoon tour in Sibenik, where we look at the thought cathedral, the masterpiece of Dalmatian Renaissance, as well as the steps of the chair on the peaceful Zlarina Island, looking for its local precious coral, makes this day interesting.
Lurda's ready to take the St. John's in the shadow of the attack.
During the annual Catholic celebration, people gather at the temple of the Lord.
The French security forces are on high alert, as thousands of Catholics gather at the annual celebration of the Lord’s Church in the shadow of several terrorist acts.
Each year on August 15, thousands of people gather at the Mount of Piraeus, returning to the Festival of Booths to mark the reception of the young Mary in heaven.
This year’s celebration takes place at a time when Catholics have been shocked by the killing of an older French priest on July 26, by two Islamic extremists who attacked the church in northern France during the mission and turned over his weapon.
Jacques Amela's blindfolding took place two weeks after a Tunisian -- the investigators claim that he was radicalized by the online video of the jihadist -- was inflated by a truck in the Bastille Day party in the city of Nija, killing 85 people.
After three large attacks over 18 months, many French people are cautious about public intervention.
The number of tourists declined dramatically, and the authorities argued that the number of visitors this year could fall quickly.
However, fear of mass reactions did not materialize -- and some organizers say that even the influx of visitors' applications has been observed recently.
Approximately 25,000 faithful arrivals are expected, including large groups from Italy and Belgium and about 200 members of the East Branch of Christianity - the delegation of correct representatives.
Many pilgrims have announced that they have not allowed themselves to be stumbled.
"We do not intend to stop living," 66-year-old visitor Christian said to the agency AFP, describing prayer as the "one weapon" in the fight against violence.
"It is important to show that life will continue," said Matje Guinars - one of the coordinators.
We will not give up our faith, our beliefs, and our way of life simply because some fanatics are trying to sow fear.
As a result of the concerns about the security in France since the attack in Nice, a number of large measures have been lifted, including the huge pitfalls in the northern city of Lillie and the European Championship on Wagon, which was due to take place in Nice in September.
"Last week I lived in fear that my phone would call in one call to cancel applications," said Fabjen in Legjesne last week, a priest responsible for official pilgrimages.
"Just the opposite - it seems that the attacks have mobilized the believers," he said and announced the influx of last minute's applications.
The head of the trade union of local hotel workers, Christian Zhel, confirmed the "high interest" of the holiday after the attacks.
In 1858, the site where the young woman Mary appeared in the cave to poor shepherd Bernadette Subirū was severely restricted.
About 250 police officers and two dozen soldiers have been deployed to protect the site, including bomb neutralisation experts and experts with explosives search dogs.
In addition, the number of access points was reduced from twelve to three at the entrance crossing of the safety barriers.
Katrina Simkoksa, who traveled from northeastern England to Lurdu at the beginning of this month, described enhanced security measures.
"By the morning of Thursday morning there were armed guards in the temples, and then through the gates (with metal barriers) could only go through one, and the sums were searched," she said The Local.
"This all upset my three children who have gone to Lurda, and it was hard for them not to curse them when they asked why it is happening," she said.
It didn’t hurt my impressions, but it made me sad that it was necessary, and I realized that many people were calming down.
The process of opening Friday is also shortened - instead of starting in the city of Lurda and moving further to the temple, it will start and end in the temple.
Other measures include the closure of the airspace for flights above Lurda, the closure of the streets near the traffic station and the replacement of the waste urea against transparent plastic bags.
French Interior Minister Bernard Kazeneev will examine security measures on Saturday.
About six million people go to Lurdu each year, making it one of the largest Catholic destinations in the world.
Many visitors accompany relatives who are sick or with disabilities and who come to swim in the well where Bernadette has seen Mary in the water medical properties.
There Castio, one of the organizers, described this year's meeting as "a bit unusual", taking into account "the threat as root seems to be being sought in France."
However, he claimed that this would not affect the quality and depth of their experiences.
Frenchman 58-year-old volunteer who helped the sick Saints admitted that, in her opinion, the presence of soldiers dressed in civilian fashion was "a bit embarrassing."
However, if it all calms down, it's good.

The discovery of the season for aquatic birds is imminent.
Each year, on the second Saturday of August, the season for aquatic birds is opened.
This year it will begin at 16:00 p.m. on 13 August, so the State police call on both hunters and citizens to be particularly careful and to comply with security rules.
Water bird hunting takes place not only in hunting areas but also in public watercourses, and although weather conditions do not vary from year to year, it is also permitted to be used by vacationers along with hunters.
Both the fishermen and the restorants and those living at the water stations are invited to be particularly careful in the vicinity of the lakes and rivers and to comply with safety rules, without endangering themselves or others.
As it has been observed in previous years that a large number of hunters are involved in the first days of the opening of the season, this year, in cooperation with the State Forest Service, will also be able to strengthen the control of the game.
During the control, law enforcement will focus on the compliance of arms and ammunition with legal standards and will monitor the conduct of hunting without the effects of alcoholic beverages and aprivileged substances.
The police recall that aquatic birds are prohibited from using semi-automatic firearms with a total capacity of more than three cartridges, including the amendment of the Arms and Special Means Act, in particular section 22 (91), which states that persons with high-speed firearms or high-energy pneumatic weapons registered for hunting or sport, and during the short stop of two hours when these weapons are transported to or from hunting, have the right to keep arms and ammunition in the vehicle during hunting, but they must be placed as safely as possible, in order to ensure that the furthel or other packaging in which the ammunition or weapons are put in place, do not show off the road from the roadway, to the roadside, to the roadblocks, to the roadblocks and to the roadblocks.
The police call to take care of their own and fellow humans' safety during the season and, if you consider violations of law or any threat to security, call the telephone 110 immediately.
In any event, the legislators shall be prepared to respond to the information provided by the citizens.
New Caledonian coast satricin 7.2 magnitude earthquake
New Caledonian coasts destroyed 7.2 magnitude earthquake on Friday, reported seismology, indicating that there was no tsunami threat.
The epicenter of the Earthquake was located nine kilometers deep 109 kilometers east of New Caledonia at 1.26 p.m. after Green Time (see 4.26 p.m. in Latvia), the U.S. Geology Research Centre announced.
In the Pacific, the Cunami anxiety centre indicated that there is currently no warning or recommendation regarding possible tsunami threats to the region.
"The Earthquakes in this region, as it is known, are not undetected, nor have they been found lately," said the senior seismologist Fils Kamins, research center of Geoscience Australia.
Potentially, it could be felt in Vanuatu or New Caledonian islands, but I doubt it is so powerful to do the bidding.
New Caledonia is located in the "Fire Circle" - in the Pacific Teketonic Activity Zone, where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur frequently.
Colombia and Venezuela agree on the opening of the border.
Colombia and Venezuela agreed to open the checkpoints at the borders of both countries, which were closed on Thursday at the Venezuelan initiative, told the Presidents of Colombia and Venezuela Juan Manuel Santos and Nikolas Maduro.
The initial border points will only be open to the passengers.
Starting on Saturday, five border points will be opened every day from 8:00 to 20:00.
It will be possible to open the border to transport once individual cross-border agreements on security, trade and energy have been concluded, the President said.
Maduro was forced to close the border in August in response to the attack by the Colombian soldiers on the Venezuelan border patrol.
Three Venezuelan soldiers were injured in the attack.
In July this year, the Venezuelan unilaterally opened the border twice because of the economic crisis in the axis - the Venetians who came to poverty tried to break through the border to buy the first necessary items in the border shops.
This was used by 200,000 Venezuelan citizens.

Facebook applies to anti-fighting advertising blockers.
The most widely used social network in the world Facebook has voiced a warning like a shooter, making it clear that blocking advertising banners using special tools is not acceptable and that users will also have to watch advertising.
The popularity of special advertising blockers is increasing, but this means that companies whose main source of income is directly advertising are falling.
Facebook has now made it known that it is well understood the harmful nature of advertising banners, but users will also have to live with them.
The truth is, they will be provided with tools to choose for themselves what kind of material they are shown, the BBC reports.
"As we provide people with more and more control options, we will also start to show advertising to those who use advertising blocking software," said Facebook commercial vice president Andrew Boswarts.
In other words, users will be able to choose what type of advertising they see by selecting brands and sectors that they think are interesting.
"People don't like to see advertisements that don't apply to them or interfere with the enjoyment of content," Boswart said.
Advertising blocking tools in mobile devices usually do not work, from which Facebook receives a larger visit, but the reduction of its banner exposure is also measured in billions of terms of money.
According to BBC information, advertising blockers are used by approximately 200 million people.
It has already been reported that in the previous quarter of the business Facebook revenue from the advertising was 6.2 billion US dollars or 5.55 billion euros.
It should be said that this is not the first time Facebook is actively involved in determining what network users see in their youth flows.
As one of the last steps, Facebook has just begun to act to remove from the new flows or at least limit the headlines that actually hide the "empty" news.
Asphalt work will be carried out on the streets of Freedom at night; traffic restrictions must be calculated.
Today, asphalt insertion works will take place from the Bérzaune Street to Gustav Zemgal Street, so drivers will have to calculate limited traffic at this stage.
As the agency LETA learned in Riga, traffic restrictions will begin at this stage from 21 a.m. tonight and asphalt work will last until 12 a.m..7.
Traffic towards the South will be routed through tram tracks.
Drivers must calculate limited traffic at this stage and the additional time spent on the road.
The municipality calls for an understanding of how to deal with the restrictions imposed and to comply with the rules of the traffic organisation.
The refurbishment of the roof began in the capital's highways - the freeway from the Raynas boulevard to the Láchpläs street and from the air bridge to the Juglas street, the Láchläs street from the Salt Bridge to the Avota street, the Juglas street from the Kvelles to the Malian street and the Grandevards street from the Railway to the 84th school.
Constructions last until the beginning of the new year of training, and are organised continuously, even at night, when mainly asphalt is included.
Medvedev's deputy in Riga will trust several ZZS ministers.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitrija Medvedeva Deputy Arkadijs Dvorkovics last week, visiting Riga, secretly engaged with three Green and Agriculture Union (ZZS) ministers in a fish processing plant.
The informal meeting took place at the fish processing plant "Kaija", attended by Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola, Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis and Minister of Agriculture Janis Düłlavs, post internet portal "see.lv".
The fact that such a meeting took place confirmed the portal Reizniece-Ozola.
She explained that the meeting was about the abolition of sanctions for fish processors, as well as the Inčukalna gas storage.
Meetings against diplomatic practice have taken place without the involvement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The organizer of the meeting was Russian Ambassador Alexander Vešnjakov.
More than €130 000 is suspected to be committed by the accounting officer.
This month, the National Police (VP) Anti-Economic Crimes Administration (ENAP) informed the agency of the VP representative, Gjibovska, of the 130,000 involvement of a bookstore held by a Riga commercial company that had been working in the company for 20 years.
The current information shows that a woman suspected of having committed illegal activities for several years and that she has suffered a total loss of more than 130 thousand euros.
Given that the company’s officials did not closely follow the cash flow and rely on their employees, they learned about the current machinery only after several years.
VP ENAP policemen this month detained the suspect women born in 1963 and in the company were being harassed.
In the context of the incident, criminal proceedings have been initiated on the basis of a large extent of arrest.
The law provides for the deprivation of liberty for up to ten years by confiscation of property or without confiscation of property.
The detained person is currently subject to a security measure that is not related to the withdrawal of liberty.
In Estonia, the Zika virus antibodies were discovered in nine people.
In Estonia, nine people will be analysed with Zika virus antibodies, which means that they may have been in contact with this infection, the Estonian Public Radio Organisation ERR.
The laboratory's information indicates that Zika's virus tests were conducted this year for 121 samples and nine of them were positive.
The first cases of Zika have been identified from Estonia in the neighbouring countries of Finland and Sweden.
Estonia’s health management data indicate that no acute cases of Zika’s virus infection have been recorded in the country and that in cases of flu-like symptoms, people do not have to perform Zika’s virus test, but they should turn to their family doctor.
We have found IgG (Immunoglobulin G class) antibodies that show that at some point the subject is infected with Zika or similar virus.
"This does not mean that the patient is infected with Zika's virus," explained the head of the laboratory's synlab infection department, Paul Nábers.

In Latvia there is a problem with the development of quality car purchases, BNS told Auto Association Vice-President Ingus Rūtuņš in an interview with the agency.
Rūts replied in a positive manner, whether it was in the car sector or in the car sector that there were problems with dumped prices.
Of course.
The purchases of cars are different from the purchases of service services in which handling at prices is easier.
The end result of the car must be paid in any event, since it must be purchased from the manufacturer.
However, the problem is and can be classified in two groups.
Whether the contracting authority is incompetent or unable to establish a quality procurement, as a result, it is often unaware of the "purchase".
"Or a very well-known purchase is built to get something specific, and then there are all such wonders," said the Vice President of the Auto Association.
He pointed out that it is now popular to talk about moving away from the lowest price offer to the most economically profitable offer as a criterion for determining the buyer, but in part the public still has a false idea about these things.
Now it's very popular - let's go from the lowest price to the most economically profitable offer!
However, the criteria must be set in both cases and, when taken into account and evaluated, the decision shall be taken at the same time as the lowest price.
The technical criteria for quality procurement should be very precise and market-friendly.
On the other hand, there is no point in assessing what can be expressed in a monetary expression.
Points do not require the assessment of fuel consumption, emissions, service services and similar matters.
It is the expected life cycle of the car, the journey, etc., and it can also be calculated as a whole.
"The question then is only where the customer is interested in the scenarios?" explains Rutuņš.
On the other hand, the director of the Auto Association projects, Peter Rubulis, noted that the problems are linked to the fact that often the same person creates purchases for cars, workplaces, food and these purchases are derived from one sample.
We have also brought to our attention the spare parts of the procurement sample, which was difficult to name rather than a detailed absurdity.
"The problem is that the buyer is very often lacking any understanding of the subject matter and the requirements are simply copied from somewhere," Rubulis acknowledged.
Rutuņš added, on the other hand, that less is the structure that announces the purchase, because there may be more problems.
"It is obvious that this is precisely because there is a lack of human resources and competences," said the vice-president of the associations.
Latvian volleyballists do not fight for medals.
Latvian beach volleyball duets Aleksandrs Samoilovs and Jānis Šmēdīņš went out of the Rio Olympics tournament on Thursday, deciding to join the host of Evandra Gonsalveš Oliveira and Pedro Solberg Salgad in the match.
Our duet was only one win in three matches, and in the D subgroup, it came in the last fourth place.
It has caused quite a stir and sadness in social networks, so we offer to look at the brightest records of Twitter.
Celebrations of Riga began with a trade.
Take a look at the picture of the holiday trade in Esplanade.
"Die Reply" accuses the "Sacrifice Unit" of swallowing style.
On Thursday, the South African group "Die Reply" accused Suicid Sqaud of using the film as a "self-killing unit" for using the group's unique look without permission, calling the respected director "small-fed food".
The group's lead singer Jolandi on the mobile app "Instagram" turned to the film director "Warner Bros", saying, "Just like that, David Ajer, you're making our style."
As she claims, the film stars of the War Delavines and Jared Leto have told you that Ajers was you in the film field "Die Reply".
"But you didn't ask permission to hug us," said the singer.
The 31-year-old musician claims that her group member Ninja (Ninja) would briefly turn to Ajera in this matter, but he "did not answer anything like such a little bit of food".
Jolandi argues that Ajers has taken over the scenes since 2011 of the short film "Umshini Wam" introducing the South African hippop duo.
She also published a video showing that Ajers Joker and Harley Queen have lost sight of both singers.
Leto himself insists that the inspiration of Joker's image is based on the image of the handicraft David Bowie.
In conclusion, Jolandi has voted in favour of the highly critical assessment of the film's performance.
Jolandi and Ninja, in the real words of Anri du Tuata and Vatican Tudors Jones, won the fame with three rapa studio records, popularizing the African 'Zef' counterculture.
Today's most brilliant gypsies and jazz guitarist ensemble "The Rosenberg Trio" (Netherlands) will be the first time in Latvia to hear the festival "Summertime" this evening, August 12.

Turkey is looking for missing diplomats after the turnout attempt
Turkey is looking for at least 32 diplomats who did not return after the attempt to turn 15 July with the withdrawn staff.
Foreign Minister Mevits Chavusoglis said Friday that from around the world to the time of the conversion attempt to Ankara, 208 Turkish ministers were withdrawn, and 32 have lost "without permission".
Approximately 18,000 civilians, military leaders and academics have been arrested or withdrawn from their duties in Turkey, viewing them as loyal US official Fetul Gulen, charged with the development of the government's supply plan.
Gullen, who lives in Pennsylvania, is one of Turkey's most sought after people.
Kavosoglu said that the US Department of Justice team will visit Turkey this month to discuss its possible issue.
This issue has become a problem for the US in relations with Turkey, NATO Member State.
The United States opposed Turkey's President Recep Tayyyip Erdogan's strong weaponry tactics after turning, and Turkey responded to it in an effort to establish closer links with Russia.
Kavosoglu said that Turkish military attachés in Greece have fled to Italy, the attaché in Kuwait tried to flee to Saudi Arabia, but was sent back, and two Generals from Afghanistan were detained in Dubai and sent to Turkey.
He also said that two Bangladeshi officials fled to New York, and one of the Russians went to Japan.
The Ankara newspaper Daily Hurryet, quoting military sources, reported that Turkey's military attaché has also been lost in Jordan.
The Wall Street Journal, quoting an official of the United States who is aware of this situation, reported that Turkey's military commander, based in Virginia, has requested asylum in the NATO command centre.
There are those who have managed to escape.
There have also been refugees amongst our diplomats," Kavosoglu said in an interview to the broadcaster NTV.
Since yesterday, the time has expired for those who were originally called back.
We will take legal action against those who have not returned.
The organizers of the Olympics try to clear the green-colored diving pool
The Olympic kidneys, which were scheduled for a practice Friday, arrived at the closed pool because the organizers needed more time to clean green water before the first individual competitions in the Olympics.
The water suddenly changed color on Tuesday, in the midst of a synchronized diving contest.
The organizers claimed that the water competitions were safe even after the larger pool next to the water pool and the synchronized swimming were also light green.
Nursing was not yet possible when athletes arrived at the morning heating, although the pool was finally opened at 13.00 a.m. local time - only 2 1/2 hours before women’s 3 meters competition.
The water color looked closer to its normal color, but still with a green color.
An American kidney named Ebie Johnson, who is struggling with a trampline, told me that she had come to the heat just to find out that the pool was closed without warning.
She wrote in her tweet that "#FixTheSwamp (save the purvu) should be fashion.
British kidneyman Tom Deilijs, who praised the bronze in the synergizing of the platform, also commented on the status of the pool in the tweeter's record.
Hopefully, this means that in the last days, we are not as bad as we are!
Mario Andrada, the chief speaker of the local organizers’ committee, stressed that the pool is safe for competitions by giving green light for 3 metres.
He agreed that some sportsmen had trouble water, but he said it was the result of the pool’s cleaning efforts.
"We repeat repeatedly what we have said all the time - water does not in any way endanger sportsmen's health," he said.
On the first day of such watering, one or two athletes complained that they were not looking.
It was the result that the first reaction, when we saw the water becoming green, was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - that is used very often in swimming pools.
We immediately reduced the quantity.
We checked the water again, and it fully responded to the parameters.
Simon Langford, head of the Polish Water Sports Centre, said that the pool was closed for additional cleaning work.
He said that he supported the decision by the world’s leading organisation FINA (International Swimming Federation).
"The reason is that the water needs to be calm so that the pool can get back to its blue color as soon as possible," Langford said in his statement.
Andrada said that the deterioration of the state of the pool had surprised the unplanned organizers.
"The chemistry is not accurate science," he said.
Some things you can see take a while.
In the last few days, the formation of water color in the normal condition has made it even more difficult.
"It's no use," Andrad said.
He added that the sportsmen of the morning had access to dry training, but admitted that it was "not ideal."
He explained that the change in the colour of the basin was elevated due to alkaline levels, like aquarium water may become green if not adequately monitored.
When we started doing something to prevent greens, there were discussions about the best chemicals.
We cannot use too much chemicals in water because sportsmen are training in it," Andrada said.
We could certainly have done better at first so as not to allow the water to become green.
When it became green, we made a mistake again.
AP sports viewers J. Cohen and Steve Types Riodezaneiro participated in the development of this topic.
Shanghai, Taipei, despite the suspension of cross-border communication
However, Shanghai and Taipei will hold an annual city forum in Taipei from 22 to 23 August, the municipality of Shanghai announced Friday despite the suspension of cross-border communication mechanisms.
This High-level Municipal Officer, Mr. Hailins Shanghai, will lead the delegation represented in the forum, announced by the Government of Shanghai on its official microblog account, Sina Weibo.
The Forum has been taking place in the order of rotation of both cities since 2010.
The 2016 Forum will focus on the exchange of experiences in areas such as health care, electronic administrative services, culture and transport, seeking to "enhance the exchange of experience and cooperation in various aspects" between the two cities, as reported by the Shanghai Government.
The Taiwanese side has not recognised the agreement reached in 1992, which strengthened the single Chinese principle since the new leader Tsai Ing-vens took office in May, as a result of which communication and consultation mechanisms have been suspended.
On Friday, Mr. Ksiaoguang , a spokesman of the National Council for Foreign Affairs, said that peaceful cross-border relations can exist while the Taiwanese side adheres to the 1992 agreement's political foundations.
"We have an active and open attitude towards the exchange of experience between the two sides of the city," said MA, stressing that the essence of cross-border relations and the exchange of experience of the city should be interpreted correctly.
The Ugandan President meets with Chinese Foreign Minister, hopes for closer cooperation
On Thursday, meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Vangu Ji, Uganda's President Joveri Musveni thanked China for its long-term support for Uganda's development and expressed hope for closer cooperation.
Museveni said that China is a sense of Uganda and Africa's friend who supported the liberation of the African continent from colonialism and later supported Africa's economic and social development.
The President mentioned Tanzania - Zambia's construction of the railway in the 1970s as evidence of support in Chinese Danish, even when China itself had not been particularly fed.
Museveni said that China had implemented multilateral cooperation with Uganda, by investing both in infrastructure and in business and in cultural exchange, and added that such cooperation contributes to the long-term development of Uganda more than simply financial assistance.
He hopes that China will be able to participate in various ways in the development of Uganda's infrastructure and the construction of industrial parks.
He also invites the Chinese to invest more in Uganda and travel it.
Wang She praised Uganda's activities in the areas of industrialization and agricultural modernisation and added that China will continue to be the most reliable and ideal partner for Uganda's cooperation.
Wangs announced that China is ready to do everything possible to help Uganda's economic and social development, and added that China and Uganda's cooperation is true and without any political considerations, because it is based on high level political credibility and time- tested friendship.
He said that China could strengthen cooperation with Uganda's infrastructure and industrial parks, as well as support the development of the energy and agriculture sectors of this Eastern African people.
