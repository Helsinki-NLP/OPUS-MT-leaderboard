A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to fight the electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center holds the latter for a myth, confirming that the election fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by the lightning strike.
In the United States, only 300 cases of election fraud have been reported by the Republican lawyers in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on election participation.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermined by the United States' democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for holding elections in individual countries.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have announced new laws since 2009 that make registration or time-consuming.
After the November 2010 elections, 675 new Republican representatives could be listed in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 legislative drafts were introduced in 2011 alone, limiting the exercise of electoral law in 41 countries.
The new electoral laws require voters to provide a photo and evidence of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the time limits for the preliminary vote, invalidate the right to register as electors on the election day, and give citizens the right to vote for which they have a legal act.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state asked the electorate to present a photo of light.
Indiana was the first state to raise such a claim.
In 2008, the United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Act.
The Republican authorities agreed to extend this practice to other countries.
During the last two years, they have promoted legislation in 34 federal states, forcing voters to display a photo of light.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, the US citizens do not have a universal insurance card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of the US citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible persons, do not have a photocopy issued by a government authority of their country.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a statement.
However, there are often more than a hundred dollars to be paid to obtain the required evidence.
Young people, minorities and low-income people are severely affected by the new restrictions.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with income less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the necessary photo display.
That's still enough.
Students who are considered to be voters who increase their vote for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photocopies issued by their institution in several countries.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of fishing or hunting associations who choose more strongly for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship for election.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their citizenship in the US.
These measures clearly aim at limiting the Spanish votes.
Because it is up to two of the three Spanish voters to prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators in 2011 have promoted legislation in eight federal states that abolished the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide support to those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaign for electoral registration in the 2004 general elections has contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of the 2010 registration of new voters by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other federal states aimed at shortening the period for the preliminary vote.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who chose in advance were African-Americans, although they accounted for only 13% of the country's voters.
The same applies to the Spanish population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who chose in advance.
In contrast, the whites representing 76% of the voters accounted for only 46% of the voters who chose in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several legislative drafts were blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 federal states have passed laws requiring the demonstration of a visual evidence.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote.
The democratic critics are intimidating the party-political nature of the adopted laws and, as a clear objective, view the impact of the results in the countries that will be successful for 2012.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Center shows that those States that have adopted these laws make 171 of the 270 votes required in the Elections Committee to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the rules of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on election participation.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermined by the United States' democratic system.
Early detection of prostate cancer: should the test be performed or not?
The PSA test shows, in fact, sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to stronger delays in the already undecided men for the implementation of early detection tests.
Whether to play a sound to notify of events.
We've got the opinion of two doctors.
In the U.S. studies, there were numerous interference factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without prior recognition.
This study also showed that in a 12-year follow-up study, the probability of metastases was higher by 30 to 40% if no prior recognition was performed.
That is why I recommend the test from 50 years of age or 40 if you have a direct relative who has already been diagnosed with prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk for men of African-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer has been detected.
There are cancer species that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
Patients need to be made aware of the risk of their cancer by showing them the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is more likely that they will be able to actively monitor the disease.
Today, many men with cancer are not treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are offered active surveillance and are offered treatment in the course of disease progression.
The criteria for a decision that should be dealt with and which should not be dealt with are increasingly determined.
That's why I still recommend conducting the test.
Most important, however, it is to talk to his doctor to determine whether he should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the international company for Urology, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of sickness.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eat well and move sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson of Canadian cancer society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unclear.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It's seriously damaging people's health.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," laments the speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after giving up the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and adipositions also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, gut, stomach, digestive, abdominal and cervical cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity protects against crimson cancer throughout life," he adds.
The diet
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too much it increases the risk of becoming ill with a crimson or stomach cancer.
Roots should also be delivered.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salt can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamin
In recent years, several scientists have examined the relationship between vitamins and cancers.
However, your investigations are currently not final.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on Vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study revealed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family load.
"The conduct of an ex-recognition test does not lead to cancer."
Analysis of the Higgs Boson
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs Boson has gained some insight in the last summer, and this is for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is nothing less involved than the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle, whose existence from the standard model - our best or "at least false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - predicted, but empirically not yet observed.
But for the physicists it is not yet entirely certain that it is really about the Higgs.
We know without a doubt the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a large physical conference in Kyoto, but there are still no data to be fully secure about it.
Nevertheless, let's assume that it's actually the Higgs, because there seems to be only a small risk of deception, and we're looking at what's going on.
There is a legally binding law in this world that makes it impossible for two objects to be present at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to break this rule - and don't try it too hard as you get hurt.
For even if particle physics is a really rare world, it turns out that it also applies to it a similar law: the Pauli's principle of exclusion, which says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quanten state", while this "state" consists in large and full of some of their properties.
From this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner there are the good citizens who are called Fermione and are polite to obey the principle of Pauli.
And in the other, the Bosons move, a bad band of anarchists, who are not sacred - in any case not this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are divided into two groups, according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Labors (which is absolutely amazing): the mesones that we will not be treated here and the "power particles", through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
But it must be stressed here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of exceptional banality: the photon or the "light particles", which is the "boat" of electromagnetic power.
If a particle with an electrical charge is accelerated or the direction is changed, the electromagnetic field is precisely "distorted" in this place, like a brick stone, which has been thrown into a pond.
This "distortion" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "bearer of power".
Stable Field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "distorted" so that this boson shows itself.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the faulter must reach very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be crushed by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator like CERN is needed - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a range of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the higgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold from itself at the refrigerator.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the others (as well as the photos) do not have a mass.
For what can all these research be "good" now, does Mrs. Plamondo ask?
For science, they serve the verification of the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physicists to accurately investigate all differences between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
In addition, there are numerous physicists who hope to find such deviations, since the smallest difference opens a door to a "new physics" and could stop some holes in the model.
One has to say that the latter still has great shortcomings, as it does not provide an explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (new ups!).
However, such deviations have not yet been found at CERN.
Effects
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there was no such thing.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs did not expect their work to trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the deceased physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first permanent laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962, already said that the laser was seen at the beginning as a "labor play".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also be made out of all the instruments that surround research.
For example, in 1969, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in the optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as "Eights" and introduced the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that you can never really know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die... ↔ Le Devoir
With its Committee on "Dating in Honor", Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate needs to be resumed in a short time, although a draft legislation is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in Monterégie.
The prostate cancer that infected him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I made seven years," he said half a year, in his home bed for Palliative Care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived earlier.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease makes her work: an immeasurable weakness prevents her from going alone to the toilet and even eating herself.
Sitting on the table in front of a delicious lunch, he will volunteer to help with his meal.
It is even possible to smile at him and talk to the strangers who are concerned about him, bring him his medications, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my throughput, because this is embarrassing," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is pinning in a stand," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the home of Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the stage of childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the ability of the person," he states.
Because, in the view of several people working in Palliative Care, large events take place in the midst of these steps.
Patients who are admitted to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they will no longer be overwhelmed by the doctors and nurses who care for them with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by biting".
But because of the disease, I really got to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in life," she says before she accepts that you put on a mask that helps her breathing.
In the coming days, however, she still expects a final visit from her son, who comes from Italy.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois you can offer a group of voluntary body care and care for the consumption of food.
Palliative care is then used if there are no other options.
To make death more pleasant.
In Quebec, 11,700 people arrive at a bed for palliative care.
That's very little if you take into account that one day we're all going to die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the world.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
You give the dying person a oral treatment with Brandy or Pepsi according to your wishes.
Diabetics should no longer control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of the day.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help our relatives and patients alike," says Care Director Nathalie Savard.
Victor-Gadbois at home is not a day like the other one.
In addition to an old man of 93, who enjoys the last family meeting in the court and is well supported by his pillows, while attacking his honors, a young man of 36 will die, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children, in a tragic way after he has tried everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been laid with cancer patients under 45 years of age," explains Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the home of Victor-Gadbois come from their place of residence, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care that should relieve the suffering of patients if the latter have reached the end stage of their life, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Home Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Domestic Palliative Care in the Greater Montreal area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
This is precisely the great inadequacies in the health care of Quebecs, which ensures that several doctors specialized in palliative care are opposed to the adoption of a law on the regulation of death aid and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been on the move, signed by prominent figures of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not effective enough to ensure that all rights to high-quality palliative care are transferred to death aid before acceptance.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who had been in the emergency hospital for 14 days without taking action to relieve her.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite worst forecasts until the last day.
The survival chances of Hélène Richard were already minimal when she discontinued a serious chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she told me that she regretted that I was giving up the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No Almighty Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have prayed to die thank the care staff for not having done this wish after their pain was reduced by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care in pain treatment is not omnipotent.
According to Elsie Monereau, the head of the Palliative Care Society of the House of Palliative Care of the Greater Montreal area, 8% of patients do not talk about pain treatment.
Thus, at the end of life, doctors often go back to the terminal sedation, which leads to patients either sporadicly or permanently until their death.
We can't do as much as we can if we don't see this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly be able to return to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not reduced, all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want you to sleep with me," but "I want my pain to be reduced."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate chains large sizes in Quebec
Officials of the road construction office, companies of the construction industry, money-creators of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso.
A "industry" which was very expensive for the taxpayer Quebecs, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is remarkable how the system is falling apart since drastic measures have been taken," says Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
The scandal was discovered by him on the basis of an in-depth investigation of the distortions in relation to the road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had only agreed to object.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and the appointment of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010", he stressed, "the Ministry of Transport alone had delivered a billion dollars to the contracts", because some were suffocating their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already fallen two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals".
A 2011 life call, permanent anti-corruption unit
The permanent anti-corruption unit, which was launched in 2011, is also engaged in major efforts by the government’s troops to investigate economics, research and analysts.
In addition, the police of the Marchau-Truppe, which has had the effect since 2009, that Montreal's "canalization cartel" is taking place in the artistic appearance of the detainee's contracts...
In the last few weeks, she has specifically carried out domestic investigations and charged with fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
He is suspected of having received money from him repeatedly in the exchange for public contracts.
In addition to the road construction engineers of Montreal, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, Tony Accurus and Lino Zabito were explicitly accused.
Finally, he gave an overview by explaining to the Commission the way in which the "system" is functionally used for the procurement of public contracts.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a broker associated with the Mafia, who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito played his hand everywhere in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were then in power.
He was also asked to have organised an illegal acquisition for former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Canal contracts, the cost of which was artificially charged
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as savings of $736,000 as a counter-performance for sewerage contracts, the cost of which he artificially paid.
Other officials of the road construction office have admitted that they allowed themselves to be smeared by artificially flashing the calculations with wrong additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that filled his boxes with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay withdrew at the beginning of November, which broke Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Members of Montreal to beat the alarm.
As mayor of the city district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she refused to sell a municipal base since 2010 that for 5 million dollars had been acquired and for 1.6 million had been sold to builders in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
From the investigation, which is finally carried out, she says that she "draws to a path that allows her to understand the way of operation of the system underway by Ameis to stop the evil and to push the guilty".
She says that the procedure was "suffering, but positive".
However, we are in the process of cleansing the wounds, but we only need a unit of detection for Montreal, as well as a supervision to prevent a return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes, on the other hand, that "Officers have stolen several hundred million dollars", but especially is concerned about the role of "mandates who are about the tactics in the picture" if they were not involved in fraud!
As a result of a 70% share of black money in the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he said, "I was told that this was only a weakness of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit the donations to $100, which, according to him, would not change the situation: "If election expenditure is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation."
He recommends a complete revision of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws by taking the matter to heart."
If this story damages the international view of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau calls on those who laugh about it to take a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season you have adopted a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it by personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day, I make progress on her side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play every day.
And in a game, it's even easier.
It's all going very fast in football.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress.
They therefore take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new accesses of this summer are used to producing very high levels of games.
You also know that every training unit is successful.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer the stars and want to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makele, who played in the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti respects all technicians.
In the League 1 there is currently no comparable person, and it is among the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with viewed associations.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The confidence he has put in me is also an explanation for my performance.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In the League 1 Lyon took us the seat of the top rider.
But we're lying in the back.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have thus qualified for the eighth final.
What is the objective of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on everything is possible.
However, we will have our words against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to become the first of our group in front of Porto so that we can extract the back play of the eighth final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a major European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for...
In order to become a large European association, Paris must win titles and become a long-term name.
This is not the case today.
The PSG is financially able to accept concrete forms of this project.
Would it be a big mistake not to win the title in the League 1 as it was in the last season of the case?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year we are really at heart to cancel this title.
Last season, we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Usually you should be with 79 points master...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right thing to do.
Even if the great teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux ring the title, I think we have the chance to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players that we have, it is normal that a lot of us are expected.
We accept that perfectly.
However, if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something that you can imagine, it is certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what people are still waiting for.
We could never win every weekend with a 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up with time.
In the Champions League, we've proven strength.
Look at Manchester City, an association that has not been able to qualify for the eighth final since two seasons, and that has also done huge expenditure!
With regard to the invested sums, you believed in the game break with 15 points of advantage!
That said our opponents and the French championship would be left out of sight.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good in the last season, were "boasted by this new PSG".
This shows that the League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that we have finally won them in spite of all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much better to talk about a "Zlatan-dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many doors.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of the League 1.
Everywhere he played, he led to the fact that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects those who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also enables all others to make progress.
How have you experienced the EM 2012 with the French National Team?
Like a disappointment.
It was in my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from spending some time in the game.
I've seen things that I've gone from.
Today I have managed to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lessons, and today we have to show exemplary behavior.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deshamps at the top of the "bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the WM.
The national coach is strict, the players are close and ready to win.
Just like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deshamps will lead the "bleus" to Brazil.
Is this a game of action forced on 16 October in Spain (1:1)?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone's been working for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
Moreover, as often as in these technologies, a political vision can be grasped: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is a virtual currency (but in dollars, euro, etc. convertible) as well as a protocol for safe exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousands of websites accept bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, Bitcoin's course fell to $2,5 months later, before he recovered to about 10 dollars today (the courses are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in a report published in October on virtual currencies.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "like the usual currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits", which are used to move forward in a video game that can be won or bought through games (and sometimes also exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed by a central authority every time.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are at the same time the account holder, auditors, cash issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose another address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A series of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are available in the account book distributed throughout the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is about a mathematical task that is started on the computer, while the winner, who is a type of provisional central banker, has the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a fragment of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computer "take" the new transaction and add a number before the whole is "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is correct.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay with the same money twice (less than 10 minutes) for fraud, only one of the two transactions would be validated from the network and the other will remain unconnected, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task gets 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward will be halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be divided into a hundred million-dollar set, leaving a certain space...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement in the calculation performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide Bitcoin services were attacked and the bitcoin devices were stolen.
"The weakness used does not concern the actual protocol," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a real money-paying company and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB shall also report on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows this flaw.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dori Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analysed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of the Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "Mega closing sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," thanks to Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a wireless payment with a mobile phone, but uses bitcoin to validate transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by dealers, and the latter need not install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to specify only one address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are overcome in favour of stronger horizontal-oriented systems.
"It will take some time until Bitcoin is implemented, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
In addition, in its report, the ECB intends to reassess the various risks that are considered to be high today in the case of a success of this currency.
We've been removed from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States were expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army seizes the possession of its territory again, and that the Afghan people decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And we ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the injured and the survivors.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their age-olds and archaic traditions, even though they have joined the jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbek and Tads.
Tolerable, sometimes supported by local rebels, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the support point in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, financed by French credit, was well done.
The cargo and tank convoys overrun by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
By the end of 2014, there will be no more flows of Taliban in Kabul.
The conditions have changed since their inconsistencies from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was moved from war because of the fights of the various rebel groups.
Their takeover was then seen as a kind of liberation and a return to security.
The Afghan women paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaida organization, but their situation has not improved so far.
Former Mudschaeddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war again came to power in 2001.
They have turned into business-makers by having seized property of the government to sell them as a building country to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive US procurement of subcontracts.
They had been kidnapped, and most of them were not even involved in the fight.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that does not consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just as those who could make use of American grants: capital flight is considerable.
The young people have stopped the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world, and enjoyed its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people who do not want to return to the obscuranism of the parties themselves or to the corruption of certain executives will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are occupied by mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is viewed everywhere.
There's an army now.
Will the authorities under whose command they will stand be regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to rebuild the militias in the province, which will withdraw from the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from a certain decentralisation in the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, which has existed since the Constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make a centralized state out of it with a strong presidential violence.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, particularly on the occasion of the April 2014 elections.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid for over 50 years and long ago.
Industry has not been re-established, functional construction has not been available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables nothing is produced.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country headed by war for 30 years, State control of the infrastructure would have been necessary.
The news was spread that Afghanistan has huge land assets.
This still reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on site to take care of it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper on site, or without means of transport for export over the mountains, mountain construction is not possible.
The Chinese have already left the copper mines of Mes Aynak, the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) at the huge Buddhist site make their excavations and remain the main employers of the province.
One day, it will also be necessary to re-establish normal relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, largely dependent on imports and exports.
The withdrawal of the French troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls and boys Gymnasia, Institute for French University, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimec) has been set up in 2012 to carry out numerous non-profit activities and measures in dozens of mountain villages for the restoration of agriculture and to be carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation to try to win the "hearts and minds" and to reach the impossible task of compatibility of aid and open actions.
These works, which were necessary for the numerous local workers, can contribute to suppressing the rise: watering, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased agricultural land use.
What kind of souvenir do we have after military spending of two billion euros?
A much smaller budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are often very hard at a height of more than 2000 metres.
In the message, dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from communities of the province of Kapisa have been received.
In order to free farmers from the revolt of foreign groups, as they wish, the continuation of their own statements would be less, well-controlled and they would need direct civil assistance for their benefit.
A Constitution with the Brechtstang in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt has decided to place everything on a map in relation to the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives it unlimited power, more than ever, than it is split.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly would be adopted on the next day.
Just one week ago, the Head of State had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of his work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been based on a provisional, multiple-changed text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal interdependence.
This new initiative has only provided for an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the President continues to "abstain from his "autocrat delirium", by continuing to "break his word" and "the law with his feet".
On the part of its supporters, it is ensured that there is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period, which the brothers are forced to ignore their plans to explain to the Egyptians the text section of the section.
For the President, it is also a way to regain its public and democratic legitimacy while the protest is defeated throughout the country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American weekly show, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will be willing to vote.
When the Egyptian people are put to an extreme vote with this back-up: "either you agree to my draft or I retain the unlimited power," the latter should probably end after the constitution has been adopted.
85 mostly Islamic members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals have not met the call.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they have turned away because they believe that they have not been able to bring their views into effect.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
To reach the decision-making capacity, 11 representatives were added to all members of the board yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were adopted unanimously.
The commentators also found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed in the hour for the prayer, as some members of the board felt that the deadline for the constitutional assembly was not enough.
The text that was adopted yesterday evening consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention, is finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and says that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafiist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made it possible to apply more stringently.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is evidence of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hospitality" refers to the liberals who view this only as a propaganda strike.
Because according to them, Islamization of the Constitution takes place over other articles.
In doing so, they have given particular attention to Article 220, which recognises the advisory function of Al-Azhar University, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with Sharia's laws.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "people who are invited to an opinion have not been elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are also raised by the fact that the next rector of this university is far less consistent than the present one.
"At this time there is no concrete religious commitment to be recognized.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral work on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he argues, "that, in relation to Article 220, there may be a greater clarity, since the terms used are reprehensible to the religious vocabulary.
This refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic case law, Am. d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised about the extent to which civil courts are competent to decide on it."
In addition to his religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised by the extensive powers he gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslims argue that these comparisons with the former regime are significantly reduced.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Nor will civil proceedings be prohibited in military courts, as the human rights associations have required.
The latter also share their fears about the text they see as a threat to freedom.
The existence of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article concerns the protection of women, Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch points out.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to deliver himself on TV last night, demonstrations were planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists expect holy places, the world’s navel and a sea from the sun
The Promised Land combines in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort, and unaffected nature.
AIF calls you the five most important reasons for a visit to Israel.
Before the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It means that all those who pray in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the turning of water into wine at a wedding feast, the going on the water, the silence of the sea-storm and the fishing.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the saints, however, are located in Jerusalem.
Here believers perform the path of suffering or crossroads of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The road begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretoria, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old city to the tomb church on Mount Golgotha, where the crossroads, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here is a Christian view of the scourge of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where a Christian legend grew from which the cross was made for the cross of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place of the Jews - the complainants, the remnant of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different religious backgrounds leave behind Zettel with wishes that then go to fulfillment.
Take a trip to the height
The ruins of the fortress Massada form the remains of the secret hiding from enemies, who had Herod the Great built for his family in 25th century C.E.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains in 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountain climbers can reach the ruins of their own strength.
Everyone else brings an airway to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, between 1600 and 2040 meters high is the famous Hermon ski area, where it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you reach there with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometres.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the hilltop.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
On only one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting ones should be paid a visit.
Among them is the Israeli Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There are old Qumran manuscripts or written scrolls from the Dead Sea found in caves in the Jewish desert, as well as some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection of works of the impressionists and expressionists will be displayed there in Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathers at that time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum leaders nor souvenir shops.
Entry is free, and donations are rejected in principle.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, is one of the most frightening chapters in history.
The most exciting department is the monument for the children, built to remember the 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room, complete darkness prevails.
The star's funnel.
And they pronounce the names of the Jews and the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for your health
The three main recreational areas of Israel lie on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
There are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and Oceania in each of the three places.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also built in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is built all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a position of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus even carries non-sweetness on the surface without problems.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt) and helm, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and for the relaxation of unscrupulous nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Ageing
These secrets are the old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous sea road, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia were linked.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to reports, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda, with which he led a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to wander through the narrow streets named after star signs.
Fortune is supposed to be the legend of everyone who touches the walls in the gas with its star sign.
In Jaffa you can meet newly mentioned couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo-terms.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can run through the Roman theater and conquer the fortress of the Crusades.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman states, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre features evening concerts and operas.
Bookmark List for Tourists
When you go to Israel, you don't worry about your bad English skills: about 30% of the Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is not taken in euro, but in dollars that can be easily converted into shifts (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shifts).
In the city you usually proceed with the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a fast-track train and in Haifa the country's only bus line with six stations connecting the underground to the capital.
It's just a underground stopway.
A journey within the city costs up to 1.5 hours, regardless of the means of transport.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath will be celebrated in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is at peace.
And on Sunday morning, the week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only delicious food is served, excluding pig meat, seafood, fish without mushrooms and food containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between various dishes with ham and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus pasta, various sauces, fried beans from pure beans and herbs (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of the cities of Israel, there are no wandering dogs.
For this there are many well-bred cats that stream through the streets comfortably and inexhaustably.
Tonight you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like to live places and don't say no to candy.
A car per day costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance also costs $15 a day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Access cards for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
_Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the adventurers and leisure seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists arrived in the Promised Land, corresponding to an increase of 51% in 2010 compared to the comparative period, before the lifting of the visa requirement on 9 February 2011.
"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While MPs and civil law discuss the benefits of the law on mandatory language testing for migrants, criminals are already dealing with false certificates
Each year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its only goal is to earn money for the entertainment of the families left at home.
On 1 December, a law entered into force which, according to each migrant worker, must pass a test certifying the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this regulation applies only to migrants who want to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing sector and in retail trade.
However, the tests are to be carried out in the future for all guest workers according to the Federal Migration Authority.
It is not only a test of language, but also a test of Russian history and the principles of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both maintenance and extension of work permits.
Exceptions apply only to nationals of countries in which Russian is an official language.
This law also excludes persons who have received their training products and diplomas prior to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, problems and protection of rights
The whole of the test sites will be under the auspices of the Puschkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can pass the tests in all cities; more than 160 centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to launch the tests was supported by the representatives of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, before the law entered into force in the press, citizens' rights raised the following question: What is the whole of it?
What changes does the rule require language skills, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
First and foremost, the spokesperson of the Migration Authority is to reduce the number of forced workers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
However, their rights must already be protected against their departure.
Only organised recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Migrants face problems without professions, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language will meet people with evil intentions who will put him under the pretext of helping him into a dark, close Barake, where he will hang with dozens of his own months without food and documents and be created 12-14 hours a day.
We have a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"In the home you will be promised a promise, and on arrival you will be deceived, get your passports taken off and won't receive the promised salary," confirmed the head of the chief immigration administration of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Scharipow.
Don't jump, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they do not only control the language of the country of destination, but are unable to express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, it is not as much their fault as the evil: only a few Turkmen, usbeken and tadbeans can provide only a reasonable basic education.
For there is not even money in their families to feed the children, because they are reluctant to buy decent clothing, shoes and school stuff.
As a teenager, these children then seize the first opportunity to earn money.
"It is difficult without language," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizens' rights underline the following important aspects of the law.
Only migrants with legal status must pass the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no exam and therefore no official work.
In the meantime, most of the guest workers remain illegally employed in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Prohibited access to unauthorized"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic harshness and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made fast and only for half a thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and then there are cases of oppression.
"They want one- or two-hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says the Tadshike Umed Huschkadamow to journalists.
"Just don't look at the cost of the wrong paper"
Already on the day the law entered into force, it appeared that not only the migrants' registration documents could be faked.
Some false certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been accused by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with a normal color printer.
Of course, the new owners didn't get it anyway: every migrant who hoped to be able to save the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot be bought simply, both public and civil law agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they will receive time for a language course.
In addition, new arrivals without language skills are offered in areas where there is no need for active understanding with people.
Ministry of the Interior ignores the illegal arms market
The proportion of legal weapons in criminal matters is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior plans to strengthen the arms law for private arms owners.
In this way, the authorities respond to the latest events: injured in shooting at weddings and seven deaths in the killing of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to prohibit the wearing of non-lethal weapons in the public and raise the age of the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal has been supported by the Chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarovaja, and has promised that the amendments to the law on arms will be tabled shortly in the Duma.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "drawing the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet asking the authorities to take away the author - representatives of various arms associations - from "free abbreviations".
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is very small, said the criminal judge, Wasilij Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed using the registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012, while 1,168 thousand criminals were reported for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that an intensification of the law on private arms owners will not prevent criminals from operating on the black market.
At present, you can find any weapon in Moscow according to the authors for a small amount of money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons reach the black market through several channels.
There are five such main channels, reports former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who has been active in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff for ten years.
Screenshot of a website that accepts arms orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasus themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel, illegal weapons come to steal the orders of criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen from both the police's arms chambers and directly from law enforcement officials.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons warehouses.
In many military camps there were frequent explosions.
"There is evidence that in some cases it was a firefight to cover the lack of weapons," says the former military officer.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers also make a contribution to the black market.
"Today, there are numerous private weapons factories that do not maintain international competition and that is why the weapons are under hand on the black market, for example in Moscow, and worsen," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggler.
Especially many guns and weapons come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a own, sometimes handmade production and a mafia that organizes the fraud," explains the former military officer.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels involved in supplying the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was produced by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Government Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on the topic of weapons.
The majority of the illegal weapons are identified by the army and the law enforcement authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there through the "guilt of those responsible who have managed to do their work with weapons", says the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% go back to theft in arms production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant who does not want to be known as a weapon ensures that weapons found in illegal excavations have long since no one buys them as they are old.
According to him, it is more common for dealers to take care of the afterlife in a warehouse.
A gun, such as a TT-type gun, is purchased through a Fännrich.
The weapon is exposed and handed over by the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two stores," he tells
"The police, of course, know everything about the decision and therefore, if they cannot comply with the crime detection plan, periodically purchase control in traders offering illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"As in the luxury store."
Buyers and sellers find each other most often about acquaintances.
I looked at web pages and blogs when someone paid attention to me and suggested that I come to Begowaja station, where a person would wait for me who would take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the weapon I only got there

"To provide a weapon, I need a friend who has contacts," the sales consultant tells. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers in the markets, but you have to go there and deal with a code like "of Ivan Ivanovich, who lets the daughter lose a tooth".
I'm even going to a few beats right now about a friend I trust.
He also gives me the beatings just because he knows I don't stab him.
New people are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military-owned Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990s when he wrote an article on this topic.
The schemes have not changed according to him.
He got a photo album in which "all possible" was recorded.
"I felt like I was in the luxury store," the military remembers.
According to Baranez, the buyer doesn't get the cat in the bag, but he can try everything.
I buy as a potential customer not only, but go with the seller in the forest, and there we set up a target disc.
"I can shoot there then, and when I'm convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the action.
Buying out of the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "VContacts", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
No paper is needed or there are personal meetings.
"They only need the appropriate amount of money," it says in the advertisement on the website "Buy guns or weapons".
There users will post your orders and ask questions.
Will it also be sold to minors?
"Of course without a license", user asks "Iwan" (verbal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," says the laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the service on the network.
People come like hungry fish when they feed and then land in Siberia and can smell coal
Military Commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard from the following scheme: The website is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The persons responsible shall accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money over a bank machine.
"As a response he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," reports the press speaker of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that to conclude, you can also go out empty and come behind bars when you place an inquiry on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the service on the network.
"People come like hungry fish in the feeding and then land in the Siberian labor camp and be allowed to swallow coal," he says.
A Makarrow for 100 US dollars
When buying illegal firearms, experts are expected to calculate prices of $100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the organization "Prava na oryzhie" you can buy a Makarrow-type gun for $100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to half a month.
The weapon is issued in military weapons warehouses by observers in the middle range.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of criminals with illegal weapons throughout Russia decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand between January and October 2011, while the number of reported cases of theft and repression in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices declined by 7.8%.
Fast-food and supermarket workers in the United States
Every fourth U.S. youth ever sits behind the box of Mc Donald's
In the past few days there have been massive protests in the United States against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to explode, or whether they will soon be returned to the air.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several non-profit organisations on the left.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and Fast Food employees, the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
So far, this industry of the economy has hardly been organized.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the United States, attracting millions of customers, which at times led to handfuls of hands.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, put down their work and reached together with trade unions and left activists branches of the chain, whose target group is low and middle income.
Walmart sells all products, from winds over hunting weapons and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart branches are between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the low-paid Walmart employees only buy at their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods only so cheaply because employees are badly paid.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as missing fork stackers or hand scanners.
The participants of the protests called for wage increases on Black Friday and expressed their concern that the contribution for the business-friendly health insurance amounted to $30 per 100 per month.
A typical Walmart employee, who earns $9.5 an hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University of Berkeley argue that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, Walmart would cost 3.2 billion dollars.
That's about 1.1% more than they're now paid for.
If Walmart would completely convert the wage increases to the customers, each purchase cost her only 46 cents more in the future.
This would be more than $12,39 for them today.
Walmart's supporters are satisfied that there were only nine states in protests and they did not protect the company from any loss.
The Black Friday lasted in its cargo from 8 o'clock at night on Thursday to midnight the next day, and Walmart sold about 5000 items per second during this period.
In total, the Walmart cassettes carried out almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The spokesperson of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the left-hand side of the Huffington Post that all "less than five" Walmart employees reduced the work and the protest station was only "a further PR print" of the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where, however, their goal was not Walmart's branches (which are not desired in this advanced city and are therefore not yet existing), but McDonald's and other affordable restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick days, and you won't be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage is in accordance with federal and New York law at 7.25 dollars per hour.
In Fast-Food Restaurants, the minimum wage is increased by and by, however, not too strong, and on average, their simple employees in New York receive 8.90 US dollars per hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
As far as it's possible to get out of New York with so little money, I don't understand.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. youths were behind McDonald's school, but the young people were still living with their parents.
No one could see the main source of income or plant to stay there longer.
Now I have interviews with McDonald's employees and people who complain that they have to come out with this reward and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal Forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which began at 6.30 p.m. on Thursday morning before McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a double of the present minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of unions in the fast-food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the management of the company, the pursuit of this goal and the removal or release of trade union members.
On the other hand, corporate governance does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of unions in the fast food sector is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff flow.
Unsaturated
On this day, loud protests took place before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The high point of the protests was a meeting on Wednesday before McDonald's at Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, among them council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick days, and you won't pay for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should support the fast-food employees together so that they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the US Fast Food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people on the spot, of which at Wiitem not all are employed in the fast-food sector, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet to be seen whether the funk of these protests will mobilize all masses.
"The brain can only be moderately listed so far"
The theme of the extended reality, popular with modern technologies, is seen in recent times usually by the lens of a special glasses.
First, in the summer at his annual conference, Google presented a functioning model, then in November it was announced that Microsoft had also registered a corresponding patent.
In the discussion with the leader of the Group for Interactive 3D Technologies in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it becomes clear that the glasses for the company's scientists were just a transition station.
It drives the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with only hands and create virtual spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far, mankind has largely remained stuck in the phase in which pixels are worked on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to predict 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox consoles and Kinect sensors are progressing, and today Xbox is no longer sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in movement control.
- What is yet to come?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many still play on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the issue is not yet decisive.
We are trying to change this, working on real three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world in our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment, is recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of this clumsy virtual reality helmet!
- What do you think of language control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the solution to all this because it raises questions about privacy, because it does not always want to inform everyone about its actions and intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with computers is good, however, each in its specific niche.
For example, we worked in the field of managing objects in public places on a project where we experimented with short and short, instead of downloading gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by an armband that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of an armband watch.
However, overall the future consists of mixed types of control, such as gestures and language.
- How's that?
- For example, would you ask me to give you this spray dose?
They say it and show it at the same time.
- Usually I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
- Is that what you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at any time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the next time we will have to work on developing new types of sensors, which will allow us to learn more about people's reactions.
These can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer a good solution in the deep, which is very important.
- What demands do you make from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is it lacking in resolution, depth or anything else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Thus, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
Not only the resolution along the X- and the Y-, but also along the Z-axis must be taken into account.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
Human movements are said to be extremely dynamic and open, the present 30 fps are too small for gestures.
Stephen Betishas developed a contact sensor in our laboratory in Redmond with a adjustable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work, I needed exactly one device, only without contact control and with more pictures per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It does not serve to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras might solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, kinect-like system in which we could play with different camera trends to determine how this helps us in the three-dimensional detection of a position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft did not present his glasses to the public, unlike Google.
Don't you think that with regard to the application of the technology of the extended reality all day long, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it's not nice to keep a smartphone in the raised hand all the time, but I think: The greatest variant would be an "changing" extended reality in which we could switch over a cloud from the glasses to the smartphone,
The glasses are a personal gadget and there lies their strength (privates can only see you), but also their weakness, because an extended reality through glasses prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
- Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also normal mortals.
There is a problem that often points to critics of this idea: There is no sensitive reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers do your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often speak of the fact that the extended reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of tactical perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual design presentation.
She's got great pressure!
However, there are technologies that are actually focused on giving the "images in the air" something hand-held, for example, the interference of some controlled ultrasonic rays at a certain point where the finger is located creates a feeling that is still as weak as someone breathing over the handballs.
There are also bands for the wrist, which affect the nerve transmissions in the fingers, this is also a potential direction.
- Did you try to list the brain?
Does it make you think it feels what it should feel when it just sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried yet.
Here is another task that we will still have to fight for, namely a person who is physically in a closed space to believe, instead of being in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with treadmills (other than in fitness studios), mobile platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be moderately listed, and many years of work are still ahead of us.
This is what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive to a researcher: we are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde" dedicated to the inhabitants of the city who form the Avantgarde of art and culture.
On the read list, high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the city's borders and often find recognition in Europe, without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the bears dressed in red, once met at the Russian Museum, once at the summer garden, once at the scene meetings or on skirmishes.
Where the pictures of Kirill Miller are also displayed, they attract large human masses.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical social-philosophical artists in Petersburg who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the 80s or early 90s.
He is also a man of the city, and by his presence on the street, his fellow citizens smile in the face and provide them with good pay.
Recently, he took a triangle and became Petersburg's Tregorgel player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist's design, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not for example in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color Red as fashion designer, which fits in with the optics and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the grain, aggression and bad behavior is called out.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my last provocations was an invitation to talk.
When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At a cultural exhibition in Newskij, where my works were exhibited.
I understand I have to go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters went to the end at that time, and new and free painters like I were incomprehensible.
I was pleased with the paintings of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina" from which "Pushkinskaja 10" was created, and then it was only finished.
It brings me to the theater, to fashion, to music, actually to everything, except literature.
It was important for me to be at the centre of the Petersburg culture where the best creative artists should be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a room in Puschkinskaja 10, where there was a musical-artist club for the Bohemian house of the Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazz, and I also remember how Schnur came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to play back, wore tight trikots and also belonged to the composer Igor Wdowin, mentioned today.
When the group started to play live, it became from its Leningrad.
Trachtenberg moderated many programs prior to the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also have its origin in the art clinic.
There our staff and family guests went.
I am a hero of the past century, when culture meant something else.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press, where it was about the award of "the personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and so I was at the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an undetectable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the modernity and the sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and gets scared to be like that.
In a clown, it confuses everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let us save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress completely.
Now everyone takes care of the clothes and focuses on the outside and not on the inside of the person.
But maybe you can't give a man a hand, but you should spit him in the face.
The deception disappears through the veil.
- We've seen you recently in the role of the city organ player. - A culture city should have such a hero.
Who if I don't?
- Can commercial art be nice, too?
- Today commercial art must be careful, considerate and funny.
We see the collapse of cultures.
The people used to be great groups: the Bohemians loved one another and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are micro-Communitys, and it's hard to like everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar note that everybody likes.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- But several thousand come to the scene of Stas Michailow!
- There are women left to him, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything goes on.
I have supporters, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not to destroy the achievement.
In my youth, I painted images that were even in a series of works by Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually come only at the end of my career.
Today there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumers have no culture at all, which is quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and denied money to paint.
That's the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's missing from Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
It is said: servants of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
It was different with the real Zarans, because the Zarans may not understand much of culture, but they understand that real experts are needed.
In Moscow there are now good advisers.
In Petersburg we have which experts could be, but they will be blocked because there is a need for higher-ranking experts who properly evaluate the first and free them from the path.
Now it's just your own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters must therefore seek other museums.
- What's wrong with you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding nutrient floor.
On our stones art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural nutrient because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us, that's much less.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed from grants from the city of St. Petersburg
Born in the World Hall
Earth in danger.
Earth warming or collision with Killer Asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earth’s inhabitants on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, is the important question of how we can grow on the planet of gravity or on the planet of replacement?
I do not think there are many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least inhabit hypothetically.
"This is Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are relatively life-friendly, on the surface of Venus there is a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would be possible only in large heights or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in all.
The question of reproduction in all was first addressed by the researchers regarding the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out with plants.
The fourth generation of the heirs raised in the orbit did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
It followed the cultivation of insects, more precisely of small fruit birds (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979, guards were sent to the World Hall to explore how the severity of the development of Embryos was affected.
It develops a very normal kitchen.
But then the problem starts.
"The problem is that the kitchen must be stopped; it must be able to stand on its legs and begin to move," explains Professor of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sichew.
Without solid ground, the kitchens are wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of newborns were completely numbed.
The kitchens did not respond to light and noise.
Four days later, they just died.
"Two times we let the kitchen slip and then put in the whole, because it's just impossible to work there with them," Vladimir Sychew holds for the damaged experiment with the kitchen in all.
The last brute cage with animals flew into the orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" will only contain the same species.
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into everything.
In principle, nothing was identified.
"It was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," notes Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space councils grew up.
The problem of reproduction could not be solved directly in space so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are cut out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive movement.
In contrast to animals, man could do so in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can produce a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
But women have been flying all over the world for 50 years.
The biggest risk was in Tereskowa.
The most valuable thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our movements flew from it, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Does it survive the space flight?
Can they bring a child to the world after this flight?
"Finally no one answered this question," says the Space veteran Watchman Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space trip, the first female cosmonautine, Valentina Tereshkowa, gave a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolayev, was also Kosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman in All, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even carried out work outside the space vehicle, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, there remains a risk.
We have only very few cosmonauts, in which after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more dangerous it is, the more dangerous it is for flights to the Orbit," concludes Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakov, Helder of the Soviet Union and Helder of the Russian Federation.
And yet, mankind must seek new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the production of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaborator in the preparation centre of the cosmonauts is a mandatory station during the preparation of the flight.
Here in a state of swimming, the Cosmonaut Routines win for the work in the open space.
The water represents the insomnia.
Even if adult water is pleasant, it is a strange environment; yet infants feel water as a natural element.
It's as if the little Ichtyander testimony would deny that life in the country went up to the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the fruit water, and that it can then become easier to get used to water.
In principle, it is logical that two weeks have passed from birth to first swimming.
"It's too little time to forget something," says Marina Axenowa, a baby swim instructor.
While for a newborn child, pregnancy is a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of insomnia, the abdominal and pelvic muscle is formed very quickly and thus also decreases the ability to express the child.
Well, let's deal with this by means of birth control.
For example, birth could also take place in a special room to express the child.
"But what happens then?" says the non-significant question by Waleri Poljakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling Earthquake, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be placed in the orbit like an adult for training in a load line.
He will simply miss what is essential to his life.
"This experiment, which we jointly undertake, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring a disabled, totally inappropriate person into the world," says the head of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems Institute RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in the worldall is a mere theory.
But at some point it will be a reality when the inhabitants of the earth in their spaceships break into a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in all.
NKU Chief: Control of the Black System Losed by Indebted Policy
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and appropriate laws in relation to public contracts, but it is not in force.
In the discussion for Aktuálně.cz, this is said by the Vice President of the Höchsten Control Office (NKU), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it has to be applied correctly - and this is not the case with us in my opinion," Kala comments the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint check by Czech and German examiners.
As a negative example of practice, he introduced the position of Prime Minister Petr Necza to the so-called "Black System".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls - so is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must, however, have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come from the president, and the control office, whose duty is once again to control compliance with the law, prevents its activity," Kala states.
At the meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control, you discussed a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of the two countries on public contracts were compared.
What were you doing here?
This is a parallel test with which we started about two years ago.
In simple terms, it is because European legislation determines how public procurement is to be carried out, on which the national legislation is based, and finally there is still the actual practical application.
We have compared all of this with each other, and although the examination is not yet completed, we have been able to find extremely interesting differences. In general, the laws are perhaps even a bit "stronger and more perfect" with us, but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more precise rules again and again, and it is also necessary to address the actual application of the law.
How can the project be a help to you? What happens to you from this project?
Just such joint control could help to stop us from constantly trying to improve the laws and reduce and austerity thresholds if this seems not to have a particularly positive effect.
Economics means to acquire a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and to exclude illegal areas or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we also achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even so that we load the system in this way only with excessive paper scrap, and those who are looking for gaps in the system have much easier to use the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They are talking about the problems of the practical implementation of the Czech Conciliation Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here like our NKU, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German pendant is the NKÚ of the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to that of us and also has a college which is just a bit different.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. that there are these accounting courts in each of the federal countries - in which the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal resources, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the Landesbanks.
As for German legislation, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would compare this without specific details only slightly, but Germany is, in some respects, often referred to as an example, but certainly cannot be said that Germany is better at all.
Is this perhaps the fact that the exams are better there?
This certainly does not, but, as I say, I do not particularly like such comparisons.
It should also be noted that those countries that are a model for us also have problems to fight.
Otherwise they wouldn't have anything to do with our authority, would they?
With regard to the Czech legislation, which was important to your authority to novellation of the award law, do you already feel any effects?
In view of the fact that this novelle is only in force for a short time, it still does not work in our tests.
Since our checks are subsequently carried out, we have to count here with a certain delay.
The impact we have had in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Recognition of risks of non-economicity" and examined and analysed with this almost 14,000 public contracts - will naturally affect the changes here, as thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, etc.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positive, or will the system be charged with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that this will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be complied with.
Under the previous rules, the persons subject to an examination against the carrier (e.g. in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) are therefore obliged to account for any non-compliance with the award law with budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even harder?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system only places bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
First of all, let's say which way is not objective.
The Prime Minister said very soon that the ODS would not inform the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "Black System" - what exactly is that?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
However, a law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, it cannot simply come from the chairman of the government, and the control office, whose duty is now to control compliance with the law, cannot prevent its activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he can't say that we do as if there was nothing.
The award law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain proceedings - and this is also correct for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic when the offerer is excluded with the best offer only because of form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be properly applied - and that is what I think is lacking in us.
On the streets there are single ice levels, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there are partly snow and ice levels.
Mostly, however, the roads are well-drived, with increased caution being offered.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the Karlsbad district, the streets were well-dried this morning, isolated snow and ice fields.
The temperatures decrease to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it will become somewhat warmer.
In the region it is no longer cutting, and in the deeper altitudes there is only a thin snow cover.
However, there are about 30 cm of snow on the slopes of the Erzgebirge.
According to the district street watch, there was limited visibility due to fog.
The R6 fastway and the first road class roads in the region are currently unrestricted.
However, attention is paid, for example, to bridges where the roads are required and smooth.
At the same time, all roads of the second and third road classes, including the mountain roads, are possible.
On these roads, however, partial snowflakes are required or exhausted.
In particular, increased attention is therefore offered in higher levels.
Districts of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets of eastern Bohemia, there is danger of ice levels, in higher levels and in the mountains, along the streets is still an excellent snowshoe, and the road and highway direction is shared on their websites.
The road masters warn drivers from ice-creams, which can occur especially in higher positions in the Pardubice area.
In particular, it is possible to arrive on the roads of the second and third road classes in the districts of Lanškron, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are treated chemically.
Snow is located on the streets in the Giant Mountains and the Orlicé Mountains.
An excellent snowshoe is located in high altitudes on the streets of the districts of Rychnov nad Knězhnu and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia it is mostly sunny or hotter today, and it remains largely unbeatable.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
Pilsen District
The roads in the Pilsen district are now well-drived, but local attention is offered, and the route is to be adapted to the weather.
This is cool in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing point.
Since it has been cut before and the temperatures then drop, it can come to ice levels on the streets.
In addition, the area is to be counted with fog, but the view will improve in the course of the day.
These data are from the district road masters.
The motorway D5 is practically unrestricted, but increased attention, however, recommends the road masters between the 80th and 131 kilometers.
The roads of the first road class are mainly dry but frozen through.
In the south of the districts Pilsen and Tachov, however, it can come to ice levels in part.
The roads of the second and third road classes are wet, and therefore the reference here also applies to possible sections required.
Drivers should be particularly careful on the less frequent roads in the area of Bohmerwald.
Olomouc District
With snowflakes today, drivers must be counted, which are heading towards the altitudes in the Olomouc district.
After the use of streaming vehicles, snow mattsch remains on the pass Červenohorské sedlo as well as on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Night snowflake forced the road masters to use, in the district of Šumperk, according to data from the road administration about 3 cm of snowfall.
In the other areas of the district, the roads are usually unrestricted.
"In the area of Šumperk, the heights are still snowiest.
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers have to count towards Jeseník with snowmatsch," said one employee of the Šumperk Road Administration today compared to the agency ČTK.
Their colleagues in the district of Jeseník also had to go out at night, according to their statements, the roads are free and wet to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are unrestricted, but in the Šternberk district, the drivers have to drive carefully in forest areas, as the roads are still damp.
District of Ústí nad Labem, District of Liberec
In North Bohemia, road masters report just as many bad road sections as possible.
In addition to several places with snow or ice fields, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice is blocked in the district of Ústí n.K. according to data from the traffic police.
The temperatures are also below zero, so that snow and ice are kept on the streets. From the deep plains, especially south-east of the Bohemian Central Mountains, no problems have been reported, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Ice pellets are reported in particular from the district of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this in the night - rain and melting snow, in the night cloudless sky and frost.
The main routes and road I/13 at the border of the districts Ústí n.L. and Liberec are reported under bad traffic conditions.
The closure of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary because of the axles that were pushed from the snow elaste to the road.
Šimon Ornest: We want to collect positive energy at our concerts
What do you think should take place in less than one month of the world's transition?
This is one of those disaster reports that we welcome.
With our band The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world’s outflow.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the world’s decline.
Can you present the project closer to our readers?
This is a nationwide benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this we want to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is predicted for 21 December at 11:10 a.m. tomorrow.
On the day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts are held at the same time as 21:00 in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concert is about the time when the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, located in a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who's this idea from?
Originally from me, we then developed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the world from falling apart, but we also want to reflect, together with the public, on the condition in which we once gave this world to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, pockets and key hooks against the world's entry, with which we can also support people through www.e-tap.cz.
The Band The Tap Tap has also included the so-called Hymne against the world’s decline with the title “The World’s Fall off”.
Already today, the Hymne on YouTube is very popular. Will they also appear on the benefit concerts?
Of course, and quite to the end, it is assumed that everything will work out and that the world will not go away...
The hymn is to be sung by all the performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the Hymns will be transmitted live together in a direct switch from the Czech TV.
The text of the Hymne comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, and Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to work with both of you?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is linked to the realization of many benefit events and concerts...
We are trying to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has shown that most people are interested in and have fun in working with us.
What is the purpose of delivering the concerts against the world’s decline?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studio, where we have been working for six years together with the Association Tap at the Jedlikka Institute.
The students of the Jedlikka Institute are regularly assisted by lecturers who help them in various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlikka Institute, a building is to be built in which we will then take part with this project.
Several groups and interpreters appear at each concert.
What criteria have you chosen?
We wanted to establish a programme that addresses all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, China, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý appear.
For more information, see www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "great events" planned for the future?
In May, for the first time, we arrive at Prague Spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we also want to be present at the Czech House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, would like to associate this with the appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not just small, so far you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you handle these trips logistically and organisationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs have to be transported in the luggage room. We also have to include a lot of tools and other luggage...
Nonetheless, it has always been without problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us that I have sometimes been partially surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we were the longest, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad, you have a comparison of what it looks like in individual countries with freedom of access, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than we do, we witnessed in Russia that everything in the East is still in its beginnings.
On the other hand, Moscow is absolutely not disabled. It is still unusual when someone in the wheelchair is traveling alone in the city centre.
It is not yet obvious that a wheelchair driver is being set up, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to highlight the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to recover from the further developed countries?
There's still a lot of things that we're going to hang back...
However, it should be noted that improvement of the situation still depends on the efforts of the affected.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently into public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not uncommon that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in social events there, where we are a little ahead of the band The Tap Tap to the West!
Respect for the public and freedom of access is a matter, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly wanted personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What motivated you in 1998 to create a band?
At that time, I began as an administrator at the Jedlikka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intense.
And since I'm myself a musician and, among other things, a saxophone player, I've set up a music-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and in time it is, as our moderator, Ládźa Angelovic, to say, something is being done without control (sighs).
But the band was known only in recent years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that cooperation with well-known singers has helped us, and we have also begun to be actively engaged.
We have become aware that if you do something and this is not to be seen outside, your own performance does not exist in any sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also provide good lecturers, high-quality devices, etc.
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that things could be handled differently.
In the show business today often copies one another.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is carefully considered and accepted only after a longer period of time.
There are only a few truly unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression the viewer usually has is of course compassion; this is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not alone and abandoned beings we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, provided they have the means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed, this is not just progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as many people hear?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things and you must also ask for some discipline.
This is, in my opinion, perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have twice a week a trial, they have to complete the preparatory stages and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm is heard by many quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every band that really wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them have been on since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one single: Lady Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come and go, and you can't stop it.
Whoever has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Take place on the day before the predicted World Cup, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 a.m.
The venues are: Incheba Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues will be connected to the conclusion by live switch and it will provide a common interpretation of the Hymne "The World's Fall off" band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the provision of a multifunctional disabled education centre that should be created in Prague under the name of STUDEO at the Jedlikka Institute.
The entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years of age free of charge, cards are available in the pre-sale at Bohemiatic.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was admitted to a ministerial meeting of the member countries of the European Space Organisation (ESA) as the twentieth member of this space authority. Poland is thus the second member of the former Eastern bloc (according to the Czech Republic, which became ESA member on November 12, 2008.
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The way of Poland into space began freely much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish cosmos fans were busy with space travel, which did not always come to understand.
I recall here, for example, the speech by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Enter into the Cosmonautique".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and after years, Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Prize REP-Hirsch, founded by Robert Esnault-Pelt and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's world-renowned contribution to the development of space travel was assessed, among other things, by the appointment of one of the craters on the landscaped side of the moon after him.
Already in 1925, an railway train was built in Poland for which a rocket was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rockets should be used to start or brake the drain.
The information to be provided is exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933 the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered shootings.
The research work was carried out by the Institute of Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokříckiegi.
From the documents submitted, it is evident that the research has been carried out until the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted freely by the march of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, in the press, the design of a photo-electric hunting kit, by Ing. Rohoziński, appeared in the press, and in the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda voietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" was published by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the missile.
Shortly before the war, all projects on the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymcásowy Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work was completed since the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel were published after the war thanks to the work of the Polish space company (Polish Towarzystvo Astronautique) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company was made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problem, in which four extensive articles of space travel are dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space company.
At the time there was already the first satellite technology projects, and it was to be seen that the research of the space would have a future.
As early as 1956, the Polish space company PTA sought to join the International Federation for Space, founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a regular member in autumn 1956.
In the following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), was elected vice-chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He had entered this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been involved in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rockets (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rockets for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first started on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh a total of 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in 1959 began in the Błūdów desert flight test with the two-stage RM-2 rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another level of development should be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used to monitor altitudes.
In 1962, however, further development was introduced.
A successor of the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket developed in the years 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of rockets (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed, which differ in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B above 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C above 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight height was 37 km at all three types.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Institute of Aviation, the first of which started its flight test in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a useful load of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
Then the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
The accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed two years later by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites under the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became a second intercosmonaut, after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the law on non-profit works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court raised the law on non-profit works.
This decision called for a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to consider the problem once from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unscrupulous financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages) there are price tensions.
In this sense, there is a state in which the manufacturer is trying to survive by importing cheap goods into economic competition by "substituting" competition, thereby increasing its market share and increasing its profits.
To a large extent, this means for most companies to sell their production abroad or to buy in favour of it, or to give up their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital is not a social responsibility and thus does not bear any responsibility for its unemployment, public expenditure is necessarily increasing.
This situation is further strengthened by the fact that the employers are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus replace the overall economic and social damage they cause.
This situation is generally known so that concrete statistics in this place are superfluous.
The disproportionate practice of private capital in individual economies creates a situation in which governments are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population regardless of the social consequences to private capital.
This is particularly reflected in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to compel the own population to accept the dictatorship of private capital, particularly in the wage sector.
This is one of the economic pressures of long-term unemployment, one of which is the reduction of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as growing differences between arm and rich.
In Germany, there have been public food supplies for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work for a few years.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such a low wage that the State must raise their income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal has also been detected in the case of auxiliary forces employed in the German Bundestag.
The savings measures of virtually all EU countries will no doubt go beyond the same state in which people are forced to migrate (as in the 19th century), or to work for a hunger wage on the edge of society, hoping that private investment will eventually flow to the country.
Here, of course, the question arises where this capital comes from.
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty moves from one country to another; or capital remains the same because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or Africa employees work for a fraction of European wages.
This is about Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claimed to be beyond doubt that the State should not take part in its own economy and that the plan economy leads to economic catastrophe.
The private capital is closely linked to its position that the State may not intervene in the economy.
However, we must ask ourselves whether private capital does not influence politics and thus affect the entire state in its own selfish sense or even influence it.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence for this is the existence of a practically omnipotent and modern lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual advantage, legislation, in which virtually everything is necessary, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is that a Ministry of State has no private finance, close to industry-based law firms, with the drafting of bills.
These draft laws are then adopted on the Bundestag.
All violence then goes no further than the people, how it announces the Western constitutions, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
The liberal democracies are now rapidly entering a situation, as Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompeii': "The state has long been understood in the collapse, and the offices have been occupied with violence.
Against butter money, by illegal distortion of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption was unstoppable, and the people went with already purchased votes to vote" ... "People with characters did not complain to officials, so that the state had no consulate for eight months as a result of this descent" ... "I really began to say that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a single rule, and that a strong man had to be elected"... Appian thought of Pompeii, but then the strong man was Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy by the sole rule.
As it turns out, today’s society is based, as in the ancient past, on the inadvertent preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to the whole of society’s interests.
From its nature, private capital is not in a position to recognise and implement the advantage for the whole society.
The result, as it is today, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites who do not try in vain to reform downhill.
We must therefore look for the cause of fascism and communism in the disproportionate liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's point of view, the decline of this regime in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain break in which the next round is already drawing off.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that today's elites face the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters of which we are witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the older and newer history, completely ignored.
The repeal of the law on non-profit works is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to search for ways to push the social level of the population below.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the State's participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: The labor of Chaos.
"...that nothing comes from violence, or could ever arise" sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain: "...so that we do not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, there was no war," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a number of reactions.
They stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defence, while they call the Palestinians terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, argue with the Israeli state's racism, with the genocide committed to the Palestinian Arabs and call the State Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write in this place about who is in these constant waves of the death of the guilty and who is the victim; finally, the inhabitants of Israel today, including the self-government areas, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence themselves.
I am going to open the reader's view behind the scenes, the view of who are the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spot country in the Middle East above all.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and from my own understanding of who or what group of people has a significant influence on the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every age, we can make Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves that determined their steps autonomously, or whether there was anyone behind their throne who was leading their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must agree that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power derived from it has not arisen within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is a special one that could be described as the head of the Kraków (I do not know if anyone else is on them, but I do not exclude this) - the Rothschilds.
Many are not written about them.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased by the Rothschilds in the 1990s in order to prevent the connection of their name to high criminal acts, in whose background the strengthening of their power, the increase of their wealth or both stood.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they wage wars or rely on them (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after which the storm of Gaddafis remained only four, while Russia subjugated its central bank of the Russian government in the meantime).
Anyone who tried to confront this family had to pay for it with life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue his own (public) bank notes during the Civil War and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own bank notes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; Senator Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to accuse the FED for the outbreak of the global economic crisis in 1929.
The global power lists of Rothschilds led in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan for the extermination of three world wars by Albert Pik, a freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of consciousness.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchist states of Europe, in particular the colonial rule of the United Kingdom, and the third war was intended to reduce the world population to about 0.5-1 billion people (a number of such people would provide for their convenience and luxury and would not even consume so many resources), create a universal religion (Ecumenism here is nothing more than the precedent) and ultimately lead to the takeover of absolute power.
The method with which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is the trigger of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao - order of chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the EDF, so that crises like those triggered by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After they were able to trigger the First World War in Sarajevo by the murder of the Habsburg Throne Ferdinand, they destroyed the Russian Empire by the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended with the sudden, military and economic unwarranted capitalisation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Zarennia), and the resolution of the Central European Power of Austria-Hungary took place.
In order to make the Second World War easier, the Bankers allowed politics to create a latent conflict situation by putting Germany on huge war repairs, creating the prerequisites of poor masses, so that they had to undermine the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader who offered the debtors with easy solutions; another factor was the creation of the country of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to assume the function of a fifth column and also accepted to facilitate the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, where a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as much as possible in the historic territory of Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (back to Zion).
The said Balfour declaration created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews from Palestine to Palestine; it was the first clash with the indigenous Arab population.
Terrorist attacks were on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was released from the chain, which the international bankers had initially held, or whether everything was planned, is only difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war repairs against Germany prepared the ground for the Second World War, the calling of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focus for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in exposing this war, the Jewish people will be like the victims of World War II in the front line, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (one thinks only of how the people were divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, at the beginning of which the souls of the individual and their striving for global power stood?
There is a need to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership here, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, exclusively their own candidates, make a choice.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascismist, a politician loyal to the international banks, who is doing everything to get rid of a war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan) could quickly expand to a global conflict, and where Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide road of Hormus, over 20% of global oil supply could result in a global economic destruction.
In what light are the words of David Rockefellers from 1994: "The only thing we need is an all-embracing crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order."
In her presentation, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financiers.
A world in which every newborn is implanted a chip at birth to subjected this being to total control.
"And it makes the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves all give a sign to their right hand or to their foreheads that no one can buy or sell, because he has the sign, namely the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom. Whoever has understanding, the number of the beast is greater than it.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six."
The film Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrator Islamic students occupied the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they called for the release of the ruined Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution to the United States, who had held the patronage over his regime for decades.
For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - she could not afford to throw the chess overboard, as this would have seriously damaged the trust of her allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was not able to carry out the liberation of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a difficult blow for the calling of the United States, and the subsequent Fiasko, during the violent attempt to free the soul, only made things worse.
The diplomats captured were finally released after 444 days of negotiations by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages called home a wave of solidarity as well as anti-Iranian moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan at the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that protected the USA a small partial victory.
Immediately before the message was put in place, six ambassadors fled.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees out of Iran, helping them with an extravagance of their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports as members of a film staff who allegedly visited in the country of Drehorte for a science fiction film.
Combination of the genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
In order to make the drawing credible, articles on this film project appeared in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks Film is a special combination of several film genres.
On one side he is a realistic polithriller, but also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful housepiece such as the Ocean's eleven film.
As a result, the levels of mood change in the film - on the one hand, the documentaries from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and even in the film version of the same situations there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passes from Hollywood, which are ironically and easily overestimated.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the discussion table, on the office flow, on the phone...
With this film, Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable relaunch of his career.
From a playful actor, he has become a respected director, and as an actor, he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third play film after Crimea No children's game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City without Gnade (2010).
At the same time, it's affleck's first film that doesn't play in the director's home Boston.
The sense of the local atmosphere was one of the features that removed the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood.
However, affleck also proves this spirit in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the introductory sequence of the destruction of the message is very impressive in its bulwark, yet it conveys the feeling of confusion and unforeseeableness, which occurs when the story moves somewhere.
A similar effect is achieved by defluck with his team also in fictional scenes (the false film staff on a bassar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to contend with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the film's sense.
With the few, however, he works quite successfully, sometimes helping the reality - which then does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at Tehran airport is eliminated by a telephone call in America, or even the persecution hunt on the runway, seem to be somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its all too wide range, which is required by the necessity to show too much in action to too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures would have earned more space, and thus they are far from alone in the film.
Afflecks film thus loses some power. It is a film that can be pursued with a certain interest, and in doing so, the design and the retro-style that is remembered by a thriller from the 1970s.
However, enthusiasm only stirs up difficulties.
However, as a reminder of a way to this day of life history and as evidence of how the ideas of the omnipotent and omnipotent secret services are exceeded, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for blowing air balloons, bananas and circuses
This year, the server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which calls for an annual survey of the most absurd bank charges, has decided to organise the competition "the most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"This idea led us to the most recent plan by the EU to introduce a 40% women's share in the management of large European companies," said Patrick Nader, who is taking care of the organisation of this survey, compared to the newspaper Pravo.
For example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonization of the rate of insurance for men and women is found among the nominated absurdities.
To this end, women enjoy life insurance as they objectively pose a lower risk to insurance companies.
"More incredible revenues from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place by the end of February 2013", Nader said.
The controversial EU regulations include, among other things, the binding mixing of bioethanol into fuels which are naturally harmful, the further ban on the reliable mercury thermometer, only because it contains a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of chickens, which has been significantly more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism also raised the actual ban on the use of the term "butterufstrich" or the ban on the sale of conventional glaucoma.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU Council often decides under pressure from this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose claims in Brussels are usually represented by one or more Member States (for example, Czech Republic is currently trying to comply with the claims of Czech banks with veto-drinking).
Lobby's interest was also that bananas of the highest commercial class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and should not have "crime anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it only harmonises the uniform national standards that would impede trade.
The EU's standards on fruit and vegetables have already been highlighted by the EU against the resistance of some countries, pointing out that the previous directives would lead to food loss.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which, according to air balloons, must be provided when selling, indicating that children under eight years of age are not allowed to blow up the air balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU relied on an American study, which, according to Air Balloons, is the leading cause of the death of children.
A similar restriction is already applicable to children up to 14 years of age when using annual market rates.
Curious inputs are also available at home
It is also quite absurd that a directive which concerns European officials themselves - anyone who assumes an official role in the EU must not use the name of Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the Greek theme and instead of FYROM (former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server nominated, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Fair, in addition to the so-called absurdities, the EU regulation on the extent of food supplies in the field of a Member State.
The EU thus established the highest level of food supplies, which could be found on the day of our EU accession in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then exceeds, for example, the fixed volume for mushroom cans, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of providing funding for applications for funding.
These ideas came, not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We're embarrassed that we don't have a sea.
We will apply for a refund from the EU," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the cereals were very high and the state stocks were overcrowded due to the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to the Palace.
Finally, the European Commission opposed the Czech Republic to organising an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries which do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for funding funds has been offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel Némec (US-DEU), in particular it should be a means of raising funding applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre Regulations are the exception
However, regulations in the Member States are easily criticised by the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also to improve the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole, in the opinion of some experts.
A more serious problem is, in the opinion of these experts, the EU funding for projects, which have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which has been forced into the budgetary negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also call for the fact that, like other Member States in Brussels, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to use specific designations of traditional products and not always win this fight.
However, after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the term "Olomucké vorzóky", the Inland Room (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition returned to us until the 19th century, had to be renamed "Tuzemák".
The term "rum" must only be used for products of sugar cane distillate, not for products of sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipan or the parschinken also includes the Karlsbad Zwieback, Carpfen from Pohorèlice and Treboň, or the Saazar Hoppen.
With an EU brand, the Pardubicer Lebkuchen or the Horizer Rolls can breast-feed.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Mr Senator, how do you get the idea of running for the President's office?
I'm not talking about being a senator or a president.
If everything in our country would work without problems, I would never run anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been spitting out for 20 years, how the thief goes around freely, while people are being increased in taxes and age.
I didn't have ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something that I don't like, then I try to propose a solution to change this.
And since I'm over 40, and I'm independent and partial, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a senator or the president.
In the Senate you made it and then made yourself on the way to the castle.
That's why you don't turn your voters back?
I've been telling myself all along that I'm going to take the fight around the castle after the Senate elections.
Later, I specified this and said that I would run for the office of the President if I were elected senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as a people in the button and in front of the TV show, but that everyone who wants to make a change.
To that end, the media who want to rob one of the honour and who pervert the freedom of the word with freedom.
About me, for example, it was claimed that I would beat journalists or that I was a consultant by Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You have taken the fight against the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with a backlog of assets of over 20 million crowns.
To that end, you need to change laws.
As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have used myself to keep the tour guide free of charge, and this could be put through.
The problem is small-scale policy - when someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only keeps the population on.
As an independent party, I have a far greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country without any sleighting or partying.
Do you see yourself as a human being in politics rather than on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me on the left.
For me, this right-link thinking is completely irrelevant.
It's important to me that we move on.
I don't care if anyone belongs to the left or the right warehouse; I want to connect the people.
I always publicly support every good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don't like it when someone calls you populists.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And that's what you want to get closer to.
This is why it can be called populism, but all the proposals I have spoken about already work in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, only words of strike remain.
And so you don't go far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people for a long time, you will succeed, for example, in carrying out the material and criminal liability?
I don't have any other options.
Politicians, journalists and the public to convince and try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these objectives.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to ask the Presidents of the European Parliament to live on television to legalise the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and civil lawyers.
And the accused should then say, "Why do they deny this?"
A strong personality that points to faults can exert pressure on the political scene.
Just take the President's direct choice, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work out, then I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I alone do not achieve anything; that is why I have talked to several well-known persons about whether they do not want to run for the Senate.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who refused to work because of overwork.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered the fraud in trade with light heating oil.
My candidacy started with the assumption that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of the electors have not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone have mostly elected representatives of the institution.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will only be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct election of mayors and district heads.
Do you think about establishing a own party?
I have not yet thought about this because I have no time to review the past of any potential party member, and I do not even have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign yet; only 20,000 CZK are on my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about asset statements, how do you look?
My private assets are estimated at CZK 60 million.
In Prague I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Skodu Superb worth about a million. And then I have a few million on the account.
The Aston Martin was also a childish dream - James Bond always liked me as he drove in the car, was gallant to women and fought evil at the same time.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have 60 million assets and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest in your own money.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make a debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't generate much interest.
And I am not obliged to fight the campaign from my own resources.
The costs for the campaign are essentially covered by my content as a senator.
But I couldn't live on my own from the senator's content; for example, I couldn't fund the English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your income?
Didn't you say you're going to go back to these activities?
But this does not relate to the amount of the value.
As promised, I have partially returned my activities.
For example, my representative in the spring becomes the manager of the travel office.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that's still the case.
However, as President, I would like to set up my business.
You will find the full conversation in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not only in the head - for example of the caves and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "Yes, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder what we need a bookshop for today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes voluntarily into one of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenen, a hardly visiting sleeping town in front of the Rotterdam Towers, is a non-recordable holder.
The 80,000-population community shows the lowest rate of education in the entire Netherlands.
In order to counter this foolish situation, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to build up the seven fictitious bridges on the euro banknotes as well-painted concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city's fathers recognized that there was only one way to make statistics master: a library had to be here!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam Architectural Office MVRDV, master of the stunning bar charts and producer of funny, yes often cynic buildings, took the matter with normal comfort and appeared to the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under arm and a border in the face.
And while the jury was still suspected of looking around and sweating with the axles, the fresh Maas gathered his read-up coarse of the size to a pyramid and ended his actionist underwalled speech with the words: "Dear City Community!"
So this is my proposal for the Bücherberg of Spijkennies, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro expensive mountain is shot up.
It is part of a revitalization project, including underground garage, supermarket, post and a few adjacent residential and rowing houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the faceless small city resorts, which so far no longer had to offer as a post-modern pedestrian zone and an unmatched ugly hall, behind which white facades would be inclined to suppose a dairy factory to be a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
Above all, however, Spijkenen now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Path to the Book
The first impression: Büchereldorado under cage locks.
Although there is a lift that leads through the mountain massif, the true room and reading delights are found when the topography is levelled.
The glassed interior is bright and clear, the burned clay floors and the elegant street ladders speak unmistakably the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You already have a look at parkbank, dog and football boys and girls.
And everywhere, books, books.
"Normally, the rules of books are located along the facade, and in the middle there is a large, dark space, which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have put the classic room configuration on our head and pushed the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the Bücherberg is well used: in the middle of offices, Internet libraries, chess clubs, environmental center and home technology centres.
A special pleasure is the black bookstore rules, which are sometimes wall coverings, sometimes weaving, sometimes climbing countries.
Optics, bites and smells are foreign.
Even embedded architects and construction engineers will shake the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the City Municipality of Spijkennies, at the request of the standard.
And so, in a Friesland farming operation one day, we have been pumped into an appropriate waste product from agriculture.
For many years it has been used in the Netherlands in plant houses and in fields a millimetre of plastic wool as a source material.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile holds, two seasons, then it is ripe for the sperm powder.
For the library, the wool was pressed - for the first time in these quantities - to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (CLP) is dyed into a dark, homogeneous, loadable material that smells a bit to new cars and a bit to sports shoes.
After 105 steps one is reached at the summit.
At the end of the almost 500 meters long hiking trip, the literature café is rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and planted ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but especially for the correct humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations of cash with the condition that it can be returned if needed by the donor.
"You wouldn't believe it, but in spite of the many glass surfaces, this house is a preview project in ecology," Trouborst says.
It is heated and cooled with soil heat.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass storm, the sun itself seems only short in sunny days.
The broad wooden strips, which stand either on the glass facade, serve as an estimate and capture a large part of the sun's radiation.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The rest perform full automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sculptor from the IT sector, was already waiting for the way to the new bookstore.
Lisette Verhaig was there, too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who calls the Bookenberg even as the "longest-overdue soul".
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to contribute a book from his personal stock.
This is the first time the optical gaps in the uncompleted library - currently 70,000 pieces - are to be filled.
The concept has gone up.
The regulars are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-hearted library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for the earth.
This has resulted in the success of MVRDV of the Royal Discipline, which is called the Fachjargon Identification Foundation.
Spijkenen has written literature history.
So young and unimaginable she may be.
This is finally a point of approach for identity.
Szabo: "Germans need to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine in the vote.
According to Stephen Szabo, experts for US-European relations, Berlin is balanced on a narrow diplomatic level.
German Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had first signaled that it would vote against the request for an observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
But then Berlin was involved.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, due to its special relationship with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I believe it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, being too critical of Israel.
During the revolt in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote when it was intended to establish a restricted flight zone.
This was finally implemented by NATO.
Does Germany find it difficult to make a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is just turning its foreign policy away from a policy managed by the United States to a German foreign policy.
It is difficult to say that Europeans do not have coherent and uniform policies.
Thus, the Germans are located between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still in their role, but they are on the way to a "normaler" foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as France or the United Kingdom.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean, specifically from a German point of view?
It shows willingness to address positions that are independent of those of the US or European partners in national interests.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and relations to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain degree different from those of the other large powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
For one thing, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
That is why it is necessary to be careful not to stumble the public, but also the elite, in the Arab countries.
It plays a role anyway.
But I would also not want to put too much weight on it, which is not a completely unilateral relationship.
But it plays an important role in German discussions anyway.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by having included in important decisions of the vote, for example in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic breach as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will do so with a certain respect.
Because it does signal that it is taken seriously as an international player and its interests must be considered.
There are various opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the other hand, the United States has made clear a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama has a lot of understanding for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position.
I believe that the real differences in opinion are not as big as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so excited about Netanyahu's politics.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can't be part of a wider line and they have to drive things out of their own position instead.
They're doing this with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take a leading role in the future to push Europe into a European position.
This is, of course, not simply for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel.
It's always been a sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany itself see itself as an important international player - want to take on a major role at all?
Or does Germany still have a difficult leadership role?
Germany is still not accustomed to this, it is still unacceptable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a larger role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany assumes a greater role, various anti-German feelings will be released.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Thus Germany is seen in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be sensitive to different neighbors and opinions and this is not easy.
Now the influence of the United States in European politics is constantly decreasing, but at the moment the EU does not fill this vacuum, who else is there?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unacceptable to them, and it makes them a lot more unpopular - c'est la vii!

"Market protection" in China: If Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
A name registered in China, however, is hidden, which has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
However, it enjoys as long protection as the actual nominees do not complain.
And even then it's not clear if they get right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at the office of Taylor Wessing, who specializes in rights violations in Fernost.
Every week there's a new case on my desk.
The successors already have a few additional letters so they can sign up for their brands.
So from Gucci it's just Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can sign in Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, for example, by the sports articles manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with trademark entries in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company there protected the brand Zegna DF Puma, an art name that also served in the fashion of Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese world champions are in copying and in damaged spiritual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey shops that almost exclusively sell counterfeits.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different: on behalf of his clients, it is assumed that Chinese companies from the brand office will be given the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is "Bang Dakuan".
That's what women are meant to be like when they're having a lot of men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"That's harmful business, you have to fight it," Pattloch asks.
"The brand is watered, the setting alone disappears, the image damage is huge."
The financial expenditure and the process costs of the sectors concerned go to millions, especially in the case of expensive ad hoc products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China is the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing market of 15 billion euros per year.
However, deletions of double entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can be extended, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports on cases in which the Court of Justice dismissed the complaint because after the long term the name in question became "marktreality".
If the plaintiff has Pech, he has to pay the plagiarism even because he violated his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle reigns here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction engine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump builder Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese can still use a symbol similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the dispute was broken, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against Nahammer from Hong Kong and Singapore, who let the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO brand name in Beijing, however, adds that in 2010 there was a lack of staff and space equipment.
Last year, however, one was returned to normal from the "notification of normal work".
Thus, the unprocessed opposition procedure was reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, 81,500 objections to release are still pending in the office.
Dealing with it costs a lot
As often as in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection were submitted to the CTMO, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time, China has started the list of new notifications around the world, the Authority will inform.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan was charged.
Simply this means that each application costs an average of 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, it costs a lot, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting a Chinese plagiarism.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that their illegal manufacture of simulated power vehicles was lifted.
However, the Nachhamer continued to secure Chinese rights at the Freudenberg brand.
You have missed this because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The name CTMO showed the opposition of the Munichi.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg got right, but the opposition continues to fight today.
You have to be careful.
The case is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be mentioned, the company archive has had to go through hundreds of years of old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg, on the other hand, offered a "high six-star euro amount" for settlement.
"Dranan you see how much we value it," Wentzler says.
The dangers in Fernost threaten even to return to Europe.
That's when Imitators secure unprotected brands there.
Thus a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has given up the Group for the longest time, yet it was able to reject registration.
"You have to be careful," Wentzler says.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies be very careful in dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but the foreigners should "all that is of any value to protect them also in China", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can become much more expensive than registration.
In fact: If Freudenberg is subject to the last act of his brand drama, then it is likely that the opposite party should pay license fees for its own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we are forced out of the market in the segment.
World Day: Stamps, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi - and Swaziland are happy about it.
The history of a connection that exceeds far more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all, the stamps are: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies' pumps and men's slippers are looking for the tack on the parking floor, they'll find it fast.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly shudder - old, bass, tenor and soprano - strain, disturb and persecute themselves.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, has it almost out of his fabric shoes when he brings her together with his embarrassing wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the musiccram of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, Chor Imbongi tries a new song.
The fifty singers and singers, between 23 and 69 years of age, came from the human geneticist to the household man.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir voice has a different text and this is also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self-help
There are about 34 million HIV-infected worldwide, which estimates Unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 AIDS victims live.
More than 40 per cent of the population are currently HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS cows in the village of Esitnije, the Association Voices for Africa found Paten in Germany.
70 of them attend a further school.
For 15 or 20 Euros a month you can take on a physique.
It guarantees the child's school money, school uniforms and a hot meal daily in the Gogo center.
Imbongi means Zulu storyteller or also praiser.
The Bantus language can speak fluently in this room, but no one can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing in this foreign soft language and brings it back to where it originally came from: in South Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esiteni, which depends on the voice of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2000 people live there, some still in simple leather and straw hats, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents anymore because they are exposed to the HI virus.
In Esiteni, it appears in small, where whole Swaziland is sick: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
Men's skin cuts, which prove to reduce the risk of inflammation by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus in themselves, with 30 deaths in the middle of it is no rareness.
On a joint African trip in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but especially the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, where there was not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
You don't have a chance in a poor country without a school leave.
In the beginning, it was still the private commitment of individuals to send a few euros a year a child to school and to allow him a warm meal a day.
However, a year later, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association, which has been working almost professionally around the AIDS waves in Esitni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI includes syphilis, Chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Filzlouse and herbs are among the parasitic STI.
Who are the main groups?
Syphilis and tripper are especially common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four of the five Syphilis cases reported in Germany will be transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In the heterosexual adults, Chlamyden infections, Trichomonads, Candidose (Pilz), Tripper and Human Pappylomavir are often sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in this country - however: Around 20 percent of HIV infections occur in this group.
In adolescents Chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently than in other population groups.
After European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In these countries, human papillomaviruses are also common in young people.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to reporting.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute of Diseases in 2001, the number of syphilis infections was more than doubled to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause joint pains in the genital area, complaints of urine, rash, abdominal pain, and blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unknown.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of a bite, but do not offer a 100% protection.
For, in part, the problem of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through fungal infections and close contact with the body.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations especially in frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosis can heal most STI and avoid consequences.
Because of the responsibilities, donations, and not least the gap that the choir is experiencing throughout Germany, some come together.
"In total, we have already sent around 20 000 euros to Esiteni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and powerful woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also takes care of the well-being of the cows, with one of the great mothers.
The Gogos, as the old women are called Zulu, are the support of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 cows with them, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children appear on time every day in their uniforms for school.
Anyone who has no one else comes to the shelter in Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association as well as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has launched a nearby school, built two chicken houses and organized PSI together with the American health organization, that many in the village have made a HIV test.
This is not self-evident, because so obviously the disease is also throughout the country, it is the best thing to do.
A king with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
In fact, it's strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Schwarzafrikas, King Mswati III., is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Let's look at democracy instead.
Among other things, this state-sanctioned life-form is also responsible for the spread of HI virus in the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms are available at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Culture is another - flash to flash."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi-Chor travels all two, three years together through South Africa and sings songs full of vigour, spirit of struggle, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many know at the southern tip of the Black continent from the times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings excitement and joy, but has already brought down some cruel border soldiers a few tears.
The trip always leads to Esitni, where the singers visit their father’s children.
Even if you hardly find the small village on land maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is more known than.
"Go to Esiteni, there's the light," people say there.
And when you return the 8733 kilometres of air line to Heidelberg, to the steaming singers in the sample room on the Bergheim Street, you will see it also bright.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The probe messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US Space Agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although the sun is next, there is also frozen water, as from three studies published in the "Science" magazine on Thursday.
The probe messenger has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanent region of the planet’s shadow.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or perhaps also asteroids that are stuck on the Mercury.
No one connects the foundation of ice but with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger Sonde, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have been reached in other areas of the solar system.
Not noticed by the earth’s citizens are probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix to explore the depths of the world.
From time to time, they send pictures to Earth: Small holes in endless widths.
The picture comes from a camera that German researchers have developed from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the twin planet Ceres.
As Pluto, who crosses the sun behind Neptune, Ceres, after the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006, is not a "Planet".
This picture of an infrared capture of the Spitzer Telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: the oldest stars are to be identified as blue points, harder to identify are the pink "newborn" in the star ring hall.
This star-shaped region - by scientists called unromantic W5 - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the star image Cassiopeia, in a distance of 6500 light years.
This shimmering glare of a dying star has captured the peak telescope of the NASA.
The Donut-shaped ring is made up of material that exacerbated the star in the process of death.
In the huge trifid fog, 5400 light years away from the earth, new stars come from gas and dust.
The peak telescope of the NASA shot this photo of the galactic womb.
The Pleiades star cap, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors get better.
Like a red age, the Helix Nebel looks at this infrared photo against the viewer.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius star picture.
Its similarity to an earthly continent introduced the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photos provides the spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be recorded in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer Telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How these were created is one of the great puzzles of astronomy.
Perhaps they are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared undetected 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and strongest recordings of the Hubble Telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on coloring, photographs of spiral galaxies will be true works of art.
The recording published by the European Southern Guard shows Trifid Nebula in the constellation Schütze, which is thousands of light years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (tried, divided), as dark dust strips divide the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
In the star picture, snakes have photographed the pre-supposition of a cosmic carabulage: 400 million light years away from the earth, the cores of two melting galaxies are growing together and will inevitably collapsing together.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
For those who do not have the technical abbreviations, it may be called the Southern Fire Wheel at its peak.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows an excerpt from the irisnebel in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-year fog consists of dust grains, which are 10 to 100 times smaller than normal domestic dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, took up the space telescope Hubble for the NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy is known as the scientist UGC 1810.
There is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The stars always produce new young stars.
These star clouds, connected with the Rosette Nebel, are also emerging new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this brilliant galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, but only gas.
Researchers assume that he was born shortly after the urn when the universe was mainly found hydrogen.
Our insights into all: The most important telescopes
The telescope was to be invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - before Galileo Galileo used it to observe stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have been increasingly large - and the insights they provide have become deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest remotest tube.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Big Binocular Telescope stands.
It lets look into all over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior life of the Grand Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Islands of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone reaches 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
However, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the favourable construction: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly Telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
Its speciality: the high amount of light.
This is enough - despite relatively low mirror diameter - to the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to all according to extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
The "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) can help any computer owner by providing computing.
Look at the Observatory of the European Star War (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which makes all the honors to his name.
With its four mirrors, the remote tube can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is intended to contain 42 meters - and to be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, with images, it is early 2018 to be calculated.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea observatory, which is next to them with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF in the sky.
On the Mauna Kea, too, a new huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of 30 meters.
Here it is on an illustration.
However, the world's most important impressions from all provide the space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990 it has already delivered pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been looking for extrasolar planets - mainly those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, the NASA announced that 1235 planet candidates have been identified since the start of the mission.
In the picture, the last initial preparations at the space telescope Kepler are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched on board an Ariane5 rocket in early 2018.
The primary level of the world's infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It should look for light from the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists assume that there is ice at the South Pole of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as the messenger is far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on the Mercury.
The Messenger probe launched in 2004 – the first to cross the Mercury – now scientists have certainty.
Drinking butter daily - and become 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblical age.
There's even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblical age.
There's even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch-Geberg is wild-mantic.
The small bus flows across the curved road, past densely forested hills, flowing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you were in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border to Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here the Caucasian group of the Italians lives, of which it is not very well known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Asian and is very long-lasting.
The end station is Lerik.
The small town is easy with too vast architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the approach of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers, it takes eight hours, because the road is only one - way.
The tangible wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the right to tourist attraction.
"Baku was celebrated in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva says.
She is the director of the Museum for Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the life of about eight dozen Italians from the area is documented, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, a child is still born
But the controversial star of the museum is the Schafhirte Şírali Müslümov, who is to become 168 years old.
There is, however, no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented person who was 122 years old, Müslümov's age appears to be highly questionable.
"He was born here in 1805 in the region, in 1973 he died," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136, he was supposed to have witnessed a daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov count for a few decades at his age?
But Rembrandt Scholz, an senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also been one of the high events in Central Asia.
"In some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, many highly respected people are also present," says Scholz, "and in Sardinia there are very many very old men".
However, due to lack of documents, there was no scientific evidence of age, especially the lack of a personal record.
Every day definitely fried butter
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik often reach a Bible age.
Currently, there are 20 people over 100 years of age.
So why do so many high-ends live here in the south?
The Asian guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Italians.
On the other hand, the museum director Fatulayeva believes that there is food.
But that calculated the calorie-rich cost of the talyses should be so healthy that meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of them drink a glass of powdered butter daily, from a scientific point of view, is not even plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that people keep young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With her 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
It sits on the ground with a butter cup that rolls it uncomfortably.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, both are the oldest parents.
Two little kids are going around, too.
In the kitchen you prepare the guests tea, which is served in the typical, kitchen-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfect in row and piece, under her head she hides long, dark blond teeth, which her son proudly reveals before us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so they never went off and kept their color.
"I've never used Shampoo," Mirzayeva says.
Monthly Interest Enough for Life
She has always only eaten what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, herbs.
For the rest of my life, I haven't bought food in the supermarket for a single time.
Then she tells her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst in the time after World War II.
But everything got better than the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the noise.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
By 2003 he was in power, later took over his son Ilham the miner.
There's no point at all under Azerbaijan's old.
230 Manat (like the same sum in euro), Mirzayeva receives monthly as an interest, for domestic conditions an amount from which you can live well.
And maybe Mirzayeva's son is right for the longest time: "The old enjoy our culture's high regard."
They live in the middle of the big family, are loved, cared for, and are happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalizing events in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with the Sharia as a basis is strongly contested.
The Egyptian President did not spare Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he may succeed, is in my charge before the people and before God," he said in state television.
His speech was directed to the whole people, but especially to the Christian leaders, the Liberals, the distinguished Muslims and secularists.
Because they all, so far without hope, are fighting in a confusing opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God at the Nile of the graces of the mighty Muslim brotherhood.
He said, as Mohammed Mursi said, almost apologizing, temporarily cut the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his powers to "rescue the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who wears a doctoral title at the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, about which the Egyptians are themselves, the world is not quite clear.
Whether the application prefers to have a dark theme.
In fact, the 234 articles that were staged by the Islamic-dominated 100-headed constitutional assembly as part of a nightly, 15-hour parforceritis are of concern.
As in previous constitutions, it is also said in the draft that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
That was and is the subject of interpretation, and there is a fear that Islamists will use the smug formulation and the corresponding legal space for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
At least a new article is added: in all matters relating to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University must be drawn up, the most important Islamic institution of the country with great radiation in all Sunni Islam.
This does not have to be, but it can mean that spirituality oversees the law, which would de facto lead to the dissipation of the judiciary.
Much in the draft Constitution is a matter of interpretation
It is also problematic: civil justice should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's rule to suppress opposition.
After the defeat of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians sat in military custody.
The state should also, as it stands in the draft, "the true being of the Egyptian family" protects "and promotes their morals and their values".
This is so legally formulated that state institutions can control even the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In Putuxt, this means nothing but censorship.
No article, on the other hand, expressly states the equality of men and women.
To this end, another prophet, Mohammed, and his messengers, are forbidden to speak ill of or insult.
But what is an insult and how it is to be treated remains unclear.
Also dubiously encourages the formulation that the "suffering of people" is prohibited.
Is there a character of the president or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
As much as in the draft, the Mursi is signed and, according to its words, the Egyptians will be presented to the national vote "very soon".
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming against the power of the Islamists for weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual entrance on Friday at Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to bring the Charter into effect before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will be victorious," said Hamdin Sabbai, third-stakeholder of the presidential elections.
Peace Nobel Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Authority, Mohamed El-Baradei, explained that the draft constitution belongs to "the Müllberg of History".
Through short notice service Twitter, he visited the annexer Mursis to want to lead a "putsch against democracy".
"When he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and crush him," said opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not healed," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim brotherhood, on the other hand, became a counter-test, but not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists took part in this and cried out: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
They asked Mursi: "Cleaner of the land!" and they said: "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle about the height of the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which all its beginnings took place, would have claimed civil war conditions.
The Mursis followers obviously did not want to risk it.
The Muslim brothers explained that both the opponents of the draft Constitution and the supporters had spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide on the election course in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word of human rights doesn't even happen"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious about this forced constitutional process, which would have gone until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison under Mubarak or in court.
Not because he would share their view of the world, but because human rights are inseparable for him.
He was tortured, convicted, imprisoned for that.
"And now the word of human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complained in the discussion with the "World on Sunday".
Mursi's extension of power to all three State violences allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are flagrant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto puts them out of power," lamented Saeda.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels alone, also from the international community, who considers the ideological struggle at the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be a joke.
A demonstration on Tahrir warns: "You give a monster you can't control anymore."
Fishing from Norway: Is this the most devastating fish in the world?
The five million Norwegians enjoy one of the highest standards of life - not only in Europe, but throughout the world.
Could the country's success secret have something to do with the local appetite on pretty sloppy fish?
You take a selection of too many cheese varieties.
They are placed in the middle of a pile of dirty, damp sports clothes.
And hold her there for a week.
So close is the smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's great delicates.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes - and this harsh smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is a salt-stained forage that - depending on how much you would like to smell its fish - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norway flows to a festival here in Fagernes, which, now, is dedicated to a really great speciality.
"You eat it raw and then wash it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire department, but also organizes the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk-General".
Around us people consume small fish cubes and take large amounts of alcohol to themselves.
"Men like the Aquavit more than the fish," says Havard.
The spirit can suppress the smell.
I'll take a few hippies.
If you avoid bringing the fish near the nose, it's not bad - like Sushi, who has a quite long bus ride behind him.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, far poorer Norwegian epoch, when there were no refrigerations yet and fish was drunk in autumn in air-resistant saltwater fibers.
In the deepest winter, he was removed after long fermentation and, no doubt, consumed with alcohol-derived senses.
Even before a generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and mainly moved to the United States in search of work.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, angeled by a flourishing labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, which has not long been far richer than Norway, immigrants flow.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, although also a stricter part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the most expensive courts to buy here.
But, actually, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a proud 10 Euro.
Norway doesn't often get into the world press, and most people don't seem to mind.
Here, you still hate to call Anders Breivik by name - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it refers only to the "Event of 22 July".
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal killings.
The main responsibility for the present wealth of Norway has been the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our cellarr, who distributes round tablets with raffial fish and with her long blonde hair and the striking blue eyes the Nordic ideal.
We are a - as you say - careful people.
Her English is just like most people here are homeless.
We're not very polite, we don't like pralery.
Norway has been very careful with its oil wealth - a large part of its industry income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years to the global economic crisis, everyone threw money around which they did not own, Norway firmly closed its stock exchange.
"If we can ride in the winter skiing and walk in the summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And of course eat rakfish," she adds with uncomplicated laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand for another court - I have enough of Rakfisk.
Such an elch-citizen is in any case something else.
But in the evening, the steak fish is back on the food plan.
The hotel, where I'm staying, is one of several venues that organize a rakfisk dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging sense of smell - fish.
There is a live TV switch to a showmaster dressed in fly, surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What number do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You laugh and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict dunes of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico's future president Enrique Pena Nieto prepares for his entry to office, Will Grant of the BBC analyzes the challenges he faces and the mixed feelings of his people.
Current traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even in better days, this is a always-closed city, but on Monday a steel ring was built that shuts down several important traffic routes into the capital and provides the streets for chaos.
The aim, however, was not to disrupt pendants on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential bond and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a complex task.
Under the separate government, Felipe Calderons has been able to prove itself economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama early this week at the Oval Office.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this objective.
Before he went up with the U.S. president, Pena Nieto was the governor of his home country of Mexico.
In this densely populated, extensive part of the country surrounding the capital, the opinions on the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
For example, in the remote small town of Valle del Bravo you can remember him.
Residents of the holiday resort write to him the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, one can drive on one of the highways that had Pena Nieto built and represent a great improvement towards the fragile, helpful roads that once existed here.
Platets with its name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect real and constant changes from him," said his friend and political associate Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as congressman for the party Pena Nietos.
In particular, as regards security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was dissolved in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that the party, after 12 years outside Los Pino's presidential palace, places great expectations on Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the props of the opposition, which the new president lacks, and he rejects.
He was a very direct man, very committed and had great plans for the country.
He was an excellent stateman, but above all he was also someone who could listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under road crossings and in many respects represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was activated to combat drug trafficking in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spot of Brachland near a large muzzle ponie, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left alone in the last two years.
During the time of Governor Pena Nieto's office, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that even surpassed that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is reported for their violence and the murder of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos believe that he has at least been inadequately dealt with the problem of women's murder during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typically for the downside area, Irinea Buendia fights with the tears when she shows me pictures of her dead daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana started suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her life-threatening.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the corpse star had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. There is a cross that bears a single word: Justice.
But exactly this, so the family, you've been denied it so far.
The authorities have treated me like I'm a wet woman, an unscrupulous woman, a blind man.
You want to just accept your judgment and keep your mouth shut.
"But this is not possible if there were so many form errors and omissions," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the President's pledge on Saturday, he will also assume a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been involved in violence crimes in the last six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope, as President, he is like he was Governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But just before, the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza feared the most.
The Public Prosecutor claimed: Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The Public Prosecutor rejects Bradley Mannings' proposals that he has been treated in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence seeks to dismiss the prosecution on the basis of harsh conditions of detention
The freeman of the US army is proposed to have removed thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the Public Prosecutor tried to find that the army-free Bradley Manning - charged with the greatest disclosure of confidential information from the U.S. history - missed several opportunities to complain about his alleged abuse in military.
At a cross-sectional mannings during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland explained May. Ashden Fine that documents on weekly visits to the prison officials during Mannings nine-month prison time in Quantico, Virginia showed no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the crusader, who was detained as a result of an application for a defense against the prosecution - Manning had already been punished by the hard prison time - Manning had said he would have considered the suicide in prison.
The secret service analysis of the US army arrested in June 2010 is proposed, while thousands of confidential documents have been stolen during its service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein and Manning went through the forms that the officials had completed after meeting with Manning during his imprisonment in Quantico military prison, where he had been under increased prison conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment through his wake as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, so fine, contained no complaints about maltreatment, although the officials had directly asked for his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and the officials had talked to him and told him to deal with them. However, they were not registered.
"They wrote (after discussing the concerns) "No problems" and that didn't necessarily mean that I didn't say anything at all," says Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011, which should examine his thoughts several months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to step down his observation status on "prevention of injuries".
The military said that he had been assigned this restrictive status - which is a degree under the threat of suicide - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince my employees that I was doing well and to release the observation status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday that he was arrested and deported to Kuwait, where he was detained for about two months before he was transferred to Quantico Marine Base Prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he considered suicide and became unconscious because of the heat.
Not knowing what happened to him or the outside world was a burden.
"My world collapsed on Camp Arafion, on this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
He's only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or just to lie down.
He always had to sleep with light, which penetrated from the outside into his cell.
If he turned at night and couldn't see his face anymore, he was woken up to return.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer formally objected to Mannings treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, military prison.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked for an indictment he had raised on Thursday in his statement - so he slept naked in his cell in Quantico and had to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had said that during this count he had never had the opportunity to deal with his deck.
On Friday's inquiry, Manning reported that he had concluded from a command of his watch that he should have let the blanket he could have covered fall. However, he said that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday Manning had said that he was forced to sleep naked the night before. He had previously tried to show an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning told the officer that he could have used the alliance of his underwear or flip-flops to hurt himself, but he did not.
This night, Manning said, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his prison experiences and reduce his sentence dramatically, he should be convicted in his trial before the Military Court, which is set for the beginning of next year.
The defence has stated that Manning will be convicted of minor offences, while other charges that are considered to be too extreme are to be prosecuted.
The continuation of the hearing is set for this weekend, and a justification of the prison conditions is expected from the Public Prosecutor.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been established in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners held under the highest security conditions in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the advantage of the enemy, the unlawful publication of confidential information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he is threatened with a lifelong penalty.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame immigrants - they call them hard times in memory, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a short trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the pass control when advicelessness was spreading in me.
Paintings refer to two waiting lines: one for "Mexico" ("Mexicans"), one for "Externaneros" ("foreigners").
I've been there for a few seconds, uncertain which one I should join.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexican" all my life.
An ethnic curve - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later, I decided to "Mexico-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for shorts or strips.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to say in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a mother speaker, and I'm not going to run my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the snake for aliens.
I thought about the moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda contained all the topics that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason for Mexicans to stay in Mexico today with equally high probability instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trading block, as the European Union did.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war on the drug cartel in Mexico, even if he did not mention details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resensitivity.
Most Americans are probably never missing a single thought that the United States entered Mexico in 1848 and forced the leadership of the country to leave more than half of its territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official even takes the mildest criticism of Mexico, one hears, in the Mexican press and among the country's elites, complaints about how the Americans undermine the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezumas are on the path of war.
And yet Mexico's biggest challenge lies in the truth in relation to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Would you like to talk about resensitivity?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parent or a parent - did not get a chance in Mexico and moved north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark, unimaginable, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our trust is in them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live in the American dream, attend good schools and have good jobs, we can never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we live in - not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes perhaps faded, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on mutuality.
You see us as a bait of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of the failure.
If our families weren't in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we would not see ourselves trapped behind the sidewalk - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, who legally immigrated as a child into the United States, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take these things for granted.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling of belonging neither to one country nor to another.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigers del Norte, but also Bruce Springstone.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but it's not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we'll be seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we'll be seen as Mexicans.
As I was supposed to learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education citizenship want to re-establish their links to Diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional ambassadors for Mexico who represent their interests in the United States.
We are going to tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and to exert pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico.
No, I don't.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of income, unabated corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure whether it really is a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for their treatment with Mexico a few and a half centuries ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a role to play in the way their family members were treated not long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old Fights, New Near East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected foundation arrow for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to fill such a hope in the Keim.
In the midst of the usual debt statements, countless buildings were placed in protection and ash, more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom killed civilians, and six Israelis - and for the first time rockets from Gaza were shot near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this confusion.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to assume that the mortal patsituation could finally end it.
A War That Will Not Be Lost or Winned
At first glance, optimism seems to be all but obvious in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21st, the weekly struggles have strengthened the hearts of both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement, which has been controlling the Gaza Strip since 2007, are claiming to have pushed Israel back, although his own group had to suffer great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are trapped in one of the most isolated and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas so far.
In fact, Hamas wins the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to their side.
Turkey, a growing, regional power that once considered Israel's closest Muslim allies, has taken over for the Hamas Party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jealous Hamas followers believe that Israel is an Islamic half moon - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hisbollah has power, over Syria, where rebels could stand before the destruction of Bashar Assads, until Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
In particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most populous and important Arab country at a distance - on the southern flank of Israel has changed the region's balance.
Hosni Mubarak, the Laizist Despot, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had only a little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on people’s views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot be forced out by Israel and the United States itself.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, are in favour of a contested conclusion.
The Hamas are no longer at risk.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has been able to prove itself, and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more peacefully.
In diplomatic terms, the United States maintains its position unscrupulously, and many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest violence.
In recent years, Israel has been well received, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process to a large extent.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the stork arrangements that have entered the West Bank and thus into the main part of a possible Palestinian state, but which protect the Jewish settlements which have been declared illegal, but are still being expanded.
Netanyahu is well standing there. His Likud party in the pre-elections on January 22nd under Avigdor Lieberman joined an even more fighting group.
Why do these restless Palestinians also hesitate and leave them a state of their own?
If they actually had control over the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets just like their rivals in the Gaza Strip?
No, it's better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them, they should dare to lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to implement themselves, but the Arab spring could make them a stroke through the bill.
Even if the Islamists who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries have little left for Israel, they will first concentrate on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defence situation is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to survive their economy.
The fact that the pragmatic President Mursi and Barack Obama have joined in order to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - perhaps symbolizing the beginning of a new era.
Israel too should think for a long time.
While the rest of the Arab world takes decisive steps towards democratization, Palestinians are still robbed of their self-determination rights - a powder spell that will undoubtedly explode in the Israeli-occupied areas, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only intensify.
Bloody missions to repress the Hamas in the Gaza Strip will be increasingly calling for their diplomatic tributaries over the years.
Both sides need an attack from outside
The right answer is the one that will be represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and this newspaper: two states in which Israel falls for security purposes.
The hope - for the near future - is that the ceasefire outside gives more influence to the implementation of this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar, stop arms supplies in the Gaza Strips and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the borders of 1967, complemented by regional traffic and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would make it more effective for the creation of a Palestinian State than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
And Obama must contribute his part to moving Israel into negotiations.
During his first term of office, he neglected the idea of his own plan of peace.
Far away in the white house, it seems as if he would have refused to participate.
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has an important interest in a stable Middle East.
And this is part of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform packs of cigarettes enter into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packaging equal to all tobacco brands
The world's first laws on uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia. This replaces brand logos and colours with a neutral, olive-green lid, which are also printed with drastic images showing sick parts of the body and children affected by cigarette smoking.
Apart from the various health warnings and images, the only difference between the packages in the brand names printed in identical, small letters is from Saturday.
In this way, Australia introduces the world's most stringent rules for tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government wants to stop young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government of studies, which have shown that people who have not started with 26, will not start again with 99% of the probability.
"You can see already in children young people that they understand the message to try to apply for tobacco groups with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that have shown children to associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia is one of the lowest rates of smoking in the world and the changes will only have a minor impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco club fought hard against the laws.
Thus it was stated that the laws would favour black market trade, leading to cheaper and easier-to-access cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian fakes will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
On the other hand, others say that the laws have warped their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarettes and silicon blankets has increased enormously to cover the inconvenient packages since the British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco, failed two months ago at the top Australian court with their attack on the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale businesses and is waiting for new stocks.
For us, it's a good deal.
According to experts, the hacks are in the popularity of social media in exactly the population group to which the plan is directed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, preventing them from acting as sports sponsors and forcing most dealers to stop smoking cigarettes in business. Now tobacco advertising is switched to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"He who markets tobacco and has only a small area left to apply for his products does not come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Freeman has seen an increase in experience reports about brands written by "very normal people".
You have to ask yourself: is this just a private person who finds so big cases of Marlboro cigarettes that they even record a video - or does it have a marketing agency to do so?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of focusing on marketing, the industry focuses on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain about unfair trade restrictions in the World Trade Organisation, although none of the countries are involved in greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries that consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to provide photographic warnings in 2001.
In the meantime, these have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are being considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
A lot of Australian smokes are still showing up.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a cup and throw away the box," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason why I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, a tobacco dealer "King of the Pack" in Sydney's downtown town, says the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill his regulature.
"I used to need an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," Yu says.
"The government should just ban cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's what we're doing," he apparently added.
In a constantly-electricized world it is nice to even be tired
I spent five hours in the airport waiting for this thanks when our plane fell due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight.
So I had enough time to make some thoughts for a while.
I don't want to lie.
A half day at the airport waiting for a flight is rather nervous - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts have for a long time been a positive one.
When it comes to them, it's for us - and our children - okay to be occasionally bored.
So the brain is forced to lose itself in interesting ways of thinking, which may contribute to creativity.
And because most of us today are almost constantly staring at one or other screens, the benefits of the ages are no longer beneficial to us.
So should we welcome the long time with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll come back for that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that for a long time it is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn't see that.
"In fact, the ages have a very long history," he says.
The house wall Pompeijs draws a Latin graffiti over a long time, which dates back to the first century.
And then there's still the question of how we actually define for a while.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York, Ontario, Canada, the problem is that time has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that for a long time as the experience to "want to pursue a satisfying activity, but not to be able to do so" can be defined.
For a long time, it is different from Apathie because the person is not busy, but it wants to be.
On the other hand, there is no need to do something about apathy.
The key experience of the long-term, he says, consists of a "distortion of the attention process, paired with poor pay and the feeling that time is just passing slowly".
For a long time, it can be heard almost as much as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions might be related, long-term people see the problem in their environment or in the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're boring, even if we're just having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to Germany for example: "The inactive mind: The definition of longevity in the aspect of attention", published in the September journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", points to Professor Eastwood and his colleagues as an earlier experiment, in which the participant belonged to a band on which a person had a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the nearby room that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at low volume, so it was hardly noticeable, while the third group did not even understand these sounds.
The people who barely heard the television reported that they had more time than the other two groups - they had problems concentrating on themselves, could not find any reason for this and wrote down their difficulties of time.
If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or challenging task, you can cause the disturbance of attention to a long time, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you practice a unique activity - "such as looking for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can break down and help you not feel tired".
In fact, as he says, we now know that resuscitation and critzels, often interpreted as signs for long periods of time, can even fight them by keeping people physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to go around learning more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain silent," says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored once - my late flight, a dreary speaker, a particularly depressing movie.
But some people get tireder than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980s a "scale to longevity".
On the scale, statements like "Many things I have to do repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys often become boring as girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of West Florida - especially as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external travel.
But in general teenagers are a rather relaxed herd.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment involving nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32% of the adults in the school and in the performance of the homework were bored, but 23% indicated that they were bored if they were not in the school.
But only 3% of parents gave up feeling tired.
Professor Larson today, 21 years later, says he doesn't know if the percentages have increased or decreased for the long term.
However, he was sure that "the youth will be particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their daily life.
So go back to my question of origin: Is long time healthy?
Sometimes it does not, because in the extreme case it causes people to take extreme physical risks and fall into the game of luck or drugs to relieve them - this has been shown by studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors study the relationship between longevity and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
"With the passing of time, the brain wants to tell one to do something else," says Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do right now.
If one is boring and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, you will be happy.
But TV can provide short-term happiness, but they run away long-term again.
So whoever has enough of an iPad for his tired child, it can end up in the long run. However, it has not learned to entertain or control itself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "self-control is transferred from one situation to the other".
The child not only learns to entertain himself, but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate for a while.
We should also not view them as too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to feel well beyond the constant activity and technology recovery.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we should be more boring. But for a long time it is the loathsome, insidious desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth, people are only looking for a way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly being overstimulated, it is difficult to deal with when the noise is out of the question."
In Colorado, there is no clear guide for the new marijuana law.
The 19-year-old Community College student and footballer Anthony Orozco stands before a trial in South-East Colorado, which will soon be legal in that state: the possession of a few less marijuana cracks and a pipe with which he smoked.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day with the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were arrested.
After the police officer found Marihuana in the car, Orozco was charged for possession of drugs and drugs - cavalry delicacy, each with a penalty of $100 - and received a term of court.
"We are treated like criminals," says Orozco.
But he's also one?
In the unknown weeks after the state's decision to legalise small quantities of marijuana for its own use, the answer to hundreds of small drug addicts depends less on the law than on the place.
There are hundreds of oppositions to the arrangements that are being made for Marihuana, both here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
The police authorities are pursuing adults over 21 years of age no longer for possession to a small extent. This is permitted by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the coming weeks.
But state prosecutors in the more conservative areas of Colorado have announced that existing Marihuanadelikts continue to be prosecuted and still cite people before the court.
At the same time, several cities, from the capitals of Denver to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana business from opening up in their communities.
"This situation continues so fast that I don't know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
And also regulators in the state of Washington crash their heads.
They are waiting for guidance to establish a licensing system for the production, manufacture, sale and sale of drugs - and have a deadline before 1 December 2013.
In Washington it is believed that Colorado is, in any case, the majority of the states, in terms of the regulation of Marihuana, where the drug was only legalized for medical purposes and then for its own consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Supervisory Authority for Spiritists in Washington State.
But Smith also adds that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and thus forms the end point of a grey zone in which the State licensing system does not yet exist, but the property is legalised.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified at this time - such as how the state's default of "acceptable access" to licensed marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis business around 300 metres around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Wherever it will be harder to find a place for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in Seattle's Balloon Area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21st, Chief Oates sent his employees to Aurora an e-mail stating that the prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller Marihuanadelicts in persons over 21 years of age, and that the police "from now on" will not seek criminal evidence for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to implement urban regulations for the regulation of farmers of medical marijuana and drug dealers would continue to be persecuted.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck has a more strict view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of Marihuana possession, mainly in order to move consumers to withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people have to be responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have also been accused of other crimes.
"Our authority has a duty to pursue violations at which it was a crime," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even in places like the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the Marihuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer shows adults for the possession of small quantities.
The District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to let all the pending property proceedings fall.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time doing the right thing until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was already clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of Marihuana with the complexities of government and the legal system.
And the conflicting reactions throughout the state among local officials encouraged a deep-seated breeding column with regard to the large green experiment to day.
In the case of district prosecutors, it is a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who is represented by Marihuanadelikts in court and acting on the ground as a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of Marihuanage.
"They have spent such a large part of their life pursuing people criminally that they still cannot accept legalization," he believes.
As the first countries to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are being treated as national patterns for the legalization of drugs.
While preparing for a period of legal sales by the public and public authorities, they also look forward to instructions from the Federal Government, which will continue to treat the sale and cultivation of Marihuana at federal level as a criminal.
The advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will be informed.
Despite several outstanding arrests by consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states to be the main part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Obama government drug policy advisor, is the view that criminal officials will probably not enter the doors to seize smaller amounts of drugs, but are likely to push themselves into the legal, state-regulated marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect the federal authorities to act at all.
Even before the election day, some local municipal administrations approved moratoriums for new marijuana business, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week Montrose decided, a city in the west, a six-month ban, which is probably adopted next week.
"We do not want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a major problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We look to what the congregation has decided on, and not to what the state has decided on.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was robbed from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students from today are attacked for their views
It's always been my biggest dream to get a seat at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited that university, which I once thought was the world's greatest stamp of knowledge, for a modern Greek symposia that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry to Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - there I had planned to study history - I had packed my suitcase again and thus led to the first scandal of my life.
My father broke up in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard, I would have gone because I had a problem with having fellows having sex in the neighboring room.
Author A N Wilson embitteredly, I would have left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged bags.
But the truth was less amusing.
I'm out of here.
Yes, I did, because I'm under systematic mobbing and threats.
Not because of my very unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had just been ridiculed for one reason - one reason which in this supposed range of enlightenment seemed so narrower and more cruel: My now dead father Woodrow Wyatt was an important advisor Margaret Thatchers and I am the supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of students suffers from similar persecution.
The organised and increasing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same protection of equal rights, benefit from the slums, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College state that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable because of their political views".
They ask for a place in the Committee on Equal Rights of their college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Its situation has been aggravated by a recently released documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", the towers as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
This included Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford University, who drove in a Rolls-Royce with silver-coloured suit and silver-silver gear.
In other universities, conservative students say they are considered "sin books for the introduction of higher study fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Student Association of Nottingham University, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing link trend in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without ever getting to know us at all."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a historical student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the search for greater protection, is the view that such a climate is "unacceptable". The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, appointed president of the Oxford Conservative Student Association, said she observed a growing rejection of students of moderate rights among JCR members.
"This poses a danger to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred for the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the university had agreed not to give an honorary title to Margaret Thatcher, an earlier student, due to a short term in high school.
The atmosphere would even scare Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students and tutors met, I got a taste for future events.
I had the experience that the tutors did not only tolerate the rejection of Tory students, but even participated in them with joy.
Political issues such as the mountain workers' race, the privatisation and rejection of the government of sanctions against the Apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the woodland areas of the tutorial.
At my first meeting, I should have translated French texts from the 18th century into English.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt (now dead), "please translate the first paragraph."
I'm stuck with it.
Pitt was a small man with a face like a kitchenette, and quite shy.
"Do thatcher followers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students were watching.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I suggest they take a few French hours in your leisure - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt said.
I came back with my head hanging in my room.
This evening, I sat alone in college at dinner, when someone pointed me slightly on the shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James, who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
Unfortunately, it's how it is.
Anyone who's suspected of being Tory is being sarcastic.
For me, it's bad enough, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is coming, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters provide to be followers of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I tried to change.
I was aware that I wasn't in all points with Mrs. Thatcher of an opinion.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A student in the field of philosophy, politics and economics who had ironically visited Eton College, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist.
You're ruined.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was stupid and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" asked one.
They hit each other, don't they?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet equals only after the dawn of darkness?
Should I join the Labour Party and have to suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that were ahead of me turned to a fire of reverence and isolation in front of my mind.
The only tutor who openly recognized himself as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only to be a conservative, but also because he had advised thatcher on foreign policy and had written for her.
He was only rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincially and petty and rejected it for its Marxist-deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started hanging between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more private friends and family members in the city.
I told my father I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed unfaithful.
During his 40s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming tower peaks.
Even my communist friends always put unconfirmed manners on the day.
His moist eyes were tired.
Give the whole guy a chance.
I'm sure you don't.
It would break my heart if you went.
Exploited by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance was weakened.
One of my male friends, also Tory followers, had given up the pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another historian seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly in shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a brainwash, and she called me "old trottel".
The relief only lasted for a short time.
It was my father who beat the last nail in my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes, my witches gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
I'd like you to call me a wine sleeper.
But no 18-year-olds should ever suffer from such fear and wickedness in an educational institution.
And it is even more tragic that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but is hiding behind an undeserved call for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino advocates elegance of fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC tells Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion company.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, which is worth hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This was recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grand retrospective for which more than 130 clothing of the skin Couture were made by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino has always pursued fascination for the sticky and distant world of Hell.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be seen until 3 March, there are a multitude of private letters and photos with the signature of the most famous aristocracy, initiated by Princess Salimah Aga Khan, via the Princess Marie-chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophies of his social rise from the modest fashionmaker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
Being in love in the Adele doesn't have to be harmful.
"At least they don't fit their dicks on your lovely carpet, as it does some beautiful celebrities from pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We are all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, closely friends with forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the modem.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to him at home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
On every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music he recognized and felt his influence.
"All guests felt important and loved," remembers the "Top model", which began their career at the week of Haute Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes..
Modern view of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of adultery, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-metre-long course that proposes a roll exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the course to admire a dreamy "audibility" that the masterpieces of Valentino wear, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte" or a coat of wool and leather belonging to Emperor Farah Diba.
In this audience, fashion dolls broadcast names such as Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria von Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit von Norway, Rosario von Bulgarien or Sofia von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and fashionmaker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a dress, a shirt, a west type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I attract him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the ex-herzogin of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have plenty of light and they highlight the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and opinion leaders at the fashion Patricia della Giovapaola d'Arenberg can not forget the first time she brought a Valentine.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came to this.
I bought my first Valentine's dress for a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a draped upper with a decolette that honors his name.
"It was a true dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, his occupation is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg maintains her evening clothes of the modem "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of Mode
The great finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashionmaker called his neighbors) were necessary to produce this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different stickers and a four-and-a-half metre long swivel.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the chief authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture in the late 20th century, "the return to the customers of the highest society".
For years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Art et des Lettres, awarded with the honorary region, garavani cumulates as many honors as every owner of his customers.
"I'm always his refining, his rest, his orderly and perfect appearance," says D'Arenberg.
I saw him last month at a gala dinner at the museum de Orsay.
He sat on the table of Count Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was useless; time leaves no trace on him."
And that's what a princess says...
The world's hardest profession: the human labour animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano play their lives and their health when they carry 70 kilos of sweat over the steep, rocky roads.
There are people whose work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by getting swivel from the Volkan Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To that end, he must climb down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the earth’s fluctuating greenhouse gas becomes stuck in contact with the air.
After breaking out large swivel stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos, he transports them into two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the exhausting path of stone.
It is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to an altitude of 2386 metres, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to climb in the sign-kraftettempo, keeping the balance and keeping their steps careful so that they do not break and break.
You know that every step can cost your life, as this happened to a French tourist who crashed on the Kawah Ijen partitions years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sweat they decompose.
Upstairs, they take the road between the tourists who photograph them like circuses and run with the tired heavy baskets three kilometers up to the scale, which a mining company has set a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been using the events in the volcano since 1960 and (no better said) its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for every kilo of sweat.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees per year (83 Eurocent) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely distributed throughout the day and is used for the manufacture of stringed wood, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we receive about 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) for each route," explains Anto, who normally makes three routes per day.
For each route he needs three hours of complete achievement, but then he has 138,000 rupees (11,5 euros) together at the end of the day.
What seems to be a miserable reward for such an inhuman effort, but the threefold is what he would earn with the fieldwork.
"The daily wage of the mine workers here, where the coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly income of two million rupees (167 euros) is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a waller on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sweat: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindus, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam".
And asthma breathes with difficulty, often coughs, and his eyes are swollen because of the toxic gas.
The 27-year-old Anto has been playing his life on Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sweat has already left his first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
And asthma, breathing with difficulty, often coughs, and his eyes are swollen because of the toxic gas from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for reaching his dream.
"I will be working here for two more years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but life-punishing young man could work as a tourist leader, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other bearers and stands up every morning for two hours, because the sweat also pours out at night, where his characteristic yellow color shines in the dark.
In the light of a small lamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money, he rises into the crater.
About 400 bearers load the basket with sweat on their shoulders on the floor.
Despite its great achievements, the mining company has not mechanized the welding industry to save costs, and delivers no equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
They also do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 Euro) supplement per camera, which the guards of this natural park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 Euro), require from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human tragedy.
"This work is for animals and not for humans" protests Madrusin, a strong 42-year-old carrier who has been working for three decades since leaving the school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and ensures that he continues to "salang goes", because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to rent, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sweat burns the throat and the eyes swallow when the wind turns suddenly and the miners enter the thick columns that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases ... of course except the usual breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders that have been shaped by the weight of the body.
With the basket on his back, Unainik is able to carry only 50 kg with his 53 years.
Every day he and his friends break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which is transported by three LKWs across a trail between the bay to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres away.
"I'm not going to rent, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," Unanik explains, saying, opening his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the oldest works with his 30 years as a swimmer.
The time has passed, but poverty keeps generation on to one of the hardest professions in the world: those who work as a human burden at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blame them for not having children on their careers, stress and the cost of property and child education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: We fulfill our citizens' duty and create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of a advertising for Minzbonbons, but yet - or just because of that - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local languages such as "Shives will become a "bao" (Laib) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, who has turned the video, is confident that the advertising site will reach a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative leader Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfill their "national duty".
This is just something for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When we were growing up, we were the worst in the world, so we realized that it was a matter of taking care of ourselves.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfumes with pheromones or the organisation of Speed-Dating evenings (fast Flirts).
Perhaps many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why don't we do something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as composing a rap?

Those who do not take this issue lightly are the Government of Singapore.
Each year they spend $1,300 for political measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of government for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, prolongs maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, which is also known for the conservativeism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans get any more kids?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the National Population Authority's marriage and family policy, says that this is due to "better education" and "higher career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to marry and form a family to have significantly more options on life goals and to set priorities," she explains.
These changes in the social situation have contributed to the higher number of singles and to the removal of the hierate and births, the result of which is the reduction of birth rates in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in migration to counter population reduction led to residence permits for the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely cassinated xenophobic blooms against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration will also be seen as one of the reasons why the Government Party in Singapore last year achieved its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequence
While the drop in birth rates shows the known effects on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
It already has effects on the housing market.
The City Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as the "schachatln" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the individual, and that they scare the construction companies from building a large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shitboxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold faster in days and even weeks than the larger housing units.
This leads to the fact that they are much better for our cash flow.
It adds, however, that the new standards give developers clearer guidance, which had previously been put in place when they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a state of town.
Even if these new rules could prepare the way for an increase in national birth rates, the talks with the Singaporeans working in the financial area are to be understood that they will not have much effect.
"The people are very stressed, the apartments and even the education are expensive, so it's out of the way," says one young manager.
The children can get others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women lead their careers, the stress and the cost of property and education as a reason they cannot have children.
That's why the Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to getting kids - that's where the government can do so much.
The offline private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, it is the property of private or "genuine area of private life, where one has a claim to protection against any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he poses when he publishes on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periodico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the Internet.
In four cases, they linked the term with "something very own" on a personal level and "on the password and user", when they used it on the social networks.
"My deepest secrets I wouldn't disclose in a post," says 10 years old Jorge when trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been having accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
At FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with people I know.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not of me, or of someone who makes the stupid head," he says.
The boy is aware that it's wrong to publish evil pictures of naked people, or to write political or violent comments.
Jorge ensures to meet 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are related.
Among them are the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I'm just loading them up" he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can speak quickly with relatives in the distance or with friends" he says.
Asked, he answers that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone recommended a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teen has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he may not know 20 of the people he has added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one has made claims to him or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone bothers me or demands it from me, I just remove it from my user account" he adds.
José reported to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boys are not familiar with the experiences you know today as cyberbullying.
The acquaintance of a friend was pushed into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never learned who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim has not closed the user account.
"He only did it privately."
After that, he explains a number of steps to configure a user account safely.
Unlike Jorge, these young people would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or painful situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he's unsympathetic to me or I want to take him out.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key Encipherment
Marielos Porras, a teacher for English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to guide children and young people, they need to understand that it is the purpose of social networks.
"The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information; however, the rules of the game changed with the appearance of these pages," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, owner of a master title in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" made these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who should teach them where we still learn ourselves," he says.
He explains that it is a complex issue, "because we require them to have a defined criterion on what can be spread, published or said, and this at an age where the tire is not sufficient for it."
"They should also be selective when it is their most important thing to be loved to have thousands of friends without considering the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people is to ask them what their privacy means to think about them.
"Tell them they shouldn't do it, it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then lists some possibilities: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Then why do you do it online?
Or: Would you like to have a photo published by you, like what you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
Have you asked the other people for permission before if you have tagged photos of holidays?
And one more question: Does everyone need to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to let them understand that they have to act online how they do it offline.
It's the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet deals with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Esturdo Guardia, university professor, elementary school teacher and educator, comments that it is inevitable that parents read the social network guidelines carefully.
When they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish" he explains.
According to Guardia, children need to be reminded of the lesson "You shouldn't talk to strangers."
Completion of the summit of the Unasur without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th summit of the Presidents of the South American Union (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and should be signed theoretically by the seven governments in place.
Efe repeated her attempt to gain access to the signed document at the VI. Regular meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and President's Office were first informed that they would pass it on to Klausur, but then explained that it would be published at some time on the Peruvian Government's website.
On questions about the text, they stated that the content of the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, was presented to the press in short statements.
The access of journalists to information on the summit meeting was limited at any time.
During the day, only the picture of the President's meeting was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulating among the journalists was received by the press speakers from some of the governments present at the meeting of the Unasur, but not from the Peruvian press speaker.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused hundreds of journalists from different national and international media dissatisfaction, calling for more information.
The president of Peru then sent an e-mail to the media with the final declaration of the summit, but it was Humala's statement, not the official document for the final outcome of the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the IIIth Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite a pressing call from the press, the so-called statement of Lima, which had previously been announced, was also not published.
On the official website of the ASPA, you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were available for journalists, but to a large extent limited access to information.
The summit also concluded with Chile and Peru's joint commitment to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which contributes to a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met at the regional meeting and confirmed that they would take the decision of the IGH, which begins on Monday in The Hague, in the process that started Lima against Santiago, to listen to the pleas of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences that we are currently bringing to this international court," Humala said together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is, and remains a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions for disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts," Piñera adds, welcoming Humala with a handprint in front of the flags of both countries.
The two presidents confirmed that they would submit to the IGH after Colombia, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious mistake, raised a complaint against the Bogotá Agreement, which agreed to submit to the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
At the summit, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were present.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 by President Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
President Ollanta Humala opened the talks on the morning and ended the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The Head of State left the final document, which announced that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set up over a total investment amount of $17 billion.
He said that the countries of the Unasur will take "significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He announced that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against insecurity in cities and against organised cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and the Internet at low prices in all South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "Economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not accept triumphing trains, but should serve to extend our production performance and show our people a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas ... and thus reconciling our countries with new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a read-only statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvians who are located on the Querachs of his territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not provide any further details.
The final document also covered the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations was another aspect that was highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participation in the regional meeting that on Saturday in Mexico, he expected a meeting with his opponent, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict with respect for a judgment of the IGH in question by Bogotá.
"Perhaps I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow," Santos said.
"We will examine all these ways - they are not only, and the Nicaragua Agreement also require talks with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will be civilized and treated as respectfully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intended to be present at the office of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit meeting, the Minister of Defence of the Block also met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which should strengthen dialogue and consensus on the region's defence.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the last country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional block.
"South America must learn in the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, and that "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th summit of the Presidents of the South American Union (Unasur), which took place in Lima, explained to the state television in Peru that the Europeans "were in the second world war and in other conflicts" and "are today practically a father country."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that the member states of the Unasur.
"It is true that the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the spirit community; however, there are still more reactive sectors that seek a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also endorsed the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OEA) as a condition to reduce the influence of the English states and to take into account those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never committed to anything, and in contrast, we are always signing the South Americans everything.
"It is inconceivable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its seat in Washington and is funded by the United States," he explained as an appeal to the political asylum that Ecuador gave to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured him that he did not regret this decision, because he did not betray his principles, but followed his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time there were "founded suspicions that assanging had been delivered to a third country and would not comply with its procedures."
He also criticised the Swedish justice he had requested him to submit to an interview in his country because of a alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish law allows this through a video conference that could have been conducted through the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."
Correa explained that the risk was that the health and mental state of Assange would be affected.
"Since he was in our message, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," said the Head of State of Ecuador.
However, there is a danger that he will suffer physical and mental damage because he is trapped in a narrow space and cannot perform physical exercises freely.
"This would affect the health of every person," he added.
Correa indicated that the solution for asylum, the assange was granted since June in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, was the granting of a letter of release, allowing him to travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that there was a conversation with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act on human rights, we do not apply this word for this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities , because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a series of procedures to various European institutions," he explained.
And "if the UK grants this letter tomorrow, it is done in my opinion."
And if Mr. Assange, on the ecuadors message in London or via Skype, heard about how Swedish law was allowed and was made in other cases, the problem was solved.
Correa took advantage of the opportunity to confirm herself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he did not tolerate "the mediocreness, the evil intent and the lies that express the free expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who are striving for and pushing for profit," he said.
In this sense, he was pleased that Ecuador was no longer of such journalists "and also not ruled by the banking or hegemonic and fiscal countries", and took the lead in a re-election of "the revolution will be deepened in order to continue the way in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next election, arguing that the organization "must remain hard and no opportunism and no legally declared state strike" because "the legitimacy of democracy was destroyed in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also holds the wish of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the ruling of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favoured the maritime state of Nicaragua, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries, "absolutely entitled."
This judgment is currently not implemented.
This is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that you can overlook them and look forward.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the maritime disputes between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and felt that "it is right for Latin America to call international bodies if both countries are obliged to take the decision, even if it is very hard to do so."
With regard to the possibility that he will be a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to succeed in his third term of office, he said that he sees this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is also very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I have never been personally interested in power, but under such unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one that guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to fulfill this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, then I would withdraw from public life.
This also applies when we lose.
"That's decided," he explained.
Correa also addressed the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just talked to the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he had traveled there for a scheduled routine treatment and that he would expect to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not in any way mean a return to the health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Heads of State today took part in Lima at the 6th summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was concluded with the call for greater regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of a death due to AIDS is too late recognition today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed with HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb was infiltrated," he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis that the doctor "tryed to weaken without detectable success".
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness by himself and began to inform himself about it; and this with such use that he was celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the Civil de Guadalajara Hospital (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time it avoided itself the director of an IMSS clinic to decide "because it led to a gas."
At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their disease and where the virus has already caused damage and has developed its immune system, and are the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases occurred, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who is taking treatment in time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG’s HIV head, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who said that this information was based on a scientific publication that was seen in April this year.
The specialist for infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death penalty, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of immunodeficiency of individuals at the start of treatment, and that those greater opportunities that are not drug dependent: up to 30 years when counting 200 CD4 and 50 years when counting 500 CD4.
Simply stated, the above statements mean that those who are diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25 can become "unproblemly 75 years old as long as they are under control", said this expert.
In order to ensure proper alignment of this progress, it must be remembered that the expectations of the Mexicans today are on average 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has decreased from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 cases in 2011 (UNAIDS Annual Report), it is nevertheless correct that 60 percent of the patients reported in the national database have died since the outbreak of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and up to May this year there are 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
- So why do people still die from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and that's how it's in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that people get in a much advanced state because they do not know their condition, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "nine out of ten patients come to us when they already have a companion infection. In order to influence global mortality, early diagnosis is necessary, so all people with this need must be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal is approved by the experts and officials of the Council of State of Prevention del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also by patients such as Fabrizio, who had carried out his test at a private laboratory, for the only reason that he had made a friend of him who was already in the AIDS phase despite his youth and even had the Kaposi-Sarkom (a cancerlike tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather be placed three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed myself well, drive sports and take the drugs.
Today his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, work a lot, have an active, but responsible sex life, I take care of my health and the other person," Fabrizio tells us that he agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate those who are afraid of the world's AIDS day with his testimony.
They should make the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsiblely like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the charger
Between the health programs and the simple citizen there are large gaps, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has accepted the HIV issue.
And the most important thing is prevention.
To certain places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; before they were given individually, now they give us a package with hundreds of pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"Why do you need it?" is a widespread question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, pharmacies employees and health systems that young people do not want to put up with, assured the correspondent.
He proposed to reorient this inefficient distribution; condoms should be located not only behind the shop, but in publishing devices in public toilets of institutions which are often visited by young people.
It is not intended to promote promiscuity.
It should not be paid to them the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González answered the question of whether to be distributed conservatively under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look that way; the best thing is to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he added.
Key data by Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is seen nationally in the 4th place of new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in the 13th place with regard to HIV.
92% of cases of ingestion occur via sex, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it for any registered case.
After the Court of Appeal of the United States has confirmed a judgment that does not recognise the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group, which was reached through a trade competition in Mexico, an unsound case of precedent for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country will create payment problems.
It could therefore be said that the procedures for the survival of companies which allow Mexican laws in the country of the Stars and Stripes in opposition to international agreements have no validity.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment received on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the Court of Bankcarrotas for the northern district of Texas leads to the loss of property outside the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico’s door and door to appeal to the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that the creditors must be subject to the United States competition law, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says first that it is the main proceedings for the trade competition in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in the insolvency proceedings of companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, the United Nations model law for the unification of international trade law was created for this purpose, and the American Law Institute was used as a shield.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the votes of the companies recognizing the obligations in the competitive mass that the branches of Vitro had had with their parent company, the necessary majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agrimex and Commercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed by the Group's Instituto Federal de Concurs Mercantiles (Fundessinstitut für Arbeits Contestes).
It is also true that, following the withdrawal of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro, i.e. the Geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37 per cent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro owes Vitro to its difficult situation since 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country a blow.
For this reason, the González Sada's family objected to the same appeal for a vote in the plenary, i.e. by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
If it is not done, the Cerciorare dispute shall be brought before the Court of Justice of the United States, which calls for the review of the procedure by a higher body.
The main point in this case is that the Court left aside a document sent by the Mexican Government under the figure amicius curiae (friend of the Court), describing the proceedings carried out by Vitro under the Trade Competition Act, and pointing out that it had adhered strictly to the agreements signed by the two countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Competition Act.
It is also pointed out that the country has submitted itself to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cases of cross-border insolvency guaranteeing the equality of debtors and creditors.
Double-banded carabols: a blow for vitro and for the country.
General budget
After the announcements by the Mexican air traffic unions against the former owner Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, who is accused of fraud, did not come forward for several months, the Association Union de Pilotos Aviadores finally made progress.
The request by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now submitted a criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is proposed to prevent justice.
The supervisory authority subsequently systematically refused to inform the principal administration of the Republic of Mexico of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur to remove 198 million pesos from Bank IXE’s trust account.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administra Professional de Hotels (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga is also the main shareholder of the Hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum at the University of Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the civil society decided to create a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, complementing a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
In the past, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Processing Industry) has managed to unite the Governors in the south-east to resist the monumental establishment that partially destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all industrial threats.
ACTA is dead
Because the government has failed to explain the conditions and circumstances under which Mexican ambassadors in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which is known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were carried out, although the Senate had considered the possibility, because it considered it to be a violation of the free expression of opinion in the social networks.
Homex long term
In the pursuit of long-term obligations without prejudice to short-term obligations, the construction company brings homex stock certificates over 500 million pesos on the market.
The issue is the first of four similar emissions that promise a interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competitive
Based on the company NYCE, e-quality and core, leading companies of information technology, a company group was established under the name Competival, whose objective is the service market of the software cluster in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to over 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world's basketball bomber, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to the basketball sport for more than 60 years and has traveled around the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the country's basketball history as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before a strike in 2008, Rex was a part of this sport for 6 years, either as a player of lower classes, players of the first national league, the Plenipotentiary and Head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball association.
"I spent a lot of my life in basketball, even though I was president of the BSN, head of the national team and president of the association in the 1990s," Reyes recalled at a visit from Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the Heart
The most emotional memories are those that at his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as players until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as a partner or manager of the club.
"It was my best years that I've enjoyed most, because I've been part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967 as a manager, business leader or coach.
There were many years of accomplishment, including the five championships between 1971 and 1975.
And then I agreed with a 1981 championship, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
Since then, "Cuco" has taken over Ortiz, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I still know that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m big player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the freelance specialist Raymond Gausse, who was a citizen and one of our best broadcasters.
I still know how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gaussian would have taken care of another.
The Vaqueros Championship with Gauss was awarded to him, but from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time he proposed to enjoy his achievements and those of Mincy in the national team.
I still know when we won the U.S. for the first time at the pre-lympic tournament in Mexico.
Then came the World Championship 1990, in which we placed the fourth place, which would actually have been bronze, if it had not been for this Canadian judge who had allowed us to repeat the last toy for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this World Championship 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 pan-American games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the US team a fight, as at the time when they won bronze against us at World Championship.
Not only were Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz) again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 due to a knee injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personality, but with which we won a gold medal and which brought us great joy, was that of the 1995 pro-lympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as replacement for the closed players due to the events at the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every forecast.
Who was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated on this level as Piculín.
And this, without considering his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is the best thing you've ever achieved in the relationship?
I was part of the most successful national team between 1988 and 1995, which included the BSN in the early 1990s to 17 teams in one season.
What are you still doing?
There are things I would have introduced, such as regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and only meet in national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children make unnecessary travel and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for trainers, table officers and divorce courts.
That's what I'm proud of.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, see videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and go and go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth (Texas) and was world-famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the Dallas TV series, where he played a skrupulous, domestic and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the hagier of the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new staff of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a press release from the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Lary was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role that he liked most," said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the birthday celebrations.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was at Hagman when he died at Dallas' hospital, her publisher, Jeffrey Lane.
He made all the joys he knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life in full train," Gray explained in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with Leberzirrhosis in 1992, and he added that he had been drinking a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman was known on television as a nice type in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Beautiful Jeannie" of the NBC TV.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he meets an attractive "dance" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live at home with him.
He was also representatives of two comedies, which were broadcast only briefly, such as The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included well-rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charming repugnant J.R., who made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the TV chain CBS over the Ewing-Clan and other figures in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement "Who shot J.R.?", the expectation of an episode full of emotions, where Hagmann's figure was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were put in competitive houses.
So the series reached an audience record at that time.
When the answer was announced in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million spectators who turned Dallas into the second most-seeing entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was Kristin who had shot J.R.'s wife (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had forced her and threatened to represent her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city. But others also had reason to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt, irreplaceable man with a charismatic smile: a sustained businessman and unfaithful husband, who then tried to expose his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what should be on J.R.'s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here is the honored citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only deal he hasn't won.
Victoria Principal, a co-sponsor of the original series, reminded Hagman on Friday as an "extreme personality up and out of the screen".
He is unforgettable and unforgettable to millions of lovers in the world, and remains for those who had the good fortune to know and love him in our hearts.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second staff was completed, and a sixth chapter was just turned, the sender informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT about how Hagmann's loss would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a young man when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck at the theaters in New York early in the 1950s, then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their residence.
In 2001, he used his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Talks about My Life".
"I didn't write anything that I thought could harm someone or harm him in any way," said the Associated Press in his time.
After liver transplantation, he was involved in liver donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet them when their operations appear and then," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "no fear, it's a bit uncomfortable the first time, but it's going to be good for you".
He also opposed smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Start of courses that study the "End of the World"
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as the Atomic War, Zombies, Virus and Keime and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course over the end of the world, he knew that he had an insurmountable fishing hook: the end of the Maya calendar's "long return count" on December 21, of which many people believed it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what he should expect in the following two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, whom some called "deudarmagedon", and a growing conflict with the participation of Israel, the place from which the Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester that ever existed," Charmé told the students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey) this week.
If someone analyzes what is happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the evil is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only professor to offer this semester, which should actually be the last one in history, courses about the "end of the world."
At the temple, Professor Barry Vucker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as the Atomic War, Zombies, Virus and Keime and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as how hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to certain human behavior.
If nuclear material reaches the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed the films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared to real life.
"I have tried to inform the students of what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," she said.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restaurant and his colleague Amara Solari, a visiting professor of art history and anthropology have formed a team to offer a course with the simple term "The End of the World".
"We do not take 2012 so that we always keep the option to keep the course new, in case the world does not fall short," said the restal.
Despite the "necessary understatement", students must study, create projects and participate in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is carried out on the evening of the Apocalypse, so the students have no other chance to "go on to work until night, where the world is supposed to end," said Restal.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there was no place any more," said the restal over his course for high-average students, who filled with 35 students.
A week before the start of the semester, we received e-mails from students who asked if seats were free.
The students assure themselves that the course is among the stakeholders.
"It's fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutger's Chamber of Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is, in fact, only a question of comfort or of its shortcomings.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa explains for psychology and health care to have seen all apocalyptic films.
"I have not heard anything from a teaching where this is taught," he said.
I'll enjoy it.
But none of the students questioned - and less than one professor - explained to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project treated the prophecy of the Mayas, and in some ways we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, a student in the last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Maya never foretold the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said the restal.
He notes, however, that in the Western society there is an apocalypse fear that brings back several centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"Somewhere people don't think that," he says.
This is mainly in the English-speaking world of the case.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches the Philippines this year, answers quickly to the question whether he would know a course there about the "End of the World".
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an adjudication to an exception to a higher instance.
We have an appointment from the Pope.
Restal pointed out that many days of the last trial had been talked about over the years, and said that if nothing happened on December 21st, "people immediately think about a new date" or that December 21st was the beginning of a seven-year period, which came to the end of the world.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrations about "the end of the world."
"I may call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
